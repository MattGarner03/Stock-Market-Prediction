===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on May 7, 2025. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Davidson: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with an update on our strategy and our trading businesses and Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Concannon: Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter 2025 financial results. I am pleased to report that we are seeing the benefits of our technology investments in our first quarter results, as shown on Slide 3 of my strategic update. In terms of revenue generation, our product and geographic diversification continue to pay off with record commission revenue in our international and new product areas like emerging markets, municipals and U.S. government bonds. We are very pleased with the growth we generated in the U.S. government bonds in the quarter, including a single day trading record of $102 billion on April 9. The strong growth in U.S. government bonds is being driven by increased velocity but also by more institutional clients leveraging our rates algos even during volatile periods. These clients are leveraging new algos to work larger block orders with low market impact over a specific time range, and the results have been impressive. Clients are executing billions and treasuries with 97% passive execution rates. That means institutional clients are not crossing the spread, 97% of the time using our algos. During the week of April 7, clients leveraged our U.S. Treasury algos to execute $36 billion or 11% of our trading volume that week. We expect to continue to expand our algo suite for rates and we anticipate launching an enhanced RFQ solution in the near future. Services revenue growth was also strong at 7%. In terms of expenses, we continue to show cost discipline, with expenses up only 2%, which also benefited from lower variable costs during the quarter. Last, on the capital front, we’ve been more opportunistic with our share repurchases as we move beyond just offsetting dilution from stock-based compensation. Our challenge has been U.S. credit market share across key protocols, which partially offset the growth we generated in other areas in the quarter. However, the exit rate in March was very encouraging with U.S. high-grade estimated market share increasing to 20%, and – the highest level since December 2023, driven by strong market share gains across the portfolio trading and dealer-initiated channels. On Slide 4, we highlight the key performance indicators for our trading businesses across channels in the first quarter. As this slide clearly shows, except for U.S. credit market share, the key performance indicators across our platform are largely green in the quarter, reflecting the underlying fundamental strength of our business. First, across our client-initiated channel, we generated record U.S. credit ADV, up 2% to $9 billion. We saw strong growth in international products with record ADV of $6 billion, up 11%. EM local markets are the largest opportunity in EM from an addressable market perspective. We produced record local markets ADV of over $1.5 billion, up 8%. Our performance in municipal bonds is also a positive example of our product diversification strategy with ADV up 42%. We are very pleased with the liquidity coming from our partnership with ICE Bonds, which started with municipals and has now extended to U.S. high-yield and U.S. investment grade. We experienced another quarter of strong growth in automation with record trade volumes of $110 billion, up 17%. We had 249 active automation clients in the first quarter. We now have 80 clients enabled for our Algo suite, up from 25% in the prior year. Open Trading ADV hit a record $5 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8%. The Open Trading share of total credit was 38% in April and Open Trading volume hit record levels during the second week of the month across credit markets. Our share of blocks in U.S. high grade was just over 11%, up slightly from the prior year. In the portfolio trading channel, we generated record total PT ADV of $1.3 billion and record U.S. credit PT ADV of $1.1 billion, with market share of 19%. The – Last, in the dealer-initiated channel, dealer RFQ and Mid-X ADV was a record $1.9 billion, representing a 45% increase over the prior year. As promised on the last earnings call, on Slides 5 and 6, we want to update you on how we are executing across the 3 critical channels we are attacking to grow U.S. credit market share. First, in the client-initiated channel, we made progress with our block trading solution. We registered record total block trading ADV in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets and Eurobonds in the first quarter. Year-to-date through April, block trading in U.S. high grade is running up 27%, U.S. high yield is up 19%, and – emerging markets is up 22% and Eurobonds is up 71%. And – our cumulative block trading volume since the launch of our targeted block trading solution in emerging markets and Eurobond was $4 billion through April 2025. We are rolling out our full high-touch block trading solution in U.S. credit to our broader client base as we speak. This is really exciting because we are delivering a click to trade solution where the trade is against a dealer acts or an indication of interest and the trade goes direct to the dealer without information leakage. This strong performance was driven by our client sales outreach we have been doing for our targeted block solution. Next, in the portfolio trading channel, which is a very important part of the market, we generated record levels of portfolio trading ADV with strong increases in both U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield estimated market share in Q1. U.S. high-grade portfolio trading market share was 19% in the quarter, up 520 basis points over the prior year. U.S. high-yield market share was 18%, up 690 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date through April, U.S. high-grade portfolio trading estimated market share is running up 310 basis points compared to full year 2024 levels, and U.S. high yield is running up 260 basis points. So again, very strong progress with the portfolio trading channel. Last, in the dealer-initiated channel, we are beginning to see progress as we prepare to launch a new MID-X solution later this quarter in U.S. credit. Dealer RFQ ADV was a record $1.8 billion with record ADV across U.S. high-grade, emerging markets and municipal bonds in Q1. We – U.S. high-grade dealer-initiated estimated market share increased almost 100 basis points year-over-year. We are very excited about the launch of our new MID-X solution in the second quarter, it is a very streamlined API delivered high-performance matching solution for dealers. Slide 7 highlights our strong growth in April, continuing the trend of March on a significant increase in credit market volatility. With the recent increase in volatility, we have seen spreads widen, liquidity needs increase and the velocity of trading increase. We saw Trading ADV grow 68% year-over-year to a record $57 billion, driven by strong growth across all products, including 32% growth in total credit ADV to a record $18 billion and 93% growth in total rates ADV to a record $39 million. Most importantly, U.S. high-grade market share of 19.4% was 120 basis points higher than the prior year. We also saw a significant increase in the ETF market making activity in U.S. high yield in April, the highest level since November 2023. Before I turn the call over to Ilene, let me make a couple of observations about the market, the recent volatility and how our platform is responding. First, the velocity of trading in U.S. high grade has risen to levels we have not seen since 2011, which is great for our market and further electronification. Portfolio trading, a key protocol that has fostered increased velocity has continued to perform at high levels despite the increase in volatility. We – Portfolio trading was approximately 11% of the U.S. high-grade market in April, in line with prior periods, reflecting its resiliency as a risk transfer tool. Last, one of the most exciting aspects of this increase in volatility has been how our clients are increasingly willing to execute greater size through automation during times of volatility. Our largest and most sophisticated clients continued to increase their automation risk tolerance in March and April with over 2,500 automation trades of $2 million or above over the 2 months, the highest 2-month period ever. Also, we generated record U.S. high-grade block count leveraging Auto-X during the March and April period. We believe that our strong results were driven by the progress we have made with our new initiatives as well as the significant increase in market volatility. Now let me turn the call over to Ilene to review our financial performance.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Thank you, Chris. Turning to our results on Slide 9, we provide a summary of our first quarter financials. We delivered total revenue of $209 million, compared to $210 million in the prior year. Looking at each of our revenue lines in turn. Commission revenue decreased 2%, largely driven by lower fee per million and market share in U.S. credit, partially offset by strong market volumes on an increase in volatility beginning in March. Services revenue increased 7%, driven by a 9% increase in information services revenue to $13 million. The increase was driven by new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+. Post-trade services revenue of $11 million increased 3% versus the prior year. Technology services revenue of $3 million increased 14%, driven by higher Pragma-related license and connectivity fees. Total other income increased a little over $3.5 million, due principally to higher interest income of approximately $1 million, higher mark-to-market gains on our U.S. treasury portfolio of approximately $1 million and lower levels of FX losses of approximately $1 million. We’ve reported diluted earnings per share of $0.40 or $1.87 per share, excluding notable items in the quarter, which included a new reserve which we established for uncertain tax positions. This reserve is being established for prior periods through the first quarter of ‘25. Based on a recent ruling in a case that MarketAxess was not a party to that was not supportive of the company’s historical tax filing position, this decision reversed a lower administrative court ruling that had been supportive of the company’s position. The go-forward effective tax rate will move higher to accrue for the expected increase to the tax reserve in 2025, and I will provide updated guidance on the effective tax rate later in my presentation. On Slide 10, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue was $181 million, compared to $185 million in the prior year. We experienced growth in credit commission revenue across emerging markets up 6%, Eurobonds up 5% and municipals up 6%, and – which helped partially offset a 7% decline in U.S. credit commission revenue driven by lower fee per million and lower market share. The reduction in total credit fee capture both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was driven principally due to product mix. On Slide 11, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses of $120 million increased 2% compared to the prior year. The lower level of expense growth was principally driven by continued cost discipline and lower variable costs due to the slower start to the quarter in January and February. While the pace of operating expenses was lower in the quarter, we have continued to invest to drive future growth. Headcount was flat year-over-year but down from 891 at the end of 2024. On Slide 12, we provide an update on our capital management and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with cash, cash equivalents and corporate bonds and U.S. treasury investments totaling $642 million as of March 31, down from $699 million at the end of 2024. The decline in cash was due principally to the annual payout of full year 2024 cash incentive compensation in the quarter in addition to the share repurchase activity during the quarter. We generated $344 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, an increase of 5% over last quarter. We repurchased 251,000 shares year-to-date through April 2025 and for a total of $52 million, including 188,000 shares repurchased during the first quarter at a cost of $38 million. As of April 30, 2025, $173 million remains on the Board authorization. We believe we are striking the right balance of investing to drive future growth, while at the same time being disciplined stewards of capital. Before I turn the call back to Chris, there is no change to our previously stated full year 2025 guidance for services revenue and capital expenditures. Based on the progression of our operating expenses in the first quarter, we are refining our full year 2025 expense guidance and now expect to be at the low end of the previously disclosed guidance range of $505 million to $525 million, including the impact of RFQ-hub, which I will discuss in a moment. And I would remind you that variable expenses can change depending on operating conditions. While we are refining our expense guidance, we are continuing to strike the right balance of investing to drive our future growth. Additionally, given the notable items discussed earlier, we are updating our full year 2025 effective tax rate guidance range. On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%, and – due to the reserve I mentioned previously. The effective tax rate, excluding the notable item in the first quarter is expected to be in the range of 26% to 27%. Before I turn the call back to Chris for closing remarks, we expect to close the RFQ-hub transaction later in May. This will bring our ownership to approximately 90%, and we will begin consolidating RFQ-hub in our financials. For full year 2024, RFQ-hub revenue was a total of $13 million, and we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 20% in 2025 as we integrate the offering into our product suite. We expect to include most of our Q-hub revenue in other variable transaction fees within total commissions, but we also expect approximately $750,000 of connectivity fees to flow through our technology services line. The incremental expenses related to the consolidation of RFQ-hub are expected to be in the range of $7 million to $9 million for 2025 after the close and are included in the new full year 2025 expense guidance I just noted. For modeling purposes, we expect approximately $2 million in incremental depreciation to flow through the depreciation and amortization line in 2025. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Ilene. In summary, on Slide 13, we made solid progress with the key new initiatives that will drive improved market share in U.S. credit in the remaining quarters of 2025. We – we generated record levels of block trading across U.S. high-grade, emerging markets and Eurobonds, which have benefited from the launch of our targeted solution. Our portfolio trading solution continued to hit record ADV trading levels and our market share in U.S. credit continues to expand. Record dealer RFQ ADV reflects our increasing focus on this important channel with record ADV in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets and municipals. Our strong progress across the client-initiated portfolio trading and dealer-initiated channels, combined with the increase in credit market volatility should help drive higher levels of market share in U.S. credit in the coming quarters. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Chris Allen of Citi. Your line is now open.
Chris Allen: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to – hoping you could unpack for increased share gain moving forward. Can you help us frame out what are realistic expectations here? How dependent are show gains on the environment continuing at some of the recent levels? And how do you think about the impact of new capabilities on share gains from here?
Chris Concannon: Great. Thanks, Chris, for your question. First, I’ll address the market environment because the current market environment that we’ve been experiencing certainly in March and leading into April is favorable to our business model. We are obviously seeing in this environment, a lot of uncertainty, I would call it an environment of uncertainty, where there is economic uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty and certainly questions around direction of rates. Obviously, the market is now predicting rates will head lower which couldn’t be favorable for us. Certainly, any rate moves is largely favorable to the turnover that we see in the bond market. But most experts right now are predicting higher levels of volatility, not returning to those lows that we saw certainly in 2024. So it’s not just a business model on tweets about tariffs going forward, but we do see higher levels of volatility in the market. Spreads remain slightly widened relative to what we saw in January and Feb. And our clients’ liquidity needs have risen since last year. We are hearing more and more from clients about need for liquidity and need in particular for alternative liquidity, that’s all favorable to our business model and so from a market environment. The one piece we haven’t seen is credit quality challenges. If there are any macroeconomic impacts, we could expect to start hearing about credit quality, which would have an impact on spreads and obviously, change investor outlook around portfolio holdings, which could increase turnover. With regard to our growth opportunity in this market, one, I think the – the market opportunity that we have is expanding because we have changed our model to be what we call protocol agnostic, by delivering clients multiple protocols to solve different execution needs for different sized orders, different shaped orders like portfolio trading, block trading and then also addressing the dealer-to-dealer market. We think our opportunity for growth is increasing given both the market environment and the deliveries that we’re making in this year. In terms of this quarter, we are excited about the number of product releases that we see in the coming quarter as well as the future quarters. We’ve made sizable investments last year, and we’re feeling the impact of those investments as we roll out additional items. First, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we’re launching our high-touch block solution on the back of our already launched targeted block trading solution that we launched in EM and Eurobonds. And that is literally launching next week. So we’re super excited about of being able to deliver a block solution to our clients where they can trade directly with dealers. We also mentioned the launch of Mid-X coming this summer, an exciting new addition to our protocol mix for dealers. Again, this is a dealer targeted solution to address dealers’ needs to trade at mid-market as they exit their inventory. We are also rolling out X-Pro into Europe this summer and excited about the benefits that X-Pro brings not only from a portfolio trading perspective, but also just a workflow perspective and the ability to deliver data and analytics to clients as we roll that tool out, not just in Europe but further rollouts into EM as well. So, when I look at this environment, Chris, and I look at the number of product releases that we have coming in the current month – in the coming months and quarters, I’m just very excited about our opportunity to grow, particularly around what you’ve seen in portfolio trading, the dealer-to-dealer, but also the block trading solutions that we’ve delivered to the market, so feeling very good about both market environment and our delivery schedule for forward growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm: Yes, hi, good morning. Just staying on the environment a little bit and sorry to slice and dice the month or the environment, but some people talk about April almost in two halves and you yourself mentioned some of the record days in the early part of the month. So just wondering what you saw maybe in the first half and second half, given that it was clearly very, very elevated and very good. But curious what kind of things kind of stuck in terms of client behavior and chair and where maybe things started normalizing a little bit, just as we think about the second quarter from here?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Obviously, we saw accelerated market velocity in April, seeing some records across a number of protocols, but overall market volumes were up substantially in April and high yield in particular, we saw record market volumes up 42% year-over-year, so just sizable velocity in the market. What’s very encouraging is that the market is able to sustain that level of velocity. So without electronic trading and the broad electronic trading penetration, you just wouldn’t be able to see that level of market turnover. We continue to see that velocity in – throughout the month of April and into May. So we’re encouraged that overall turnover remains heightened. As you mentioned, Alex, volatility spiked and did come down, but it never rested back at a low point. So we’re seeing even – at lower levels of volatility relative to the beginning of April, we’re still seeing evolve stay at a somewhat heightened level and more encouraging spreads remain at a heightened level relative to January and February. So the market environment, while we’ve come off our peak volatility and those were quite some peak spikes during the tariff wars back and forth. We’re still at a very attractive market environment for our business model. We continue to hear from clients both in high yield and EM asking for liquidity needs and saying – suggesting that the liquidity in the market is not robust. So that’s always encouraging because they tend to lean on our Open Trading alternative liquidity in that type of market environment, so encouraged by the current market environment. While it’s not at the peaks that we saw in early April, it’s still a relatively sustained volatility that we’re seeing in the market. And that’s before we’re seeing any rate adjustments or any challenges, macroeconomic challenges that could come.
Alex Kramm: Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is now open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Maybe if I could just ask a question on fee capture and particularly wondering if you could update us on what you saw for high-grade fee capture in 1Q and the high-grade capture number that’s embedded in the April metrics you released earlier this week? I am just wondering if you could help us understand really what’s causing the year-on-year and the quarter-on-quarter declines that we saw because I think at first glance, higher Open Trading share, I thought would have been incrementally helpful. But I know there is a number of other factors at play with PT growth and block growth, for example, which could continue as we’re looking at launching the U.S. block solution into the second quarter?
Chris Concannon: Great. I will start and let Ilene fill in some of the gaps. First, what I will do is take a step back and talk about fees holistically. I think it’s a good topic. Just given what I talked about previously around being protocol agnostic, we are investing heavily in delivering multiple protocols to both clients and dealers and with that level of focus, you saw performance in the first quarter, and that performance continued into April. These are two market protocols that have grown in the overall market, portfolio trading and the dealer-to-dealer business has grown substantially year-over-year and over the past couple of years. Portfolio trading somewhere around 10% of the overall market and the dealer-to-dealer market is somewhere around 30% of the market, which is up sizably from prior years. So, we are investing heavily in those areas. Those obviously come at a lower capture rate. And so with any success in portfolio trading, or dealer-to-dealer, you tend to have pressure on your fee capture as well. We did – what was interesting in April, we did see heightened levels of portfolio trading in high yield, literally record levels of portfolio trading as high as 15% for the full market, which we haven’t seen before. What we heard from clients was just large – large sell-offs required because of large redemptions coming into funds, both in managed funds as well as ETFs. Those heavy redemptions in high-yield funds led to a lot of clients choosing to use PT as a liquidity solution. And that had us in turn, have record levels of portfolio trading. So, those items are impacting our fee capture, but they are growth items for us. So, while they come in at a lower fee capture, we are encouraged by growing revenue by delivering new protocols and new solutions to our clients. The nice thing about where we are headed, things like block trading and growing further in the portfolio trading solution space, those are areas that have low variable costs and in fact, some come with no variable costs. So, they are higher margin businesses, but they can be seen as lower capture rate. So, for example, our block trading rolling out can be delivered at a slight discount to our traditional RFQ, but it comes with no variable cost for us. And so we are headed into a place where we are delivering more protocol, some of which comes at a lower capture rate, but some of which has lower variable costs associated with it. Ilene , do you want to add something?
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Sure. So, Kyle, let me give you a little bit of the puts and takes that you mentioned in terms of the April versus March, right. So, we saw that increase in fee per million for about – which was about $4, right. And that was driven – really driven by more favorable product mix. And if you think about the – we had increase in high-yield activity, that was worth about $2. We had benefit from higher duration of about $1 to your IG question, right. And we saw weighted average years to maturity out a little to about 8.7% in April, 8.7% weighted average years to maturity. And then in terms of the mix of business, and you are right, Open Trading activity was up about $4, but we saw that partially offset by the increase in portfolio trading in the month, which was – went the other way by about $3. So, hopefully, that gives you the puts and takes. Your premise is right, but it kind of goes back to what Chris was saying, which is that as we are continuing to gain share and as we are continuing to do more volume in some of the other newer protocols for us, these are incremental revenues, but they do come in at a lower fee per million.
Kyle Voigt: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael Cyprys: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back to portfolio trading. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on what you see driving the strength across your PT solution I believe you had brought some new innovation with – I think it was a net hedging for IG embedded in PT in the quarter. So, more broadly, maybe you could talk to some of the feedback and traction you are seeing with PT as you look out over the next 12 months, 24 months, where is your scope for continued enhancements and innovation with your PT solution? Thank you.
Chris Concannon: Sure. And I appreciate the question. Obviously, we have been talking about our investment in portfolio trading over the past year, and we are seeing the returns as a result of those investments. There are a number of enhancements that we have delivered. Obviously, our new X-Pro platform just makes the workflow smoother, allows our clients to have more line items see pre-trade analytics, evaluate the portfolio that they are loading and pick and choose winners and losers that are in those portfolio trade portfolios, that can improve price. So, there is a way for clients now to evaluate what’s costing them price in the context of the portfolio. So, all of those enhancements were delivered through X-Pro. We are now seeing 92% of portfolio trades on X-Pro, so it’s clearly the platform is winning the market share in the portfolio trade environment. The other places, as you mentioned, delivering and having clients sign up for all of the net hedging, auto spotting, all has been delivered and the feedback has been quite positive. Ultimately, portfolio trading will come down to analytics, data and analytics, and that’s where the constant demand is, is understanding when is the right time to trade a portfolio versus when it’s the right time to trade a list via RFQ, those are important questions we are hearing from our clients. Optimizing the portfolio, the more correlated you are to an ETF, the better pricing mix you get from dealers. And then optimizing your size within a portfolio, if you have block size line items, you can degrade your pricing in PT. So, all of that requires pre-trade analytics and the demand for pre-trade analytics, continues to grow. We are obviously planning on enhancements in the coming weeks and the coming months for our PT solutions. So, we are excited about what we achieved in Q1, which followed into April and what’s ahead for portfolio trading.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Alex Blostein: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Another one around PT for you guys. I was hoping you could break down the composition of the ADV in the quarter between the single dealer and the in-comp ADV that you cited. And I heard the discussion around fee per million, that all makes sense. But can you help us just frame what the fee per million currently stands today at portfolio trading and I guess dealer RFQ as well, since these are two of the larger protocols that are growing right now for you guys. Thanks.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: So, Alex, in terms of sort of how we are thinking about portfolio trading and we have, obviously, you saw in April, the overall market share there was investment grade was pretty positive. And we saw fee in comp was 19.3%, and the – it was 19.4% I believe, all-in. So, I just want to double check that for you. And so that’s kind of, again, positive. And then if you think about the market share in high yield, that was in-comp 13.5% and 14.1% in terms of all-in, right. So, some real positive moves there in terms of how we were doing with high yield and investment grade. And so we know, though, that if you think about portfolio trading in general, that those come in at a lower fee per million, we know that that single dealer is really not something that we have fees per million on, and that’s not really included in that because if those come in without it. So, I guess this is all to say, as we continue to see investment grade and high-yield shares pick up and more of that becomes portfolio trading, we are going to expect to see continued pressure there on the overall fee per million. But again, it’s really good for share. It’s good for what we are looking to do overall. Chris has talked about how we really looked at block trading as something that’s a real opportunity for us incrementally. And the portfolio trading and the block trading folks are really often the same desk. And so, this is something we are really pleased about. We are pleased about our progress, but we know that this is going to come in at some fee per million pressure.
Chris Concannon: And I will just add, Alex, because it’s a great question, because that’s an area where, obviously, we have been investing and continue to invest in. In the past, we have said that expect month-over-month volatility in market share because of PT, single-dealer PT obviously, can swing share, those are what we call the mega PTs over $1 billion in a single PT. And they do swing share, if you look at our high-yield market share. It was – it increased sizably in comp, so total in comp, but it had a material pickup because of a single dealer PT during the month. So, again, that point is, it will have an impact on our capture month-over-month. And single – the dealer-to-dealer business as we invest in that, we will also continue to have further pressure on our fee capture. Again, our goal is to grow revenue and grow it through all the different protocols. We price our protocols based on the market of the protocol, not our overall fee capture. And so we are being very mindful of what that market looks like and when we are pricing into it. The good news on fee capture is our client to dealer RFQ business and fees have been quite stable and remained stable as we speak today in May. So, we feel very good about the stability of pricing across our core business, which is traditional RFQ in high-grade, high-yield and now EM.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: And then, Alex, just to follow back because I think you also asked just about PT share in addition to high grade and high yield. If you look at April PT share, that was in comp at about 20.5% and the single dealer piece of that was about 1.3%. So, the overall market share there in April for us was about 21.8%. So, that was also a really good positive indication.
Alex Blostein: Great. Awesome. Really helpful stats. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jeff Schmitt: Hi. Good morning. So, what have you learned from the rollout of enhanced block trading in EM and Eurobonds as you look to launch that in the U.S.? And do you see any potential hurdles to adoption here, anything that may be different in this market?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Great question. And again, we launched – in EM and Eurobonds, we launched targeted RFQ, a slightly different model from the way folks trade here, and particularly in IG and high yield. Target RFQ has had a positive response. Obviously, our block trading market share has increased. We saw a block trading record volume in EM. Again, that’s partly driven by targeted, but also largely driven by clients coming in and trading larger block size on the platform and getting liquidity in our all-to-all solution in EM. The feedback from clients is very positive. They want to be able to trade larger size electronically without information leakage. And the concern on information leakages, if you go out to an all-to-all RFQ requests, you are leaking obviously, your larger block size to the broader market. So, using a targeted solution protects your information, but allows you to maximize price improvement by marketing it to a few dealers rather than all dealers. As we have been certainly going out to clients in IG here in the U.S. with our high-touch block trading solution, which rolls out next week, feedback has been quite positive. Again, we are competing with the phone and with chat. So, when it comes to competition, being able to click to trade, your workflow for blocks is quite powerful and that feedback has been consistent as we demo the product to clients and they give us the feedback on the seamlessness of the workflow, the ability to go to a single dealer and engage that dealer fully electronically without going on chat. So, both the targeted solution that we launched in EM and Eurobonds is yielding results with our block trading stats, but we are excited about the client feedback we have heard in our high-touch solution rolling out next week.
Jeff Schmitt: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Patrick Moley: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, we are hearing more and more about these alternative liquidity providers and market makers wanting to expand their presence in the credit market. So, I was hoping you could just update us on what your conversations with these alternative liquidity providers has been like? And what protocols do you find that they are looking to utilize most. Your competitor has indicated that they have been very interested in portfolio trading. So, just curious if that’s the case at MarketAxess as well. Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Great. Thanks for the question. And certainly, we have seen an influx in demand coming from what I will call alternative market makers systematic hedge funds, that influx has been over the last couple of years, actually our hedge fund community continues to grow. We continue to see record volume from that community as well as from your traditional ETF market makers. So, that – we saw sizable growth record levels of volume from the ETF market makers and the alternative liquidity providers. We have a strong pipeline of alternative liquidity providers. The number one protocol that they are requesting from us is our all-to-all RFQ solution. They want to be able to price a large client requests for price, they want to respond to inquiries and they can do that anonymously, without facing those large clients. The challenge for these alternative liquidity providers and you find it in portfolio trading as well is many of them are not prepared and many of the clients are not prepared to face them directly for settlement. So, the all-to-all traditional RFQ protocol is in higher demand from alternatives. They also typically trade large baskets across a large number of bonds because they are trading against the ETFs, so they tend to trade smaller size across the RFQ landscape. So, the good news is we continue to see more come. Some of them have come from both the FX and treasury markets and moved into credit, but they continue to grow and they continue to demand our proprietary data. So, there are data demands coming from that group because they are largely API-driven, consume a lot of data and trade a lot of product in a higher velocity level of trading. But the key ingredients for them is the anonymous to our solution where they don’t have to disclose their name or face any clients from a settlement perspective.
Patrick Moley: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Budish of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Chris O’Brien: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Chris O’Brien on for Ben. I had a broader question on the capture rate and just kind of thinking more broadly across, I know you said that you price by protocol and kind of what you are seeing in the market there. So, I was curious how you are kind of positioning your pricing competitively. And if there is any way or to the extent there is capacity that you could use that as a lever to drive more share growth moving forward?
Chris Concannon: Great question. And again, we do price by protocol. We think about what the market is requiring from each protocol. I think in the dealer-to-dealer space, that’s an area where clients are quite price sensitive. And so we have certainly adjusted price and with our Mid-X launch this summer, we will be pricing that in the market that requires a lower level of fee capture. So, we will be targeting that market with what we think is an appropriate price given the demand by dealers. Again, we are not really touching on our client-to-dealer pricing, that has been quite stable and we intended to remain quite stable. I think it’s important to point out that there are other players in the market, smaller players in U.S. credit that have been free for quite some time, and we haven’t seen any impact in our core business, as a result, I think Bloomberg has been free for years actually and we don’t see any competitive pressures in that area. So, we feel good about the current pricing levels that we have in the client-to-dealer space. I think where you are seeing appropriately priced product is really in the dealer and portfolio trading space. The more exciting piece of the market is really the next, what I call the next 50% of the market, which is the opportunity to grow electronic trading against the phone and chat market. That market is sizable and it’s a quite vulnerable market because it is not ideal workflow for our clients. We hear it continuously from them, they would much rather connect with a dealer and price a bond electronically than type it out on chat to get an execution. So, that market is obviously an attractive market for us. We think it’s – we will attack that market with appropriate pricing. But again, it’s a different protocol, will require different pricing levels as well. I will say, I don’t – we don’t sit here and feel a lot of pricing pressure in this market. I think where all the competition is in the client-to-dealer space is all around workflow, data analytics. And so the biggest pressure that we feel is delivering new product with new execution solutions, with new data, new analytics to help our clients trade better. In the environment we sit in right now where it’s more difficult to trade, clients are only talking about data and analytics and their demand for data analytics is growing. We do not talk to our clients about pricing and pricing pressures. Hopefully, that helps.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Yes. And let me just add a little bit to what Chris had, which is if you think about sort of the bifurcation of this in terms of the macro level and on the product mix and trading activity as sort of another level of how you think about our capture, right. So, on a macro level, a combination of lower rate environment, upward sloping yield curve for high grade and a higher mix of high-yield volume can make a positive difference. We know that the pace of Fed cuts, however, is constantly moving, and that’s something you are going to have to factor in. We know the most recent CME Fed watched out that, for instance, is predicting three to four cuts this year, but we are going to have to wait and see. Now, back to what Chris was talking about in terms of product mix and trading activity, the growth in PT, we know has downward pressure on capture. That is, we have been talking about that for a while now. However, if we get back the impact of lower levels of high-yield activity that we have seen, and we see more of that on the platform as we have seen volatility return, as we see ETF market makers clients get more active that’s going to be a positive, right. And then Chris has said this, but I really want to reemphasize that our core fee capture protocols for core RFQ have remained steady, pretty steady. And it’s really the newer protocols that come in at a lower rate. But I really want to keep in mind that we all have to take a look at what does that mean for incremental revenue, because that’s really what we are driving for. So, I just wanted to sort of close out with thinking about that in those terms.
Chris O’Brien: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask Chris, about the rollout of X-Pro into Europe? And to what extent do you think that will accelerate portfolio trading share? I mean I think you mentioned 92% of our PT has done in X-Pro now, I guess that’s mostly U.S. But how do you think that could influence – the rollout of X-Pro could influence the usage of PT on your platform in Europe. And if you – again, I asked this every once in a while, but if you had to guess sort of where you think that 11% market share of PT goes to in the next couple of years, what would you guess?
Chris Concannon: Great question, Brian. Thanks for that question. First of all, taking a step back, X-Pro is part of our technology migration. It’s an important part of that migration as we move to modern tech in the cloud with high levels of capacity and more importantly, the ability to enhance and add data to our platform for our clients, that’s a critical ingredient. As I mentioned earlier, it’s where all the demand is coming from our clients is not just workflow but data and analytics that help them improve their execution outcome. The other nice feature about X-Pro is the delivery schedule of X-Pro is much faster. Our ability to roll out new functionality, new data and analytics comes faster in that new tech. And that’s why it’s such an important ingredient to our tech migration globally. In X-Pro and in particular, the rollout in Europe, which will be exciting because while we have been making gains in both Eurobonds as well as emerging markets, which is largely traded from the European region, having X-Pro add to those gains, we think is fairly exciting. As you note, our X-Pro users are growing their PT volumes. And so with the delivery of X-Pro to Europe and onward to EM, we are excited that, that portfolio trading market share that we are garnering here in IG and high yield will continue to grow into those markets as well. But just because the workflow is easier, the integration of data and analytics to help portfolio trading is much easier, and there is lots of enhancements that we can do in the coming months and quarters ahead. So, we are excited about that rollout and excited about how fast we can deliver once that rollout is in place. That’s really the key ingredient. As clients ask us to make changes to functionality, it’s much easier and much faster to deliver in that new tech. With regard to my predictions on portfolio trading, it’s going to be a key ingredient to clients’ ability to leverage liquidity in the market. We are seeing more dealers entering the portfolio trading counterparty space. I think if you look at high yield and the performance portfolio trading had in the volatility of April, that’s a market share that I probably wouldn’t have predicted, which is 15% of the overall market, but it’s encouraging that clients are able to leverage that tool and achieve liquidity levels that we haven’t seen in this market in the past. And it’s really all about putting a basket together and having a dealer offset that with the liquidity in the ETF market. The other piece that’s important to the growth of portfolio trading is, we are seeing the growth of credit futures. We are partnered with MSCI on a credit future listed on ICE Futures. So, we are excited about that. That will lead to higher levels of turnover in the fixed income market, the successful launch of credit futures as well as the growth of ETFs. These are all levers that market makers use to hedge large portfolios and large RFQ lists as well. So, these are all – the trends are all in the right direction for growing portfolio trading in the U.S. market as well as in the European and EM market. Hopefully, that answers your question.
Brian Bedell: Yes. That’s great color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. I would now like to hand the call back over to Chris Concannon for final remarks.
Chris Concannon: Thanks everyone for joining us today. And we are looking forward to the quarter ahead, and we will talk to you again on the next quarterly call. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you for attending today’s call. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on February 06, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Davidson: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update; Rich Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on our trading businesses; and then Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2023. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Concannon: Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. Before I provide my strategic update, I would like to welcome Roberto Hoornweg to our Board of Directors effective March 1, 2025. Roberto’s wealth of experience in fixed income and international markets will be integral to our continued global expansion. Now turning to Slide 3 of my strategic update. We reported solid financial results for the year with 9% growth in revenue, our strongest annual revenue growth rate since 2020, with record commission revenue and record services revenue. In 2024, we also made solid progress with our high-touch strategy focused on meeting both the portfolio trading and block trading needs of our clients. We generated record levels of portfolio trading ADV in 2024 with record levels of U.S. high-grade portfolio trading estimated market share. Building on our focus on blocks during the year, we launched our block trading solution late in Q4 in emerging markets and Eurobonds, and we will be rolling out our full high-touch block solution in U.S. credit at the end of Q1 this year. To be clear, 2024 was a build year, and now 2025 will be a year of delivery and execution. We will be highly focused on growing our market share across our leading client-initiated channel, the portfolio trading channel and the dealer initiated channel. And we plan to regularly report back on our progress in each of these channels. Slide 4 illustrates the record levels of credit and rates ADV we delivered in 2024. In credit, we generated a record $712 million in commission revenue and record commission revenue across most product areas on record total credit ADV. We have maintained our leadership position in client-initiated RFQ in U.S. credit, while growing across our other product areas in emerging markets, Eurobonds, munis and rates. Our challenge was U.S. credit market share across key protocols. I will walk you through how our enhanced functionality differentiated data and innovative client solutions are expected to drive increased revenue and market share in 2025. Turning to our rates business. We have been very pleased with our growth in 2024. Trading ADV and our client-focused rates pool increased significantly from $2.9 billion per day in first Q 2024 to $11.4 billion ADV in Q4. A lot of this growth was driven by more clients leveraging our rates algos, which they use to work larger block orders with low market impact over a specific time range. In 2025, we expect to see more usage of our client algos as we migrate clients to Pragma technology launching in Q1. Slide 5 illustrates the strong progress we have made with our high-touch block strategy. First, in terms of portfolio trading, we gained over 200 basis points in share in U.S. high-grade portfolio trading in 2024, while we rolled out our new X-Pro platform and delivered portfolio trading tools in emerging markets, Eurobonds and munis. In the fourth quarter, with the launch of our Global PT offering, portfolio trading in Eurobonds doubled to approximately $11 billion in volume compared to 3Q 2024. In emerging markets, our portfolio trading ADV was up 175% for the full year 2024 versus 2023. I’m pleased to report that we did over $400 million in portfolio trading volume in munis in 2024. Turning to our high-touch block solution. During 2024, we continued our investment in our block trading solution, and now we are seeing early signs of progress. Since our launch in emerging markets in late November, we’ve done over $0.5 billion in block trades with over 75% of trades won by dealers recommended by our proprietary free trade selection tool that win rate substantially reduces information leakage on our platform. The feedback from clients and dealers is very positive as we expand our pre-trade analytics and block solutions into Eurobond and U.S. credit in Q1 2025. Before I discuss the expected drivers of our growth in 2025, we released our January trading metrics yesterday, which reflect continued elevated market volumes and disappointing U.S. high-grade market share. We have always guided investors to look at longer-term trends and not read too much into the month-over-month fluctuations in our market share as we experienced in January. During the month of January, we saw continued spread tightening and low spread volatility. We also saw a sizable jump in block volumes in the market and a drop in non-block volumes. Both factors have an impact on our high-grade market share, but they make us even more focused on solving the block trading solution for our clients. We have a clear strategy to return to market share growth in U.S. credit across our three channels, and we believe that we will begin to see the benefits of our investments and acquisitions in 2025 which I will now walk you through on the next slide. Slide 6 highlights the enhanced functionality, differentiated data and innovative client solutions that we expect to drive growth in 2025. As I mentioned earlier, our key initiatives are focused on these three channels. The client-initiated channel, where we have a clear leadership position in smaller-sized trades, and are focused on increasing our block share. The portfolio trading channel, we are very excited that we just launched our global benchmark portfolio trading solution, we also saw a pickup in high-yield portfolio trading market share in January. In the dealer initiative channel, where we have been in the process of enhancing our dealer solutions. Slide 7 lays out the key deliverables for 2025 as we realize the benefits of our investments, tech modernization and acquisitions. First, in the client-initiated channel, with our high touch solution, we are focused on the global rollout of our block trading solution, which began in EM in December. Eurobonds have launched in this quarter, and we are on target to launch our high-touch block trading in the first half of this year. With our low-touch solutions, we’re expanding our automation suite with products like Adaptive Auto-X to support our global product set and integrate our client algo solutions with key markets like ICE bonds. In terms of X-Pro, our goal is to roll out traditional RFQ on X-Pro in Europe in the first half of 2025 while expanding our high-touch and portfolio trading tools in the U.S. Next, in the portfolio trading channel, we’re expecting a full rollout of global benchmark pricing for portfolio trading, and we will continue to enhance our offering. And last in the dealer-initiated channel, dealer RFQ is expected to benefit from the migration to for X-Pro dealers, and we are looking to relaunch Mid-X to Pragma technology, both in the first half of 2025. Our expectation is that the client initiative and portfolio trading channels will be feature complete in the first half of 2025 and the enhancements for our dealer initiative channel will be launched and available to dealers in Q2. Slide 8 frames the U.S. high-grade market opportunity and the market channels that we are attacking to grow our share. First, the client initiative channel is an estimated $690 million revenue opportunity. representing approximately 63% of the total estimated e-trading opportunity in U.S. high grade. This is where we have a clear leadership position and have very high share in small-sized trades. Blocks made up 39% of the market at the end of 2024 and electronic penetration is very low. This is the most exciting opportunity in the market for us, and we are already seeing positive trends. Next is the portfolio trading channel, which is important from a market share perspective, but smaller from a revenue perspective. X-Pro and the pre-trade analytics that fuel X-Pro, have been integral to our share gains in portfolio trading. Last is the dealer-initiated channel which is also attractive, representing approximately $310 million or 28% of the TAM. We are attacking this channel with our dealer RFQ, our automation for dealers, Mid-X, and live market protocols, supported by our data and our new X-Pro for dealers. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our trading businesses.
Rich Schiffman: Thanks, Chris. On Slide 10, we highlight the key performance indicators for our trading businesses across channels for full year 2024. As this slide clearly shows, with the exception of U.S. credit market share, the key performance indicators across our platform are largely green in 2024, reflecting the underlying fundamental strength of our business. And as Chris highlighted, we have a comprehensive plan and are laser focused to address our U.S. credit market challenges. First, across our client-initiated channel, we generated record U.S. credit ADV, up 10% to $8 billion. We saw strong growth in international product ADV to a record $5 billion up 17%. The EM local markets are the largest opportunity in EM from an addressable market perspective. We produced record local markets ADV of over $1.4 billion, up 18%. Our performance in municipal bonds is a positive example of our product diversification strategy with record ADV up 22% and record estimated market share of 7%, up from 6% in the prior year. We are very pleased with the liquidity coming from our partnership with ICE bonds. This started with municipals and is now expanded to U.S. high-yield and price-based U.S. investment grade. ICE is becoming a valuable, micro-lot liquidity provider in U.S. corporate open trading. We experienced another quarter of strong growth in automation with record trade volume of $378 billion, up 25%. We had 245 active automation clients in 2024, 75 clients are now enabled for our algos, up from 13 in the prior year. Open Trading ADV was a record $4 billion in 2024, an increase of 8%. Open Trading continues to be the largest, single source of secondary liquidity in the U.S. credit markets, driven by our diverse liquidity pool. Our share of blocks in U.S. high grade was just over 11%, up slightly from 2023. In the portfolio trading channel, we generated record total PT ADV of over $900 million and record U.S. credit PT ADV of $800 million with record market share of 16%. Last, in the dealer-initiated channel, dealer RFQ and Mid-X ADV was a record $1.3 billion, representing a 17% increase over the prior year. While we are in the early innings of our expanded dealer services strategy, we are encouraged by the improvement we are seeing in Mid-X activity in Europe. Now let me turn the call over to Ilene to review our financial performance.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Thank you, Rich. Turning to our results, on Slide 12, we provide a summary of our fourth quarter financials. We delivered total revenue of $202 million, compared to $197 million in the prior year. Looking at each of our revenue lines in turn, commission revenue increased 2%, largely driven by increased market volumes, partially offset by lower market share. Information Services revenue of $13 million was up 10% and included a $300,000 benefit from FX. The increase was driven by new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+. Post-Trade Services revenue of $11 million was flat versus the prior year and included a $200,000 benefit from FX. The prior year period included over $1 million in onetime resubmission revenue. Technology Services revenue of $4 million increased 41%, driven by higher Pragma related license fees. Total other income decreased approximately $2 million due principally to mark-to-market losses on our U.S. treasury portfolio in the current quarter of approximately $2 million versus a gain of $1 million in the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 23%, and we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.73. On Slide 13, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue was $175 million compared to $172 million in the prior year. Strong growth in credit commission revenue across emerging markets up 18%, Eurobonds up 10% and municipals, up 6%, was partially offset by a 19% decline in U.S. high yield and lower levels of credit spread volatility. The reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product mix specifically lower high-yield activity. Total credit fee capture was in line with 3Q 2024 levels. The decline in fixed distribution fees was principally driven by dealer migrations to variable fee plans. On Slide 14, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $122 million increased 2% compared to the prior year as we anniversary the Pragma acquisition. Higher employee comp and benefits, tech and communications and marketing costs were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization, professional and consulting and general and administrative costs. Headcount was up 1%. On Slide 15, we provide an update on our capital management and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with cash, cash equivalents and corporate bonds and U.S. treasury investments totaling $699 million as of December 31 up from $602 million at the end of last year. We generated $328 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, an increase of 6% over last quarter. For the full year 2024, we repurchased 341,000 shares for a total of $75 million, including 64,000 shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $16 million. As of January 31, 2025, $220 million remains on the current authorization. We believe we are striking the right balance of investing to drive future growth, while at the same time being disciplined stewards of capital. On Slide 16, we provide you with our full year 2025 guidance. Total services revenue, which includes information, post trade and technology services is expected to grow in the mid single-digits in 2025. We expect total expenses to be in the range of $505 million to $525 million, off a base of $476 million in 2024. This would imply a growth rate of approximately 8% to the midpoint of the 2025 range. This includes the full year effect of 2024 hires, inflationary increases as well as tech investments and higher variable costs. We expect that the effective tax rate will be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $65 million to $70 million of which roughly 80% relates to capitalized software development costs for the investments we are making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Ilene. In summary, on Slide 17, we delivered solid financial results in 2024. In 2024, we made solid progress building our portfolio trading tools, our high-touch block training solution and our dealer solutions. Our focus in 2025 is now on realizing the benefit of our investments and the acquisitions and delivering those solutions across all three of our channels. 2025 is a year of delivery, and we look forward to reporting on the progress through the coming quarters. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] With that, your first question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Chris Allen: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk about the block trading launch in the U.S. I’m kind of curious why you led with emerging markets, Eurobonds first. When we think about the block trading launch, which we’ve been anticipated in the U.S., just how integral is having the deals on board for success on block penetration moving forward? And what steps you’re taking to ensure that success?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Thanks, Chris. And yes, pretty excited about both where we are from a block trading perspective and obviously, very excited about the launch, the pending launch in the U.S. I’ve been talking about our high-touch solution for quite some time. So it was great to see it launched in December of last year. We targeted – what we did is targeted EM and then Eurobonds, first, largely because of the pre-trade analytics that we have in both those markets from a great inventory of dealer axes. We also have pre-trade analytics that we call Smart Dealer Select. And then here in the U.S., we have AI dealer select tools. So it’s really when we looked at and added up all the pre-trade analytics, we were very excited about what we were seeing in EM in particular. And obviously, the clients in EM have been asking for a block solution for some time. So it was really the right market to launch in and we have seen in the fourth quarter, we did see our EM block market share increase. Blocks in EM increased by about 22%, as I mentioned in our opening remarks. The key ingredient to trading blocks, just taking a step back and look, we spent a lot of time looking at the electronic market and what their clients want solved. The big challenge for block trading is information leakage. In our bond market, you have to present your interest in an RFQ to get a price back. And so when you’re trading a block, you do not want to share that information broadly because of the impact it can have on the market. So that makes all-to-all less attractive for a block, and we’ve seen that over the years around our block market share for all-to-all. In a liquid market, clients choose all-to-all quite regularly, and we see that in our block trading stats in our all-to-all market. But what our client wants to do is target a specific dealer with a block, and they want a short list of dealers that they want to target – so they reduced that information leakage. The most important point and this is what we’re seeing the success in our tool is, they want to know that, that dealer has a high likelihood to respond and execute at a fair price. And so more information than just whether a dealer is act or showing a price or an indicative price is a key ingredient. So data matters when it comes to block trading. And so on an electronic platform, there’s more data that we can present as we present the pre-trade analytics. And we’re seeing in our block trading tool, very high hit rates relative to the traditional RFQ, we’re seeing about a 90% hit rate in our Eurobond targeted block trading tool, based on our Axess and our Smart Dealer Selection. So that’s an exceptionally high hit rate, where in traditional RFQ, it’s closer to 60% to 70% hit rate. And we are – it’s still early days. We have about 65 active clients using our block trading tool. And more importantly, just in – we launched it in December, we’ve just done as of yesterday, over $1.2 billion in volume in our targeted block trade solution. So still early days, but very excited about, one, the volumes that are going through, but more importantly, the experience that the clients are having in that tool. What our clients are asking for is what we call one click trading. They want to see a price, they want to share their information with a small list of dealers and they want to know that they’ll get a response, high likelihood of a response. And that’s really the feedback that we’re getting with that block trading tool. We will be launching here in the U.S. in U.S. high grade and U.S. high yield, the block solution, what I’ll call it enhanced block solution at the beginning of Q2 and we will have that very direct-to-dealer solution where you can one click with a dealer. Getting to your second part of your question, sorry, this is a long-winded answer because it’s an exciting topic for us. But the second part of your question is about how do dealers perceive this and what’s the reception from dealers, the dealers have been very supportive of us putting them in comp with a shorter list for clients. That’s an important ingredient because dealers pay a price of broad dissemination of an inquiry like in all-to-all. It’s called winner’s curse. The whole market knows that you’ve just taken a position, so when it comes to being a counterparty for a block, they like to know that there’s a shorter list or even one their own on that targeted inquiry. And they tend to price aggressively based on the number of people that are seeing that inquiry. And so that’s an important component. It’s actually dealer-friendly this block trading solution. And so the feedback from dealers has been positive, and the feedback from clients have been very positive.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. I wanted to just follow-up on a lot of your prepared remarks around kind of goals this year and improving market share. And I assume your first answer you hit some of this, but what gives you confidence in terms of the ability to grow share in high grade and you are rolling out products, but curious if you think the protocols you have today are what is going to drive that? Or what is still on the come? Do you think that is going to be the driver of that increased market share?
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Dan. First, I’ll start from a macro market perspective, the market itself is quite favorable to the fixed income market broadly where yields currently stand. Inflows into fixed income funds are generally positive, and they continue to be positive here in – just in January. So from a macro perspective, the market is still fairly attractive. New issue market is quite robust. We saw a heavy new issue market in January, and most forecasts predict a strong new issue market throughout the year of 2025. The other pieces of the puzzle turnover in the market continues to be at high rates of turnover similar to what we saw in 2024, so the velocity of the market. And I think in IG in particular, it’s largely driven by electronic trading, portfolio trading solutions the growth of electronic RFQ continues to drive that velocity of trading. The other piece is a very robust entry from systematic funds into the market, both as takers of liquidity, but also as alternative liquidity providers. That’s a key ingredient to our growth and overall growth of the velocity of trading in the bond market. The factors that are a struggle for our model, our RFQ model with an all-to-all solution have been very low volatility and very tight spreads. All to all is a great provider of alternative liquidity in high vol. And so the key for our growth rates in 2025 is being – is offering multiple protocols that are appropriate in multiple types of market environments. So as you think about it, we are the largest liquidity solution, alternative liquidity solution, electronic alternative liquidity solution in the U.S. credit market. Our platform provides an electronic RFQ for small sizes. We have an exceptionally strong automation solution for what I’d call no-touch trading. So our all-to-all market solves both no touch and low touch trading. And we’re now near the edges of completing our PT solution. I think I used in my prepared remarks feature complete in Q1 for portfolio trading. That doesn’t mean there won’t be an endless supply of new analytics and new functionality that clients will ask for in PT but we have a sizable feature rollout in Q1. We just had a release in Q in January. We have another release in February just next week, and we just see ourselves as being – having a highly competitive offering in portfolio trading in Q1. The other area of growth that we’re very excited about, I just talked about it with Chris Allen’s question, our block trading solution is finally launching in U.S. high grade, where it’s quite appropriate, what’s exciting about that is we’re targeting what I call the next 50% of the market. If you really think about it, that tool targets a bigger portion of the market than all of electronic trading in the high-grade market today. That’s just a huge opportunity for us to solve. And while it’s still early days, the evidence that we’re seeing on our block trading tool in both EM and EU is quite exciting around our launch in high grade. So look, January was not – that was a disappointing market share for us in January. And when we look at the rest of the year, we’re quite excited about the schedule. And as you can see in our prepared remarks, we’re quite regimented about dates and being committed to those dates of execution and delivery in 2025. So we’re quite confident about our rollout strategy across the U.S. corporate market. And the last piece that we are introducing a new product in – continuously in 2025 is the dealer business. The dealer-to-dealer business in U.S. high grade is about 30% of the market, 29% to be exact in January. That’s a sizable portion of the business. We expect that portion of the business continue to grow. As dealers turn over inventory at a much higher rate in the market to come. As we mentioned in the remarks, we already have a robust Dealer RFQ platform. That, in fact, saw market share gains, both in high grade and high yield in January, but we’re rolling out a Mid-X or a mid-market matching solution in Q2 and we’re rolling out a new front-end X-Pro for dealers starting in Q2 and rolling out throughout Q3. So we have a number of product deliveries rolling out through the first half of 2025. Each of those product deliveries, we intend to have market share impact as a result.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Budish: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Chris, you kind of touched on what I wanted to ask you about, which was sort of a higher-level look at the market in terms of where there’s room left to electronify. But I’ll kind of ask it anyway. You’ve always said historically that the key competitors, the phone. I guess, as you think about the block market, I think that’s largely unelectronified side, but I’m curious where else do you think there is low-hanging fruit parts of the market that are electronified but maybe not all the way? And how important – or how would you describe sort of what’s necessary in terms of either – is it either a matter of competition? Is it a matter of increasing electronification. How do you think about like which of those two is sort of more important as you think about growing your share over the next few years? Thank you.
Chris Concannon: Yes. Great question, one that we spend a lot of time on. If you think about our investment in 2024, we made a strategic decision to continue to invest in our high-touch block solution. While we knew we were facing competition in portfolio trading. But as we laid out in the TAM presentation, obviously, the block part of the market is by far the largest part that is not electronic. And it’s really phone and ID that we see the blocks flowing through. And when you look at the workflow over ID or phone, it’s just – it’s very inefficient and our clients continuously are looking for better ways to trade blocks, but in what I call a replicated fashion to phone and chat. They don’t want information leakage over the electronic platform, and that’s really what we perfected in our targeted flock training solution. The other areas of opportunity is really around the retail space, and it’s across U.S. corporates and across really the whole fixed income market. We have a platform that is targeting the private bank market called Access IQ. It continues to deliver volumes and growth month-over-month and obviously, year-over-year. So we’re encouraged that we have now tapped into the private bank space in the U.S. That was largely targeting European private banks and APAC Private Bank. So we’re seeing healthy growth from the retail market. I think with the rates being so attractive, more broadly, you’re going to continue to see higher levels of activity in the retail space. And then other areas, really the – I think the biggest area of electronic opportunity – an electronic evolution is really in emerging markets. It’s hard to get the true denominator in emerging markets, the full total market size, but it’s equivalent to the total size of U.S. investment grade in U.S. high yield. So it’s a sizable market. And by our estimates, we’re only looking at under 5% is electronically penetrated. So there’s a huge opportunity within the EM market. And the most important ingredient to all these electronic solutions is really around data. You can’t really electronify a market, absent the data and as we grow our footprint across the market, our data footprint and our data intelligence becomes that much more valuable. And that’s the most important ingredient. The more you touch the better your data becomes. And we’re rolling out data products in the same pace in which we’re rolling out these new protocols. So when you really see the complete offering by mid this year, we were going to be touching the largest trade sizes, portfolio trades, and those are complicated with lots of line items. The next largest, which is block trades, we’ll have protocol for that. We’ll have our current highly liquid, low touch all-to-all protocol and then full automation suite, both auto RFQ, but more importantly, algos that replicate multiple trades through RFQ and other ways to trade. So it will be a complete offering in 2025, and we spent the full year of 2024 investing and building out the ability to deliver all these products in 2025.
Rich Schiffman: Hey, Ben. It’s Rich. Just one thing I wanted to add to Chris’ remarks on this. And he highlighted all of the areas where electronic trading is, let’s say, not as well penetrated like the block area, for example. But one thing we definitely believe in is that even in the odd lot space, let’s say, the smaller-sized trades, this is going to continue to grow this segment. And just like what has happened in equities with all of the electronic trading adoption and the systematic liquidity providers that are out there are enabling new strategies for people to get in and out of bonds a lot more easily. It’s going to lead to more turnover in that size range is our view. And we believe we’ve got the right solutions to capture that flow. So we expect it to keep growing. I mean, we were just commenting before the call, we’ve seen a couple of trace days of $44 billion in high grade, which is well above the running averages. There’s a likelihood of increasing activity that’s going on in the sweet spot, which means more volume for us to capture.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe if I could just ask a bigger picture question on the high-yield business. January market share near 12%. I think two years ago, you were in the kind of 17% to 18% range. I know there’s been a number of changes with the market. There’s been cyclical headwinds, maybe some structural headwinds as well. But if you look at market share by client type in high yield, I’m just trying to understand where you’re seeing good progress over the past two years, which client segments are still seeing some good growth? And then where are you seeing the most pullback or share migrate away or clients just pull back from the marketplace as we’re trying to think about the growth trajectory and share from here?
Chris Concannon: Yes. Great question. High yield in 2024, the market itself from a macro perspective certainly saw challenges for end investors, very attractive markets, spreads were tight, volatility was low. For ETF market makers, anyone trading ETF arbitrage that’s a very difficult market to trade in, particularly as the borrower rate went up sizably in 2024. So being able to put on an arbitrage across the high-yield market became quite difficult. So really what we saw in 2024 and still in January is the ETF players, those that were trading high yield on an ETF R really exit the market. We saw some trading pads at some of the hedge funds closed down. We still see – we continue to see systematics coming into high yield because they want to make the investment to be there most systematics that we talk to that are investing in the high-yield product and high-yield trading continue to be that volatility will return to the high-yield market. Certainly, if you have any credit challenges through high yield, we see individual issuer volatility snap back but they’re really predicting that there will be vol eventually back in high yield, and that spread will widen out and so they’ll have opportunity for the arbitrage, they’ll have opportunity for just straight dealer solutions. When it comes to high yield and the traditional buy side, from a macro perspective, high yield is still very attractive. That rate environment is very attractive. So we continue to see inflows into the high-yield funds. And really, portfolio trading is picking up in high yield. We’ve seen it come up to about 8% of the high-yield market. And we recently launched our benchmark portfolio trading tool, which we tend to see more benchmark trades in high yield. So we did pick up portfolio trading market share did increase in January, which was encouraging. Not to talk about high-touch block trading again, but we do hear from our clients that they’re very sensitive to information leakage in high yield in particular. The block trade sizes are smaller. They’re probably around $3 million is considered a block trade in a more liquid high-yield bond. So the block trading solution will be welcomed by most high-yield traders just because it’s targeting either a single dealer or a small list of dealers. And if the hit rates continue at those high levels, that’s one of the biggest challenges in high yield is just maintaining a high hit rate based on your inquiries.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Blostein: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the questions as well. Lots of great color. I really appreciate the TAM analysis as well. I know it’s going to be a hard question to answer, but I guess we’ll try anyway. So 2024 big build-out year, 2025 you expect to see the benefits of that. How would you define success in terms of market share accomplishments in 2025 when it comes to high grade and high yield within the U.S.? And I guess what are the kind of top one or two protocols that you’re pushing forward? You named a lot of things that you think will help you recoup some of that market share and then ultimately, the implications and fee per million all else constant. And I know that the mix and macro could impact that. Just kind of trying to get a sense of what the revenue implication from these efforts could ultimately be given that things like portfolio trading, et cetera, come with a much lower fee per million? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Okay. Let me simplify your question, you want us to predict our market share and our overall revenue for 2025. What I think – what I will do is let me go through the protocols individually because each one certainly could have sizable impacts on share and obviously sizable impacts on revenue. Obviously, I’ll start with portfolio trading because it’s obviously been a very focused area of ours and certainly continues to focus in Q1. It has sizable market share impacts. And we’ve seen this, and we’ve predicted this in the last quarter call, you can see swings of market share for platforms that offer portfolio trading. We see it in our own market. There are sizable portfolio trades that come to market. In January, we saw actually very low level of what we call mega portfolio trades. Anything of $1 billion-plus in size. There was just a smaller number of those mega PTs in the market. Whereas in December, there was a lot more of those mega trade. So from a share perspective, not a revenue perspective because we showed you the TAM around PT, you can really move and swing market share around based on portfolio trading tools. And we’re very excited where we think we’ll be just in Q1 with the next few releases on our portfolio trading tool. Moving to the block side. I spent a lot of time talking about high touch and blocks, but that has a sizable impact on share and obviously, revenue it has very attractive fee schedule. It’s not like a PT. It has certainly more consistent with traditional RFQ fee schedule. But it does have larger trade sizes, so fee capture is quite attractive. But again, it doesn’t – it doesn’t involve at all. So it has a slightly different fee capture to an all-to-all. To the extent there’s higher levels of volatility. And certainly, we’ve seen momentary spikes of volatility with the announcements coming fast and furious out of the new administration. To the extent there is volatility, we would expect our all-to-all platform to pick up rapidly, similar to what we saw just this week with the spike in activity around the tariff news that came out over the weekend. So all-to-all is really a great protocol for smaller sizes for automation, for traditional RFQ and we obviously have the largest RFQ network in U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield for that all-to-all platform. But again, with volatility spiking, we can see share movement around that all-to-all platform. The last piece is obviously automation. We continue to see clients ask for more sophisticated levels of automation. Just in 2024, our automation volume grew by 29% year-over-year. And in the fourth quarter, it was up 21%. And so we continue to see that demand. In January, we continue to grow our automation volume. It grew 23% year-over-year in January. So that automation suite is in high demand. And one of the areas that is a sweet spot is in the clients that are offering large SMA solutions. They’re getting smaller trade sizes through that SMA channel of their business. And so they’re adopting automation quite rapidly. Our automation suite is just touching 245 active clients recently, and that’s out of our over 2,000 clients around the globe. So the penetration across our client base is still low relative to the global client base, but the demand for automation continues to grow. And if you follow the projections for SMA growth alone, it’s projected to grow up to $5 trillion from the, call it, current $2 trillion. That’s obviously a great area of growth for us in the fixed income markets as those grow, the demand for automation will grow. So, I covered all of our protocols. The nice thing is, we feel like we’re going to be in a great spot in terms of offering multiple protocols to our clients all designed for different elements of the market and all designed for different environments to trade through in the market.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: So Alex, let me take the fee per million part of your question. And if you think about sort of the four key protocols that Chris talked about, there are puts and takes in terms of fee per million there, right? But again, this is about sort of driving share, driving revenue and thinking about the future. And Chris talked about portfolio trading. He talked about blocks. We know that those come in at a bit lower fees per million. And then you talked about Open Trading and automation, which we now come in at a bit higher fees per million, right? So there’s puts and takes there. But let’s take a step back and think about, for instance, what the largest driver in the change of fees per million was just in January. And we know that in high grade, that’s duration, and it was duration. And if you think about it, right, we saw in January that weighted average years to maturity was call it, eight point – call it two, eight years versus nine, a little over nine last year, and that was also down from, call it, 8.9 almost nine in December. So that was a pretty big driver of what happened. We also saw yields go up in this past January to over 5%. And if you think about that, that’s another headwind that we saw in the duration calculation. So now let’s think about how quickly trading behavior can change and what that could mean for duration. We know that, that can happen. And we’ve actually even seen it already in just the first few days of February, now the first few days of February does not make a year needless to say. But I think we have to really keep in mind how much duration does impact these types of things. And so when you think about fees per million, you think about duration and high grade, this is obviously a key component. But if I take a step back, and I know it’s really people are trying to model this and I get it, and I know how important it is, the average fees per million across most of our credit products really has been quite stable in terms of our fee card over the past few years, right? And I just want to remind us of that. And there are all these puts and takes that we’ve talked about. And so if you think about the puts and takes, and I just mentioned a few of them. I’ll go through them again just because I know there’s a lot here, but you’ve got the growth of PT even if you look at just what happened year-over-year, that 200 basis points that Rich talked about, we know that has a negative impact on fees per million, right? But we also know that if you think about – and I’ve talked about this on I think it our last call when I looked back over, call it, a five-year time period, and I said, okay, what was sort of the average of fees per million over that time period, and it was about $173 per million. And we know that, for instance, Chris just talked about high yield, and we were asked, well, what’s going on in the high-yield space. And then we know that, that also has a significant benefit and tailwind fees per million. So if we see our ETF market maker clients get more active, that could be an overall benefit as well. So if you think about that as a benefit possibility, if you think about if we see changes in duration and high grade as another benefit possibility, if you see more vol pick up. And again, we’ve got to see how this all works out, but that could create additional Open Trading, which is more of a premium product in terms of how you think about fees per million. So you just sort of how to think about all these different factors that go into fees per million. Now we do know that you also look at the macro environment. I would also say we’ve got to see that the Fed is – and what’s happening there in terms of the rate environment that’s changing day by day. So obviously, that also impacts trading activity. And so if you have sort of a more longer or call it elongated, if you think about how the curve is moving, that will take – if you think about how people look at their trading activity in the rate environment, whether or not they’ll go out longer on the curve, really, they’re going to look at what’s happening in the rate environment. And so all of these types of things we have to take into effect. And so – that’s kind of the puts and takes that I would say to keep in mind. I hope that is helpful when you think about fees per million in general.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jeff Schmitt: Hi, good morning. Portfolio trading as a percent of industry high-grade and high-yield activity, it’s been around 10% for the last probably six months at least. What do you think is driving that pause? And can you continue to drive share gains there even if it stays at these levels?
Chris Concannon: First from a macro perspective, if you look at volatility, if you look at spread and spread volatility in the fixed income market. It’s been quite attractive to get a portfolio trade done at an attractive price. We have seen in the past – again, we haven’t seen a lot of volatility, but it becomes more difficult to trade a large portfolio in higher levels of vol. And so at these levels of vol, I think the 10% range is quite an attractive range for portfolio trades. There also has been a number of portfolio trading counterparties that have moved in and out of the market. So profitability for the dealer around portfolio trading has been up and down. And in low vol, it’s probably a little bit more attractive and higher vol becomes more difficult to manage that large inventory that you’re taking down a portfolio trade. It is capital-intensive trade for a dealer. So they obviously – we obviously see large banks that have the capital are highly engaged in portfolio trading. It is a tool that the buy side finds attractive to move flows and it will be around. It’s not going anywhere. I think the market environment and capital willingness will really dictate where portfolio trading moves in the market from quarter-to-quarter from year-to-year. Because it is a trading tool that will be around for a long time. With regard to our share in portfolio trading, we continue to grow our portfolio trading just in investment grade last year. We obviously grew overall notional portfolio trading by 80%. So we are encouraged with our performance but not where we need to be. So we’re excited about what’s happening with new features rolling out this quarter. We do think it will have an impact on our competitiveness in the portfolio trading space. Portfolio trades are getting bigger. Not smaller. So the number of line items that we’re seeing over 1,000 line items is becoming a common place for portfolio trades. And so we expect that market to continue to move in and around that 10%. At these levels of volatility, you could see it move up certainly into the teens. But we expect it to be around that part of the market for some time to come. It is a very valuable tool for the buy side to move in and out of flow quite quickly and aggressively. And the prices that we’re seeing in the market are relatively attractive for the end investor and where the buy side is getting executed in that market. That could change if volatility comes into the market, obviously. And that’s why we’re so focused on having multiple protocols across our platform. So if you’re sitting at our trade desk, you can trade a PC, trade a block, trade below touch list or trade fully automated. That’s the key ingredient that we’re targeting in 2025.
Rich Schiffman: And Jeff, it’s Rich. I’ll just add to that. I mean there’s no question about the convenience of the PT trade and easy way to move a lot of line items. But one thing about it, it’s a pretty concentrated market in terms of the liquidity and you’re talking about it’s fairly dominated by six to eight, maybe kind of 10 firms. And that makes it not being really unique liquidity. So we’re really confident in our ability in terms of share, whatever the percentage of the market is going to be. And I mean maybe I’ll take the under on it a little bit there. But in terms of grabbing market share, it’s the same liquidity on the different venues. So as we continue to increase our capabilities and build in the analytics and build all the features that our clients are looking for, we feel that, that’s pretty easy volume to move. It’s quite different than the in comp business, where Open Trading in that area, that represents, let’s say, 35% was the Q4 number. And that comes from over 1,000 unique liquidity providers. That’s not easily replicated in other places, which makes the volume stickier keeping it with us. But we feel really confident about our ability to get increased share of the existing whatever percent of the market PT is going to be.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Eli Abboud with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Eli Abboud: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can you speak to your motivation behind acquiring the rest of RFQ hub and walk us through the materiality of the financial impact there? And then bigger picture, to what extent is it a priority for you to become more cross asset? Is that something you feel like clients are demanding?
Chris Concannon: Thanks for the question, Eli. Yes, we exceptionally excited about RFQ hub and the prospects for RFQ hub. It is a multi-asset platform. So there’s obviously ETFs. We’re very focused on the ETF market and the opportunity for block trading and ETFs through RFQ. That is a sizable market, both here in the U.S. as well as in Europe and throughout Asia. It is also a derivative platform. So it offers futures, equity derivatives, complex swaps and other derivatives. And that’s really where the platform started out first, particularly in the European OTC market. So it’s an exciting platform to have cross assets traded on the platform. It’s a very flexible market so we can add product quite easily. We think the important ingredient about having and where we see synergies is really being able to offer our large client base, fixed income client base access to fixed income ETF side by side. That is an important component. If you look at the growth of the portfolio trading market, every PT is really correlated to an ETF and so clients have a choice of trading directly the underlying bond in a PC or trading at ETF. And it’s really dependent on where that ETF NAV is trading in real time relative to the underlying portfolio. So there are choices that we can offer clients just through data and analytics around trading the PT itself or trading the ETF, which is correlated ETFs – fixed income ETFs are a great way for a portfolio manager to get instant exposure to the bond market. They’re highly liquid and can be traded in block form, so it’s just another tool in our fixed income protocol solutions that we want to offer our clients. So we’re excited about that transaction. Again, we already own 42% of RFQ hub through our partnership with Virtu. We have a number of the dealers invested in that platform as well. So there’s still continuous dealer support in the platform. And it’s bringing all those alternative products into the market access suite. And really the key synergy is our ability to redistribute what is a very successful small platform to our huge client network and our international presence across the institutional marketplace.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: And you guys probably know this, but you can see the equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliate rate on our consolidated statement of operations, and that’s really the RFQ has current that Chris just talked about in terms of the ownership. And that will obviously get consolidated into operating results once we bring that on. But that’s another way that you can look at it and think about sort of opportunity there.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just hoping to touch on the rates platform for a moment. The volumes are up very nicely there on a year-on-year basis but still a smaller contributor to revenues today. So can you just talk about some of the initiatives across your rates platform that you have in mind to further scale this part of the business. Talk about some of your ambitions here, how you see this contributing over time? And maybe you could also update us on the net spotting tool? What’s been sort of the uptake from customers? I know you’ve had this for a bit. Just how do you see that contributing as well to the broader platform?
Chris Concannon: Great. And thanks for asking about rates. It’s certainly a product that we love and certainly, we’ve seen growth in 2024 and a number of exciting things happening in that rate space. First, I do think we have to recognize that in the rates market, it’s really largely driven by electronic RFQ to the buy side. It’s been that way, traditional RFQ, typically RFQ to five dealers for many years. And so when it comes to innovation to the client side, we haven’t seen a lot of innovation in terms of interesting protocols or new tools. The rates RFQ platforms in the market have also enjoyed low levels of volatility. We’ve seen spikes of volatility, but the clients that we talk to in the rate space are quite concerned that they don’t have direct electronic access to alternative liquidity. Because when that market turns volatile it becomes a much more challenging market to trade, yet the alternative liquidity providers tend to provide more liquidity in those moments of volatility. And we’ve seen that on our platform and just traditional all-to-all in corporates. And so a key ingredient, we think to the rates market is making sure there’s a healthy interaction between clients, large dealers and ultimately all-to-all liquidity in times of need. Where we’ve been mostly innovative in our rate space is offering clients algo solutions that provide the client the ability to trade large-sized orders but in smaller size without market impact. So really being both passive liquidity providers or using smaller size orders to take liquidity through a systematic algorithm. I’m excited that we’re launching our algos just this month on Pragma, so we’re migrating our algo solution onto our Pragma platform in the rates market, which just gives us great tooling for clients and very interesting controls around the algo suite of products that we can offer. The other piece is our net hedging for rates has been in our corporate bond market for quite some time. We launched that a number of years ago. It continues to get bigger. We continue to see more and more clients adopt the net hedging solution. Again, it is client adopted. We don’t just turn it on for all clients. It’s a very powerful way for us to actually provide large banks with liquidity and rates. So we offer net hedging, and we offer hedging for dealers. So overall, the rates complex that you saw continues to grow and continues to grow here in January. So we’re excited about rates. We do plan on launching in 2025, our RFQ solution, which the client community is much more familiar with. So we want to have a hybrid offering where we’re offering both electronic algorithmic solutions as well as traditional RFQ solutions.
Operator: Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.
Simon Clinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I think most of my questions have been at and Chris, thanks so much for the detail and color a lot of really useful stuff I heard today. I just wanted to refer to Slide 19 in the bottom left, the relationship between fee per million and duration, which those obviously very sensitive. And I was just wondering if you could just talk about what kind of scenarios or what kind of macro conditions, we would need to see for the fee per million to go or at least the duration to go below the lows that we saw in September 2023 and thus take fee per million below where we are today. Just kind of curious as to what – I guess, how you’re thinking about are we – was the January number just like a bottom? Or is there still plenty of room for that to drop if conditions continue down as part.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Sure. Thanks for the question, Simon. So I mean, it’s always hard to call something a bottom at hot particularly when you’re dealing with trading behavior and when you’re talking about a rate environment and you’re talking about central banks making changes to economic policy. So I don’t think I want to go there. But I think what we need to look at and think about is where do we see the rate environment and how do we see trading behavior, right? Right now, we know that the most recent, I think, if we look at CME, Watch, FedWatch, right, the most recent call for rate cuts is, I want to say, one to two. Just a little while ago, it wasn’t so long ago that we saw three to four. And when you saw three to four as what people were calling for, you see folks wanting to trade out further on the curve. That’s pretty normal behavior if you see that type of a steepening. Now we’ve seen a bit of a bear steepener and it’s been quite unusual what you saw most recently, some would call it a bear steepener and that’s not what we would expect in a rate-cutting cycle. And so having said that, as I said most recently, with sort of different outcomes in terms of economic policy decisions, things changing quite rapidly. You’re also seeing, we saw just in the last few days, as I said before, change in behavior on duration. And just honestly, it went from quite quickly from, call it, eight years of weighted average years to maturity to 9% [ph]. Now I can’t tell you it’s staying there, but I can tell you that we saw a quite quick change in behavior. So you have to look at things like all the normal things you would think of bond traders looking at what’s happening with inflation, what’s happening in those numbers? How are we seeing what the Fed is saying there or in terms of where the rate environment is going to come out. And so all of these things matter. What do we think is going to happen in terms of will there be a soft landing? Will it take longer for the Fed to come down in rates. I mean, all of these things matter. But again, we really have to see what’s going to happen in the environment. We have to see where the yields are going to turn out as well because as you know, I mean we’ve talked about the sensitivity before. When you see a one year increase on the platform and weighted average years to maturity, that can be worth about $15 for us in high grade. And if you see yields come in 100 basis points, that can be worth $3 to $5, right? So all of this is – we’ve got to see what happens in the macro environment.
Chris Concannon: And Simon, I would just add, in our client to dealer space, obviously, as Ilene pointed out, there’s lots of factors to go into figuring out what that fee per million will come out – but really, the good news is from the client perspective, we spend more time focused on functionality, features, data and analytics and really don’t get concerns from clients around fee pressure. So from a market – broader market perspective, it’s really about delivering functionality to clients that they need to help them trade our fees are ultimately small features of the overall spread and cost of trading. So that fee pressure dialogue is just not present we don’t see fees as a weapon or a tool in the competitive marketplace. We really see rolling out functionality, new data and analytics is really the way to move share around.
Operator: Thank you. And that ends our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Chris Concannon for closing remarks.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, everyone, for joining us. As you heard in both our prepared remarks and our Q&A. We are laser focused on execution and delivery. We spent 2024 building product, and now we’re rolling out specific dates, specific time lines on delivering that product. So, we’re excited about 2025, and we’re excited about the product rollout that we put out in the public on this call. Thank you, and I look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on November 6, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Davidson: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer; will provide you with a strategic update. Rich Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on the performance of our markets, and then Ilene Cozelle Bieler, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Concannon: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. As announced earlier today, Rick McVey, our Founder and Executive Chairman; has informed our Board of Directors that he will be retiring from the Board at the end of the year to spend more time with his growing family and his philanthropic endeavors. Rick is a pioneer in the electronic trading arena and he is the reason why I came to MarketAxess. His vision, his innovation and his tenacity are why MarketAxess is the company it is today. Rick's years of fixed income experience has been an extraordinary resource for me and the Board. While Rick is retiring from the Board, we are very lucky to still have him as the Chairman of our International Board. I would also like to congratulate Carlos Hernandez on his appointment as our next Chairman of the Board. Carlos rejoined our Board in 2023 after concluding a highly distinguished career at J.P. Morgan. Throughout his career, Carlos has been passionate about electronic trading solutions and financial market structure. I am humbled by what Rick has built, and I'm looking forward to continuing his work with Carlos in his new role as Chairman. Now let's turn to the third quarter results. Turning to Slide 3 of my strategic update. We continue to execute our strategy this quarter and deliver 20% growth in revenue driven principally by strong growth in market volumes. We continue to be disciplined around our expense management, which helped to unlock the powerful operating leverage in our model and drove a 30% increase in diluted earnings per share. We released our October trading metrics yesterday, which reflects continued strong growth in market volumes year-over-year. We have always guided investors to look at the longer-term trends and not read too much into the month-to-month fluctuations in our market share as we experienced in October. We believe the decline in our U.S. high-grade market share was driven by lower portfolio trading and a client shift to large block trading in the market. As we have mentioned before, large portfolio trades in the market and changes in the mix of client activity can generate significant short-term swings in market share without materially impacting revenue generation. We have a clear strategy to return to market share growth in U.S. credit while we continue to deliver growth across the global fixed income market. We continue to enhance our global portfolio trading solution, and we are pleased with the early returns we are seeing in terms of market share gains. We have now launched the key elements of our targeted block trading capability to attack the highest value client order flow, representing 40% of the U.S. high-grade market. We are on track to deliver traditional RFQ on X-Pro to our European clients in the first quarter of 2025. Last, we continue to see momentum in our emerging market offering with a block trading solution rolling out to clients this quarter. We are pleased to announce a strategic fixed income data partnership with S&P Global last week. With this partnership, we are combining our CP+ market data with S&P's global evaluated bond pricing solution. Slide 4 highlights the power of our product and geographic diversification across global credit and rates, as illustrated by our strong third quarter trading data. Commission revenue generated outside of U.S. credit represented 37% of total commission revenue up from just 25% in first quarter of 2019. Our emerging markets franchise is a key growth cylinder of this powerful diversification story. Slide 5 provides more detail on the strength of our expanding emerging markets franchise. We are seeing strong growth in emerging markets trading activity across regions with record LatAm and APAC emerging markets trading volume up 51% and 30%, respectively. The EM local markets are the largest opportunity in EM from an addressable market perspective. One of our fastest-growing protocols in local markets is request for market or RFM which is helping to drive record levels of block trading in local markets. Dealer RFQ across hard and local currency is also showing strong growth, up 47%. We are very excited about the emerging market opportunity ahead of us, which we believe is still in very early stages of electronification. Slide 6 lays out our strategic priorities to grow market share. In terms of our high-touch strategy, we recently completed the initial rollout of our Global PT solution in Europe. And I'm also pleased to report that we just completed an update to X-Pro to create a more intuitive interface for clients focused on portfolio trading and our proprietary trading analytics. The client feedback has been strong. With record portfolio trading ADD in September, we delivered third quarter estimated market share of U.S. credit portfolio trading of 20%, several hundred basis points higher than second quarter levels. We believe that the investments we have made in our new platform that supports client portfolio trading, traditional RFQ and automation are beginning to pay dividends. In the coming months, we will begin the initial rollout of traditional RFQ on X-Pro to our European clients. While the initial focus of X-Pro and our high-touch strategy was portfolio trading, we are now leveraging the deep enriched content and pre-trade analytics we have in X-Pro for block trade sizes. This targeted solution for clients streamlines the transition of block size trays from phone and chat to electronic solution while reducing information leakage. The two key elements of our block strategy is our AI-driven dealer selection tool and our new proprietary data set, CP+ for blocks. Last, in the dealer-to-dealer segment, we are seeing green shoots in that important segment as we look to expand Auto-X for dealer RFQ to emerging markets, Eurobonds and munis. We generated 28% growth in dealer RFQ and an 11-fold increase in Mid-X in Eurobonds in the third quarter. Slide 7 highlights select macro factors that we believe indicate we are moving into a more constructive operating environment. The new issue calendar has been very robust in 2024 with U.S. high grade up 27% and U.S. high yield, up 86% year-to-date. The velocity of trading in U.S. high grade was above 80% in the third quarter with an exit rate of 91% in September. Yields have come down with the recent rate cuts but remain attractive. As a result, fund flows into high-grade ETFs and mutual funds are up 158% from the prior year. Fund flows have been one of the factors keeping credit spreads tight but we do believe that volatility should pick up in the coming months. Lastly, in advance of the rate cuts in September, client activity on the platform in high grade reflected an uptick in trading and higher duration bonds which benefited U.S. high-grade fee capture in the quarter. That client trend has continued into October as well. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our markets.
Rich Schiffman: Thanks, Chris. On Slide 9, we highlight the expansion of our trading business across geographies, products and workflows. We generated strong growth in international client trade volume and trade count in the third quarter. Trade volume was up 23% versus last year with a three-year CAGR of 17%, trade count was up 16% versus last year with a three-year CAGR of 24%. We are also seeing strong contributions from growing client segments, including hedge funds, systematic trading firms, dealers and private banks. We generated $254 billion in trading volume, up 41% from these important client segments, which now represents 28% of our total credit trading volume, up from 26%. Dealer-initiated trading volume, which includes dealer RFQ and Mid-X on this chart, was over $80 billion in the quarter, representing a 34% increase over the prior year and included an 11-fold increase in Eurobond's Mid-X trading volume. While we are in the early innings of our expanded dealer services strategy, we are encouraged by the improvement we are seeing in Mid-X activity in Europe. Access IQ, our order and execution workflow solution designed for wealth management and private banking clients, delivered a 32% increase in ADV year-over-year. We recently onboarded one of the largest U.S. banks to access IQ as we seek to grow our private banking business beyond Europe. We are also seeing strong product diversification in municipal bonds with record estimated market share of 8.7%, up from 5.8% in the prior year. We launched connectivity with ICE bonds, the first week of September for munis and then corporates a week later. The feedback we have received from clients has been very positive, and we believe ICE bonds complementary liquidity will support further market share growth. We are also very pleased with the growth of portfolio trading from munis, which we launched in the second quarter of '24. Year-to-date through October, we have executed over $500 million in trading volumes. Lastly, on munis, we are expecting to launch CP+ for munis in December, with full integration with our protocols in the first quarter of '25. Slide 10 provides an update on own trading, our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool. Open Trading ADV was $4 billion and share of total credit volume was 35%, up from 34% in the prior year. Open Trading generated record trade count up 27% from the prior year. Hedge fund trade activity has continued to expand on our platform with record ADV of $1.9 billion in the quarter up 57% from the prior year. A record 206 hedge funds provided liquidity through Open Trading in the quarter, a 2% increase from the prior year. The price improvement opportunity in Open Trading, as shown on the lower left side of this slide, ticked up in the quarter on slightly higher levels of credit spread volatility. Open Trading continues to be the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the U.S. credit markets, driven by our diverse liquidity pool. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown on Slide 11. We experienced another quarter of strong growth in automation trade volume and record trade count with three-year CAGRs of 31% and 40%, respectively, and a record 249 active automation client firms. Automation trade volume now represents 11% of our total credit volume and a record 27% of our total credit trade count. There were over 10 million algo responses from dealers, an increase of 24% year-over-year. We are increasingly leveraging the technology that we obtained through the Pragma acquisition with our entire automation suite moving into its tech stack which will allow us to launch the next generation of Auto-X based on Pragma algorithms. Our adaptive Auto-X provide Algo is a great example of a workflow that allows clients to respond to other clients and dealers RFQs, further supporting our Open Trading, all-to-all model. Now let me turn the call over to Ilene to review our financial performance.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Thank you, Rich. Turning to our results. On Slide 13, please provide a summary of our third quarter financials. We delivered revenue of $207 million, up 20% from the prior year. Strong top line growth driven by robust market volumes, combined with continued cost discipline, resulted in the first quarter of positive operating leverage since the fourth quarter of 2020, with incremental margins of approximately 60%. Looking at each of our revenue lines in turn. Commission revenue increased 20% on strong broad-based growth across most product areas, more than offsetting a decrease in U.S. high yield. Information Services revenue of $13 million was up 10% and included a $300,000 benefit from FX. The increase was driven by new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+. Health Trade Services revenue of $10 million was up 6% and included a $200,000 benefit from FX. Total other income increased approximately $1 million due principally to mark-to-market gains on our U.S. treasury portfolio. The effective tax rate was 23%, and we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.90 representing an increase of 30%. On Slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue was $180 million, representing an increase of $30 million or 20% for the quarter. The increase in credit commission revenue was due to strong growth across U.S. high grade of 24%, emerging markets, up 18%, Eurobond of 25% and municipals up 28%. The reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product and protoconics. Specifically, lower high-yield activity and increased portfolio trading. Total credit fee capture was slightly up from 2Q '24 levels. The decline in fixed distribution fees was driven principally by the consolidation of two global bank trading desk operations, migrations to variable fee plans and lower unused minimums in U.S. high grade. On Slide 15, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses of $120 million increased 14% compared to the prior year and include the impact of Pragma which we will anniversary in the fourth quarter. We saw higher-than-anticipated variable costs from increased trading activity as well as about 40% of the $10 million in additional expenses that were not previously included in the run rate from the first half of the year that I mentioned on the second quarter earnings call. As you know, there are always puts and takes that come through the expense line. And at this time, we expect some of our anticipated fixed expenses will shift to future periods. As such, we expect to absorb the increase in variable expenses within the original incremental $10 million, keeping in mind that variable costs can always change based on market conditions. So we expect our full year 2024 expenses to be more or less in line with our previous guidance of slightly below the low end of our range of $480 million to $500 million. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our capital management and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with cash, cash equivalents and corporate bond and U.S. treasury investments totaling $602 million as of September 30, up from $559 million at the end of last quarter. We generated $310 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, an increase of 4% over last quarter. We repurchased 297,000 shares year-to-date through October 2024 for a total of $64 million, including 66,000 shares repurchased during the third quarter at a cost of $15 million. $236 million remains under current authorization. We believe we are striking the right balance of investing to drive future growth, while at the same time being disciplined stewards of capital. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Ilene. In summary, on Slide 17, we continue to execute our growth strategy in the third quarter. We delivered significantly improved financial results driven by very strong market volumes, a robust new issue calendar and an increase in the velocity of trading are all contributing to a more constructive macro backdrop for us. We are continuing the rollout of X-Pro by extending the platform to our global client base and across most products, and we are executing our plan to grow market share. We are seeing early signs of success with portfolio trading and our dealer solutions product in Europe. The next phase is to extend share gains to block size trades in the U.S. credit market with the recent launch of our targeted block trade solution. Given the strong market volumes more constructive market backdrop and our focus on our strategic priorities, we believe we are well positioned to deliver continued growth in the coming quarters. Now we would be happy to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Allen of Citi. Your line is now open.
Chris Allen: Yes, morning everyone. First, I want to say congrats to Rick on the retirement. Hope you enjoy. Two, wanted to dive a little bit into October and block. October is the first month, I recall you calling out lower block activity is an impediment to share. And I noted that your block solution is now in the market. Can you provide some details on just in terms of what's the game plan and accelerating the penetration of the solution moving forward? And what is the current level of client uptake on the solution right now?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Great. Thanks, Chris, and happy to take that question. First, just putting October in perspective, we did have record overall volumes in the month of October. It was the first month that we crossed over $1 trillion in volume traded on the platform, which was quite exciting total credit volume, we set a record. We set records in our rates, average daily volumes. We set a record in emerging market volumes in October and we set a record in Eurobonds total volumes in October. So overall, when I look across the platform, very strong month. We also saw an increase in U.S. high-yield market share and as we reported an increase in U.S. high-grade fee capture. So a lot of good stories throughout the month of October. We did see in the overall market, a slight decline from September in portfolio trading across the overall market. I think that impacts not just us, but some of the other competitors in the space that have portfolio offerings. We do think that's a natural level that October delivered around 10% of the total market was portfolio trading. September was actually a spike up to that 13% level. So I think the 10% number right now is a more natural number that we'll see in the market. What was, as you mentioned, what was out of the norm that we haven't seen at these levels, overall block trading, so trades larger than $5 million in size increased pretty dramatically, up to close to 40% of the entire market. And that's up from August, it was somewhere around 36%. So it was a sizable move in overall block volume. I think we saw something similar to that in April of this year where we saw close to the same level, about 40% of trades. And we did experience a depressed high-grade market share during that period as well. And so the bad news is that those large blocks moved to the phone and to chat. The good news is that, that's the very market that we're attacking with the recent launch of our high-touch strategy in X-Pro. We refer to this as a targeted block trading solution and it was only launched just about two weeks ago. So it's still early days but it's the exact part of the market that we've been talking about targeting for some time. And we feel very good about the fact that we're on offense now and not playing defense anymore. We're going after the phone market. It's a powerful part of the market. It can be anywhere from 30% to 40% of the overall market. And we have now an offering in the market. The key ingredient to that offering is really the pre-trade analytics that we're providing. When you think about blocks, traders are quite sensitive about information leakage and providing tools that protect that information, the information around the block and reduce that information linked it to the key ingredient. So some of the data that we're providing, obviously, dealer access is an important tool for clients to pick their counterparties. But we are also offering AI-driven dealer selection data, which really -- that's the feedback we've been getting. That selection tool has been quite powerful for clients to select dealers that increase their likelihood of a response. So if you're sharing that large block information, we want to have certainty that the dealer will be responsive to that block. And that AI selection tool is just getting feedback from clients quite powerful. So again, very early days. We just have it out with a few pilot clients, but the feedback is quite positive. And again, we're -- our strategy there is replicate what is done on phone and in chat, but do it with better data, better information and fewer clicks for the trader to get the trade done and off and reduce overall information leakage for the trader. So early days, but very excited about the market opportunity that sits in front of us.
Chris Allen: And just a quick follow-up on that. So we should be thinking about time frame here more as a 2025 or maybe even later '25 opportunity. This going to be a client -- a trade-by-trade type of rollout where you need to educate them on the tools?
Chris Concannon: Definitely. It's a 2025. We have a series of enhancements before the end of this year to the platform, and then we continue those enhancements in the first quarter. We're still, again, as part of our high-touch strategy, we have both block trading as well as portfolio trading. We include both of those in the high-touch strategy and we continue to roll out enhancements in both categories. But as you mentioned, it is a trader by trader targeting that we're doing. The key ingredient, and you see this in portfolio trading its larger size, so share moves with those larger sizes. So we are hopeful that the offering will attract larger block sizes as well as additional portfolio trading sizes. And as I mentioned, the key ingredient is our proprietary data. This is data that comes from the size and breadth of our platform, and we just think it's unique to the marketplace. And it's really providing traders with insights on how to trade the bond and who to trade with. And that's something that can only be gleaned from our proprietary data that we have.
Rich Schiffman: I just add something to that, Chris. Yes. Just one extra comment. It's Rich here. I was going to make about that is that depending upon the firm, Chris is talking about trader-to-trader behavior changes. There are some shops where these kind of high-touch large block trades or maybe being done by someone who's not as involved in electronic trading, not doing the typical flow trades where they're taking advantage of our automation solutions and things. We do a meaningful amount of block business now. The number is around 23% or so of our volume in blocks and IG. Much of that is happening from traders that are using our solutions across the range of sizes and activity they have to do. So a big part of our focus with the high-touch effort is getting to these traders that are not the most active electronic traders at this time in the market.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm : Yes. Good morning, everyone. I want to shift gears quickly to portfolio trading obviously, very nice gains during the quarter and good to see that the market share is kind of in line with the overall market share for you guys now. But obviously, curious why the gains and where we go from here? So just maybe specifically, do you see that clients basically now thinking that you are on par with your primary competitor and giving you maybe 20% of the share? Or do you think your product is actually superior you're hearing from clients that there's more to come? And yes, where are different client types when it comes to having fully embraced your portfolio trading offering so far?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Great, Alex. On portfolio trading, I'll be candid, we're coming from behind in our offering. So we are continuing to deliver more and more solutions around portfolio trading. We just rolled out two weeks ago an enhancement to our portfolio trading tool to make it seamless for what we call benchmark trading, trading relative to a benchmark plus or minus a benchmark is an important feature in the portfolio trading market. It's widely used in Europe and widely used across the high-yield market. So we do see that we're adding components that are critical to both high yield and obviously, our opportunities in -- with our global PT offering and in Europe and EM. I would say we are not on par, the honest answer. We have more work to do to be on par. That's the exciting part. We are growing share despite not being on par with the competition. We feel really good about first quarter releases in our portfolio trading tool where we will probably in our perspective, crossover in the offering and the benefits that we provide. Again, clients and traders are asking for unique data and analytics on how to address their portfolio, what to put in their portfolio and then how to manage their portfolio once the dealer provides pricing. And that's an area that we continue to excel at given the data and the analytics that we have. But I'm very encouraged by the growth, as you mentioned, that we've seen in portfolio trading, but I'm excited about the additional features that we're adding in the first quarter and coming at that market with a fully enhanced product offering by end of the first quarter. And so as I mentioned earlier, we are moving from defense to offense across these protocols and pretty excited about what's being delivered just two weeks ago and what we're going to deliver in the first quarter.
Alex Kramm: Excellent. And since you were just talking about data and analytics at the end a little bit. Can you maybe just quickly touch upon the new S&P partnership here, A, what's the revenue and costs kind of direction because I think they're getting a lot of data from you, but obviously, you're getting something from them, too? And then in the -- what you're getting from them, to what degree is it going to help your pre-trade analytics and hopefully help enable clients even more? And when would that be coming? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Sure. Well, number one, it's a great partnership. S&P Global is a firm that we've partnered with in the past, and we all know quite well. Their index footprint is substantial, not only in equities, but across the fixed income arena. They do run indices. The iBox index powers some of the largest fixed income ETFs on the planet and here in the U.S. A key ingredient to the partnership is we're supplying them with our CP+ data to help them power their end-of-day evaluated pricing tool. That tool does price these large ETFs given their index relationship. And that's an important component. When you look at our overall market share, particularly in U.S. high-grade and U.S. high yield, it's heavily tilted towards components of large ETFs. And so we feel like we fit in the ETF arbitrage quite nicely and having our data integrated with how ETFs are priced at the end of the day is an important component to complete the relationship with S&P. With regard to the data they're providing our reference data, and that's exciting, and we'll be rolling out that reference data at the end of the quarter. So just super excited about the partnership. Everything is really going live at the end of Q1, early Q2. But excited that we're expanding our data footprint through this partnership.
Alex Kramm: All right. Thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Benjamin Budish : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow back up on the block trading discussion. Just Curious if you could give any color on the FPM impact. Should you see that share really pick up? It sounds like that's sort of the biggest chunk of remaining non-electronified share? I understand with portfolio trading, it comes in at a lower-than-average FPM. And it sounds like it would be additive dollars, but just curious how we should think about the trade-off between volume and what the associated revenues might be if you're successful in this endeavor?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Right now, as said, any income large trades would fall under our regular pricing fee schedule. There are scenarios, for example, single dealer trades where they would be at a discount or at a pre level similar to RPT, our single dealer PT solution. We also are offering process trading and doing that for free. I think some of the competition charge for process trading. We want to make the trader -- the buy-side trader feel the full breadth of workflow from trading over the phone. They're able to process trade across X-Pro, trading with a single dealer, they're able to deliver in fewer clicks than chat a single block trade to a dealer. And then if they choose, they can select a short list of dealers where they can quietly request price and interact with the winner of that private RFQ while protecting market information. So components of that high-touch strategy are at our traditional fee capture and other components will be at a far reduced fee capture, particularly things like process trading and single-dealer trades.
Rich Schiffman: Yes. I just can add one thing, Benjamin, on that. Again, I said in previous calls how the fee capture is definitely a function of the value add that we can we can bring to the trade. So one of the reasons we're so excited about Adaptive Auto-X and when we can bring in some of those capabilities for breaking blocks into smaller trades, it means that we can capture higher fee relative to the trader getting that block done just as a liquidity taker going to the market, right? So if you think about it if they go kind of narrow and the narrowest is if they've got a directly negotiated trade with a dealer, and we're processing it. That's the least value add and the lease fee capture or it might be a courtesy that we offer. But then as they go in greater competition, including if they're choosing to go with Open Trading as a liquidity taker that raises our fee capture opportunity. And then the best case is where they're acting more as a provider. They're taking a bit more time and they're working, say, that $20 million block in pieces of 1s and 2s, and then we will benefit from that -- from those smaller trades and the higher capture. So it's kind of a spectrum, and it really depends on the urgency the trader has and how they're choosing to operate in the market, information leakage concerns come in. There's a lot of factors that are going to weigh in on how they choose to execute that trade. We want to be there for every one of those different ways they trade with different fee capture, again, depending upon the value we add.
Benjamin Budish: Got it. Thank you. That’s all for me, I’ll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Patrick Moley : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the fee per million, I have one on total credit fee per million, it's starting to trend upward again. Last I checked the Bloomberg duration index that you've pointed to in the past as a directional proxy is somewhere in the seven-year range. I think in 2020, 2021, that number was closer to 8.5 or 9 years. So just broadly speaking, what do you think needs to happen to get that average duration back in that 8.5 to 9-year range? And how quickly do you think we could get there? And then just as a follow-up, last quarter, you said you expect to see, I think, a $15 million increase in high-grade fee per million for every one-year increase in duration and then $3 million to $5 million for every 100 basis point decline in rates. Is that still how we should kind of think about the dynamic there? Thanks.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Thanks so much for the question. Yes, I mean, we actually are at about that 9-year level that you mentioned for the third quarter, and that was up from about 8.6 years that we saw in terms of the weighted average years to maturity in the second quarter. And so if you think about what you just saw in October, right? We were at about 9.1 in weighted average years to maturity, which was roughly in line with September. So we are consistently seeing our weighted average years to maturity on the platform above the Bloomberg numbers that you just talked about. In terms of the sensitivity, you're right. The first -- and there's -- think about it this way, right? It's about duration. And so there are pieces to it. There's the weighted average years to maturity that we talked about, and that is still -- that still remains, right? For every one-year increase in the weighted average years to maturity trading on the platform. We expect to see a benefit of approximately $15 or so per million in high grade. But the other component of that, right, when you think about duration is yield. And so if you look at yields in terms of the sensitivity, the first 100 basis points lower in terms of yield is likely to be a benefit to high-grade fee capture of about $3 to $5 per million. So when you think about duration, we think about both of those pieces dated average years maturity is also really important. But just to round out that discussion on the sensitivity, I wanted to bring that other point up as well.
Patrick Moley: All right. That’s it for me. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Jeff Schmitt : Good morning. So your growth in emerging markets continues to be really strong, a sense on how much your market share is increasing there. And what does the competitive landscape look like in places like Latin America and APAC, which year-over-year growing at a high rate in?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Happy to take that one. In emerging markets, obviously, there's a lot of excitement around our emerging markets growth, just looking at our Q3 numbers, up 19% year-over-year. One area of growth that's exciting is our block trading. We did hit a record in volume in block trading. That was up 24%. And another area that we rarely talk about is our portfolio trading solution in EM. We're seeing growth in our portfolio trading solution as well. I would say there, what's exciting about EM is both our hard dollar position so dollar-denominated EM bonds and then our growth in local market. Obviously, it's at this point, a 50-50 split, but a lot of our growth is in those local markets. When I look at the competitive landscape, it's quite clear. The phone is the number 1 competitor. We see in those local markets a heavily brokered market, where electronic trading has not really penetrated those markets. And so from a competitive landscape, we're quite excited that it's really new electronic solutions coming to market not just additional competitors in the space. And then the other area that we're seeing great growth in EM is a new protocol or request for market which is really driving some of our block trading success. Again, request for market is, it reduces the amount of information a client provides to the dealer community when they request for price because they're just asking -- they're not showing their side or direction. So it's a very powerful tool in trading blocks, and that's an area where we're seeing a great deal of growth.
Rich Schiffman: Jeff, it's Rich. I'll just add one more thing to that. One of the reasons we feel really strongly about this business and the moat that we are building around it, and increasing our competitive position here. And that's with Open Trading in emerging markets. So we've spent years building up a global network of participants, especially in the emerging markets areas. In LatAm, in the APAC region, really pleased to see that Open Trading now is representing almost 45% of the liquidity that we're providing to our clients that are taking there that's up over 600 basis points year-on-year in the third quarter. So that's a really difficult thing to build up, and it's a big differentiator and it's drawing clients to trade electronically to get that extra liquidity and that improved pricing. So and that's in the hard currency area. We've recently introduced it also in select local markets as well, which allows international investors to tap into liquidity providers from in those local markets. So that's something else that's not so easy to do on the phone and it's drawing people to the platform. So feeling really good about the EM business.
Jeff Schmitt: And then in the dealer-to-dealer channel, could you discuss kind of some of the things you're doing to increase share there? I mean, it seems to be, I guess, largely focused on kind of extending automated services. But could you discuss that in more of that opportunity in more detail? Or is there other things you plan on sort of doing there over time?
Rich Schiffman: Yes. The dealer business is definitely one area of significant investment for us. We know there's a lot of activity. Typically, 20% as high as 30% of any of the given markets that we're in. is coming from business dealers looking for liquidity, looking to move risk out of their books more quickly. And if they can't sell bonds to their clients, they want to move it in electronic trading and the services offering, we think is a great option for that. So it starts with our flagship protocol, which is RFQ, and we continue to invest and make that more productive for the sell-side traders to use to have the same capabilities as our buy-side clients in terms of their ability to seek liquidity that way. We brought our automation solutions into these -- for the traders on the sell side so that they can operate more efficiently. And importantly, the automation is tied into the ability to elevate the awareness of particular inquiries, so that if they have a target of, let's say, they want to trade it mid or they want to trade at side, that will raise the awareness of those inquiries to the liquidity providers on the other side and serves to get them better responses. So that's another key thing. We recently announced a protocol called Work up which has always been kind of prevalent in the interdealer broker space going by voice, and it allows us to bring in parties who want to trade at a level that's been established in the market from a trade that begins on an RFQ. So for example, someone might go out for liquidity on 1 million bonds. They execute that trade and they have more behind that. They might have another $9 million, let's say, they didn't want to show the market the full amount, and now they can work up that trade into a larger size and we've been getting great initial reception. We just went out with this a few weeks ago, and we're really pleased with the attraction on it. Then lastly, we are investing also in the single price auctions or the matching space with our product that we call Mid-X. And we've been getting really nice responses to that in Europe, especially in the Eurobond market, where we're running daily sessions and we're getting good traction there. We're bringing that to the U.S. as well and expect to get good results going into '25. So major areas of investment for us in the dealer business given how significant a portion of the market it is.
Jeff Schmitt: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on some comments around, I think you said deferred fixed investments here as you exit '24. So curious if you could talk about what the priorities of spend are and then maybe how that informs I know it's early kind of the 2025 expense build based upon the actions this year?
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Sure. Thanks for the question, Dan. Yes, if you remember last quarter when we talked about this, we talked about at the time, there was about $10 million that were not in the run rate from the first half of the year and how we categorize those fixed costs at the time were things like tech investments, marketing, T&E and new hires. And so about 40% of those came in, in the quarter. And at the same time, however, you heard me talk in the prepared remarks about the fact that we saw an increase in variable costs, right? And that was about, call it, $1.5 million or so of increased variable costs that we hadn't otherwise anticipated due to the increase in volumes and activity on the platform that you heard Chris and Rich talk about. And so what I was saying in my prepared remarks was, we still think that we're going to be within that envelope, let's call it, of the $10 million we talked about. But there's a little bit of shift, right? Some of those fixed costs that I just explained to you, we expect are going to move out a little. So for instance, maybe not all of the hires are coming in, within 2024. Having said that, we saw an increase in variable. So we still think we're going to be right there at the same guidance, right? Again, variable costs can have swings and roundabouts. But that's what I was talking about when I made that statement. In terms of 2025, to be honest, it's really a bit early for that. We are right in the middle of our planning and budgeting process for 2025. And what I can tell you, and you probably know this having covered this space for a while, is that over the last two years, you've really seen us deploy significant resources into investments, right? You've seen all the development pro building out proprietary data sets to help our clients, that's really been a big focus for the firm. But you've also seen us really instill a culture of expense discipline. And I was very pleased to see the positive operating leverage that you saw this quarter, right? And so you've seen in -- we had on the slide in our presentation, I believe it was on Slide 6. Just talk through a number of the very exciting initiatives that we have planned for next year. And so obviously, there will be additional technology investments in the pipeline, different things that are expected. So to wrap all this up, I would say we're super focused on ensuring the right balance between investing for growth as well as keeping us very laser-focused on disciplined expense management.
Dan Fannon: Great. That's helpful. And then just a quick question for Chris, just -- or maybe not so quick, but curious, change in White House, as we think about competition and maybe the dealers being less regulatory constraints. Do you think this changes any of the behavior or the electronification process -- in the interim, as there's, as I said, potentially less restrictions around some of the financial institutions as a result of the new President?
Chris Concannon: Thanks for that very short, simple question. Look, I really -- the way I look at our business and just more broadly, regulation across the market. We are in a very favorable position where both clients and most dealers are adopting electronic trading at an increasing rate not because of regulation but because of commercial reasons. And so if you look at the large institutional asset manager, while they are growing AUM in the fixed income market, given the rate levels that we're seeing, they are doing it at a lower per million revenue capture, just given the expense ratios that they are running and where they're attracting those assets. So they are all very focused on expenses and electronic trading and as I think about our business, we provide the large institutional investors around the world with technology solutions that simplify their life and reduce their overall fixed costs. And so sitting in that environment right now regardless of what changes from a regulatory perspective or a political perspective, we're in a good position globally. The good news is we had a hedge on the election. Both parties like debt and like to spend government money. And so sitting in the fixed income market, we felt well positioned going into the election last night.
Dan Fannon: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Alex Blostein: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you guys could expand a little more on your partnership with ICE. I think you mentioned it in the prepared remarks, I know the soft wring was originally announced maybe last quarter. But how is it going so far? How are you thinking about the benefits to both of you guys and other areas you could collaborate in as you kind of get deeper into that endeavor?
Rich Schiffman: Alex, it's Rich. Thanks for that question. We've had a long-standing relationship with ICE and it goes back years on the data side in terms of us consuming some of their data and then we sell them some of ours. So we've worked with them for a while. And then through our acquisition of Pragma, they've been a technology provider to the NYSE for some time. So we have worked with them closely. In terms of the initial aspects of our partnership on trading with them, it's been off to a great start. We're really happy with the liquidity that we are getting them from them. It started with munis, in terms of responding to traders on our side who are looking for liquidity and having ICE respond through Open Trading and it also expanded into credit with -- in the high-yield space. They are focused more in small sizes. We often call it micro slots, although we've been surprised to see them winning some larger trades as well. And they've -- in munis, especially, they've kind of quickly become one of the top open trade liquidity providers. So that's really positive for our investor participants to buy-side traders looking for liquidity. It's interesting that the retail bid there, connecting that with institutional investors looking for liquidity can be quite promising. So it's just the start, I think, of our work with them. We have other things in the road map in terms of connecting our adaptive Auto-X, so that our traders using that tool can tap into the liquidity available in ICE, including even the ability to leave resting orders out there as well. And it's an example of something we're trying to do to serve our clients and get them liquidity anywhere that we can find it. And I should say, unique liquidity. Where it is supplemental to what we already provide through our pretty vast network. So in this case with ICE, that was something they brought that we didn't have, and it's a win for our traders that are on the system looking for liquidity.
Chris Concannon: And Alex, I'll just add. It's an important partnership for us. I was pleased and quite amazed at how quickly their tech team worked with our tech team to get this partnership up and running. So we went into production relatively quickly right on the back of the announcement. So it was quite impressive from their side. We have long-standing partnerships, as Rich mentioned from the data side. But there are -- ICE is doing fairly unique things around both data and now potentially clearing treasuries, which is another area that we will stay close to them on any opportunities for treasury clearing in the near future. But as Rich mentioned, the ICE bond partnership is off to a great start. There's connections that we are building into ICE bonds as well. So it is quite a cool reciprocal relationship across the board.
Alex Blostein: That’s great color. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a question for me on the velocity of trade. You've noted in the prepared remarks that we've seen this increase in 2024. This has continued into October. I mean high-grade industry volumes are up 30% year-on-year. Is there any way to frame how much of this increase in velocity in 2024 has been driven by the stronger new issuance environment and the flow-through impact of that to the secondary market versus more secular factors? And if you had to identify kind of the main secular drivers that have helped velocity this year and could continue to help velocity in 2025, what would those be?
Chris Concannon: Sure. And look, we're thrilled with the increase in velocity. We're still not at historic levels of turnover, but we've certainly started to achieve record levels relative to recent history. So it's exciting to see that level of velocity. I think there are a number of factors that are leading to this higher velocity. Some of the basic factors are just where yields are in our fixed income market they're at attractive levels relative to recent history. And you see that in the data with just inflows into ETF and mutual funds. So we continue to see in 2024 high levels of inflows which are clearly attracted by the higher levels of yield. And we don't see an end in that site right now. So month-over-month, we continue to see that be a driver. That money has to be invested. We're seeing tools that allow them to invest, allow our clients to invest quicker. So portfolio trading at 10% of the overall market is part of that velocity. It allows a faster exposure to the fixed income market. It also allows changes in portfolio faster. So that electronic solution is impacting velocity. The overall macro market is also of interest. We're pretty excited about not only where rates are, but that new issue market that you've mentioned while new issue can have impacts to our market share, it does lead to higher levels of turnover, higher levels of velocity. And so we've seen record new issue volume in 2024. And certainly, when we look out further into 2025 and look at where some of the large corporations have dates that are due in maturity levels coming due. We expect new issue to continue into 2025 to help overall market volume. So I would say it's one-part macro market driven by higher rate environment. It's one part where we are in that rate adjustment. We're going to hear more about rates tomorrow, and that will impact portfolio management and turnover. So as rates are moving, we'd expect higher levels of velocity. The last remaining piece in the macro market that we think we are still waiting for is volatility. We're starting to see some level of credit issues show itself and reveal itself in the market, talking about downgrades from high grade to high yield. We've seen some of that as we face more difficult economic times, you can actually predict higher levels of downgrades in the market. And that leads to two things, higher spreads, wider spreads in the market and wider and higher levels of spread volatility, two things that are quite helpful to our overall economics here. So the macro backdrop right now is actually quite exciting for us. We see that as a wind at our back, and we're really not through the full cycle where you start to see those higher levels of volatility. Right now, we're seeing quite high levels of volatility in the rates market. That's why we're seeing record rates volume, particularly in the month of October, but we're still not seeing that bleed into the credit market. But still early days for that.
Kyle Voigt: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Your line is now open.
Simon Clinch : Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we could just go back to $3 per million and going back to the question actually about the changes in the White House right now. But just in terms of the environment that we might now see with potentially high bond yields from here, the mix that we're now seeing in portfolio trading and some of the other protocols. Could you talk about the, I guess, the longer-term the way we should think about the longer-term normalized level of total credit fee per million and sort of where that can go? I know we've got the sensitivities for movements in yields and so on right now. But it feels to me like the potential upside might be limited by some of these other factors like bond yields and the mix? Thanks.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Yes, sure. Simon, good question. Yes, I mean, obviously, we know there are so many different things that go into fees per million and that impact our fee capture, right? And so some of that, I think you just mentioned when you talk about if we see a greater -- and Chris just talked about this a little bit he was talking about the environment. But we see a greater percentage of high yield, obviously, which is our highest average fee product area, that's helpful for capture, right? And so that's part of what he was just mentioning. On the other hand, as you see growth of PT that has a negative impact on capture, right? So that's another thing that you balance. I looked back over, let's say, call the last five years, right? And you had an average of about $173 per million when you talk about like sort of what's a good level. And if you recognize that, that included capture of about $204 fee per million during COVID, which we would not expect to see again, given all of the unique factors that happened during that time period. There's still likely room, right, for better capture than what we've been seeing if a number of things happen, right? And so we saw, for example, the improvement to $154 in October, which was up from $150 in September. So when you see an increase in duration, which we talked a little bit about in high grade, that helps, right? Another thing to keep in mind is what Rich mentioned a moment ago about Open Trading, right? That's our premium price liquidity venue. So an increase in valve we believe would also enhance fee per million because of the increase in activity that could be expected through Open Trading, right? Now what we most likely would not get back in that sort of average fees per million price range that I just talked about was the impact of portfolio trading. And that's been running, let's call it, a negative headwind of, call it, $5 to $6 of fees per million. So I just had a lot of different things, right? But net-net, when you do a combination of, let's say, a lower rate environment, an upward sloping yield curve for high grade, a higher mix of high yield, increased activity and open trading, all of those things can help these per million levels. And that should make us in a place that is likely higher than what you're seeing right now. But again, there's a lot of moving pieces to that, and we'll have to see where it all turns out.
Simon Clinch: Great. Thank you very much. That’s all for me.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Most have been asked and answered. Maybe just one big picture one for you, Chris. You've said before, I think the high-grade market you think will eventually become some 90% electronified and that's up from like 50% today. Just looking back, obviously, over the last 25 years, it's been a long journey, call it, 2% of share gains per annum. And that pace is kind of slowed in the last few years. Do you see that turning around, given everything you've been saying about tackling into the block trade and behavior on the dealer side, do you see that pace inflecting upward in the near term? Or do you still think this will be kind of this last 40% is still going to be kind of a grind? And if you could just compare it versus that first 25 years, to what extent would that be a faster electronification than the prior '25?
Chris Concannon: Sure. I'd like to say it will be quicker than the last 25. Rick fought hard for the first 25. I'm hopeful that we'll accelerate the pace given all the work he's done. Really, when I look at the market and the electronic conversion and the pace of that change I think the first part of that change was more of a network effect, getting everyone on the network, getting people used to it, trader by trader I see a higher level of what I call electronic capitulation both dealer and client are embracing electronic trading. They have made necessary investments to adopt it at a faster rate. And the reason why I'm encouraged by the current adoption is if you look at portfolio trading just three years ago, a portfolio trading by definition, is an electronic solution, it has now reached 10% and sometimes 13% of the market. This has accelerated the velocity of trading. Clients have benefited from that solution, and they're embracing electronification. At the trader level, the more manual traders tend to lead the portfolio trading tools, they are the block traders, the high-touch traders at our various clients. So they have made the conversion. And so that's why we think it's a very right time to start delivering similar efficiencies in the block trading area where they will not change how they price bonds. They will just convert from chat to an electronic click-to-trade solution with dealers. Their information will be protected. The dealers will be protected when trading with those clients, which is an important component. And more importantly, they will have access to data that they haven't seen before as part of that trade. So I am encouraged by what we're seeing in the adoption of our early days of block trading, but more importantly, how fast traders adopted portfolio trading and portfolio trading tools and moved electronically quite quickly because of the ease of use. And more importantly, the overall pressure that we're seeing from our clients to reduce costs and reduce -- and bring in more and more efficiencies. If you just look at the growth of our automation solution growing at 30% to 40% a year. It's now 27% of our trades on the platform. That is the same pressure that we think will lead to success in electronic adoption of block trades. So we're quite excited about the commercial pressures to move to electronic trading and we're more excited about the offering that we're putting in front of the clients right now.
Brian Bedell: That’s great perspective. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a question on the automation suite. Exciting to see representing 11% of volumes today. Just curious how you see that progressing over the next couple of years, what hurdles do you see that limit that from moving higher? Maybe talk about some of the steps you're taking to overcome that. And in particular, if you can elaborate on the next generation of the adoptive Auto-X suite. What might that look like? How you see that offering evolving? And how do you see that progressing as you look out over the next 12 months?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Automation has been a high area of interest among our clients. Some encouraging data, not only are we growing automation. It grew in the third quarter to a record level at 32% year-over-year. So exciting growth rates in that area. But what I am encouraged by is the differentiation or the different penetrations of our clients in the automation area, not all clients look the same. We have very high penetration users of automation, both in terms of the breadth of product that they put on automation, but also the size, we are seeing clients using larger and larger trade sizes in their automation suite. And in fact, in the quarter, we had some record sized trades flowing through automation block size trades in automation is quite an encouraging set of facts. The automation suite is across all products, which is also exciting. So it's in EM, it's in Eurobonds and across high grade and high yield. So it's a cross product solution that we're seeing adopted not just here in the U.S. but across the globe, high demands for automation. With regard to next-gen automation, I'm happy to report, we've just rolled out our new take solution, which is leveraging our Pragma technology. It really replicates a very successful Auto-X solution, but in Pragma’s technology and Pragma's footprint, it allows what would be a traditional Auto-X RFQ to see other alternative liquidity on its path to going into an RFQ. So it really manages orders smartly while allowing the client to choose a very aggressive fee request model and a seamless no-touch solution. So we're excited about the new enhancements that we're putting in our adaptive Auto-X tool, but we're wildly excited about the success that the whole automation suite is having. And if you look at munis, which was the last launch of automation. We're continuing to see growth in our munis automation tool, an area where it's really prime given the very small trade sizes in our muni market. Things like automation are perfectly positioned to reduce workflow for the buy side.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eli Abboud from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Eli Abboud : Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking the question. Quick one on EM. How much of your emerging markets business is coming from U.S. domiciled asset managers and if we get higher tariffs next year and U.S. managers reduce allocations to emerging markets, how material should we expect that to be for your credit business?
Chris Concannon: First, great question because our EM business is quite diversified across clients. In the U.S., it's probably about one-third -- closer to 30% of clients engaged in EM. The next and larger size is about 40% comes from our EMEA-based clients. So most large institutions will trade their EM business from Europe and the U.K. And then the remainder is split between our new clients in APAC, which has been growing, so APAC is a big investor across the EM landscape and our clients in LatAm, another area. So it's really diversified across region, and if you think about LatAm and APAC, that's where we continue to add clients, it's where we're growing and onboarding clients, and they have interest in not only trading EM, but also it's very helpful because they're trading U.S. high grade and high yield as well. But really a diversified look across. When you look at that diversified look of client where it comes to U.S. tariffs, less of an impact from their investment perspective. They are looking at the globe from their unique lens and making investments more around the rate of return, the attractiveness of the sovereign debt, which is a big key part of the local market. So we feel quite comfortable with the EM market where rates end up and really where the EM economies end up those macro issues will probably drive investor appetite in the EM markets and the EM regions across the board. But the good news is our clients are quite diversified across regions. And more importantly, the product of EM is quite diversified across regions. So there's lots of different investment strategies deployed across all the different regional bonds that we offer in our EM products.
Eli Abboud: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: I'd now like to hand back over to Chris Concannon for further remarks.
Chris Concannon: Great. Thanks for joining us this quarter. Obviously, I want to thank Rick for his 25 years and his confidence in me in taking on the company going forward. I certainly want to thank Carlos Hernandez for agreeing to be our new Chair. And I especially want to thank Nancy Altobello, our Lead Director. She has worked tirelessly to make us a better company. I joke with Nancy, that we might be violating some of the New York State minimum wage rules given the number of hours that she has worked. And lastly, Rick is a very important investor of ours. So you should expect to see him somewhere in the queue next quarter, asking some of the hardest questions. So with that, we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful…

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on August 6, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Davidson: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company; Rich Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on the performance of our markets this quarter; and then Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Concannon: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. Turning to Slide 3 of my strategic update. We delivered 10% total revenue growth, including the benefit of the Pragma acquisition, and diluted earnings per share was $1.72. We continue to execute our strategy this quarter and delivered solid growth in commission revenue across most credit products, with strong revenue growth in our international product areas. We continue to be disciplined around our expense management with total operating expenses increasing 12%, including the impact of Pragma. We released our July trading metrics yesterday, which reflected continued solid growth in our credit complex across most product areas. While our U.S. credit estimated market share continues to disappoint, we believe that our core RF [ph] business, underpinned by our differentiated liquidity in Open Trading reflects our continued leadership in the institutional client to dealer e-trading space. We have a clear strategy to return to market share growth through our global rollout of X-Pro. We are also pleased that we are continuing to grow our market share in the global credit e-trading space outside of U.S. credit. I would like to welcome Ilene to our first earnings call as CFO. In the short time that she has been here, she has already made a significant impact on the business. And more broadly, we have made several key hires recently, including a new Head of U.S. Sales, a new Head of Global Emerging Markets and a new Head of Client Solutions, all great hires that significantly enhance the already deep bench strength at MarketAxess. We have always guided investors to look at long-term trends and not read too much into the month-to-month gyrations in our estimated market share as we saw in July. Slide 4 lays out our strategic priorities to grow market share. The fastest-growing segments of U.S. high-grade trades year-to-date have been portfolio trading and dealer-to-dealer trading, up 94% and 31%, respectively. Client-to-dealer trading is only up 13%. Our estimated share in the dealer-to-dealer segment is down slightly, and we are allocating more resources to attack this segment with expanded dealer trading solutions. While our client-to-dealer segment performs much better in periods of volatility as we have seen over the last few days, we have a clear strategy to reignite growth in our client-to-dealer business by capturing more share in portfolio trading and larger trade sizes. This strategy will be executed through our modernized, easy-to-navigate user interface, X-Pro, which we have been rolling out in stages across products and protocols for our clients. X-Pro is enabled by our proprietary free trade data and analytics designed to help traders achieve better trading outcomes. Furthermore, X-Pro is built on cloud-based technology, so it is easy to make changes and introduce new features and functionality in a matter of weeks. With X-Pro, we are enhancing our portfolio trading solution, giving clients access to our full suite of automation and algo tools to improve workflows and building out our high-touch strategy to attack larger trade sizes with unique AI-powered data. As you can see on the slide, we have already completed a number of important steps in our X-Pro rollout over the last several quarters. The next step for our high-touch strategy is to enhance our PC [ph] offering with the launch of our global multiproduct portfolio trading solution. We are also launching our AI dealer selection tool, which is a smart counterparty selection tool that predicts which counterparty is most likely to win a trade. Last, we are rounding out our custom algos with the launch of our new take algo, which will be available to both clients and dealers. Our announcement yesterday with ICE is a great example of how we are connecting to external platforms to aggregate available liquidity, leveraging the deep liquidity across both platforms. We are opening up our network for clients in order to provide them with the tools and trading options they need to achieve their trading objectives. Our goal is to create an interoperable marketplace that provides our clients access to robust liquidity through protocol agnostic solutions. Slide 5 highlights the multiple cylinders that drive our growth across regions and across products. While our U.S. credit volumes have not been where we would like, we truly are a multidimensional growth story as the largest global network for e-trading. Emerging markets is a perfect example of this multidimensional growth story with growth across all regions, as shown on this slide. Slide 6 provides more detail on the strength of our outstanding emerging markets franchise. Our emerging markets commission revenue increased 22%, with EM TRACE-Eligible estimated market share of 26%, and we are seeing strong growth in emerging markets trading activity across regions with record LATAM and APAC emerging markets trading volume up 27% and 35%, respectively. Over the past year, we have experienced a significant expansion of activity across local markets trading. The EM local markets are the largest opportunity in EM from an addressable market perspective, and involve larger trade sizes because these markets are mostly rates focused. The top five local currencies represented 58% of local markets trading volume on a constant currency basis, down from 63%, reflecting the increasing breadth of local currencies traded on the platform. One of our fastest-growing protocols is request for market or RFM, which is perfectly suited for local markets trading where our clients are trading in larger sizes with limited trading data. We generated record local markets RFM activity in the quarter, up 45%, which also drove our growth in block trading in local markets. We are very excited about the emerging markets opportunity ahead of us, which we believe is still in very early stages of electronification. Slide 7 highlights our strategic priorities that will drive our future success. We are focused on growing our fixed income trading revenue, enhancing our client network experience, delivering innovative technology and data solutions and driving a high-performance team culture. It is important to note that our use of AI is a key ingredient across these strategic priorities. In our data business, for example, AI-powered CP+, enabling our automation and algo solutions. In addition, AI also helps to power our algo platform, which was part of our Pragma acquisition. Our AI-enabled Tradability data, designed to provide investors with indicative market depth, is integral to our portfolio trading tool that helps clients make portfolio selection decisions. And finally, our AI-driven dealer selection tool is a key component of our high-touch strategy that targets block-size trading with dealers. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our markets.
Rich Schiffman: Thanks, Chris. On Slide 9, we highlight the expansion of our trading business across geographies, products and protocols. We generated strong growth in international client trade volume and trade count in the second quarter. Trade volume was up 12% versus last year, with a three-year CAGR of 12%. The trade count was up 14% versus last year, with a three-year CAGR of 22%. A key driver of this strength was strong growth in emerging markets trading ADV, up 23% year-over-year, driven by a 26% increase in hard currency and a 17% increase in local currency trading ADVs. We are also seeing strong contributions from growing client segments, including hedge funds, systematic funds, dealer-initiated flow and private banks. We generated $230 billion in trading volume, up 25% from these important client segments, which now represent 26% of our total credit trading volume up from 24%. We are also seeing strong product diversification in municipal bonds with record estimated market share of 7.4%, up from 5.4% in the prior year. We expect the soon to be available additional liquidity from ICE TMC to support further market share growth. We now have the top 10 largest municipal dealers signed up for tax-exempt and taxable trading on our platform. Slide 10 provides an update on Open Trading, our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool. Open Trading ADV was $4 billion, and share of total credit volume was 34%, in line with the prior year. Open Trading generated strong growth in trade count, up 18% from the prior year. Hedge fund trade activity has continued to expand on our platform with ADV of $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 28% from the prior year. A record 204 hedge funds provided liquidity through Open Trading in the quarter, a 5% increase from the prior year. Lower volatility and lower price dispersion in the market continues to reduce the price improvement opportunity in Open Trading, as shown on the lower left of this slide. Open Trading continues to be the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the U.S. credit markets, driven by our diverse liquidity pool. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown on Slide 11. We experienced another quarter of strong growth in automation trade volume and record trade count, with three-year CAGRs of 29% and 39%, respectively, and a record 248 active automation client firms. Automation trade volume now represents 10% of our total credit volume and a record 27% of total credit trade count. There were 10 million algo responses from dealers, an increase of 38% year-over-year. Now, let me turn the call over to Ilene to review our financial performance.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Thank you, Rich, and thank you, Chris, for those kind remarks. I cannot be more excited about the opportunity ahead for MarketAxess. Turning to our results. On Slide 13, we provide a summary of our second quarter financials. We delivered revenue of $198 million, up 10% from the prior year. These results include $8 million from the Pragma acquisition. Looking at each of our revenue lines in turn. This was the second highest level of quarterly commission revenue generation with only 1Q 2024 being higher for commission revenue. Record information services revenue of $13 million was up 8%. The increase was driven by new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+. Post-trade services revenue of $10 million was up 10%. The largest driver of other income was an increase in interest income due to the favorable interest rate environment, which contributed $6 million of interest income across our investment portfolio and cash holdings up from $5 million. This was partially offset by a $1 million net foreign currency transaction loss. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, and we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.72. On Slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue was $172 million, representing an increase of $13 million or 8% for the quarter. The increase in credit commission revenue was due to solid growth across emerging markets, up 22%, U.S. high grade, up 4%, and Eurobonds, up 11%. Growth across these product areas was partially offset by lower estimated market share and high yield. The reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product and protocol mix, specifically lower high-yield activity and increased portfolio trading. The decline in fixed distribution fees was driven principally by the consolidation of two global banks trading desk operations and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans. Turning to Slide 15. We provide a summary of our operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses of $116 million included $8 million from Pragma. We are well underway in integrating the high-performing Pragma technologists into the DNA of our organization, and we are leveraging their expertise to drive many of our strategic priorities that Chris highlighted earlier. Based on the timing of expenses through the first half of the year and the incremental cost we are expecting in the back half of the year, we now expect our full year 2024 expenses to come in slightly below the low end of the previously stated range of $480 million to $500 million. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our capital management and cash flow. Today, we are announcing that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program of $200 million. This is in addition to the $50 million that remains under our existing share repurchase program for a total current aggregate outstanding authorization of $250 million. We repurchased 243,000 shares for a total of $50 million year-to-date through July 2024. The new Board authorization reflects the Board’s confidence in the performance and outlook of the company, and is a clear indicator of the company’s willingness to repurchase shares more opportunistically, going beyond just offsetting annual dilution from stock-based compensation. During the trailing 12 months, as of second quarter 2024, we paid out approximately 59% of our net income through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. Balance sheet continues to be strong with cash, cash equivalents and corporate bond and U.S. treasury investments totaling $559 million as of June 30. We generated $298 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months as an increase of about 21% over last quarter. We believe we are striking the right balance of investing to drive future growth, while at the same time being disciplined stewards of capital. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Ilene. In summary on Slide 17, we continue to execute our growth strategy and delivered solid financial performance in the second quarter. We have seen an increase in market volumes and the velocity of trading is trending up. These factors combined with the increased potential for rate cuts in 2024 and the recent increase in volatility are all indicators of an improving macro backdrop for us. We are continuing the rollout of X-Pro by extending the platform to our global client base and across most products. We are executing our plan to grow market share, our client franchise continues to expand, and our strong geographic product and protocol diversification continues to drive growth. Last, we are well positioned to deliver higher levels of growth in the coming quarters. Now, we would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Chris Allen: Yes, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the ICE deal. Just can you provide any color just in terms of how it came about? Any color on the benefits of connecting towards largely a retail-oriented liquidity pulling the ICE side? And then Chris, you referred to connecting to other liquidity pools of your algo suite. Is that necessary to really flourish? And how - any update just in terms of the opportunity to connect there? Is that really a possibility moving forward?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Thanks, Chris. First, yes, we’re very excited about the ICE announcement. Just a little bit of backdrop, we have a long-standing relationship with ICE around data. We purchased data from ICE and we sell some data to ICE. Separately with the recent acquisition of Pragma, Pragma had an existing technology relationship with the NYSE owned by ICE. So again, just a very strong relationship there. And really, the design of this partnership came out of the request of clients, clients that see liquidity in both our destination in RFQ, but also on the ICE platform. They have two leading platforms that are connecting their liquidity to the benefit of clients. So it’s a very exciting really response to client needs. As we mentioned, it is a shift in strategy here at MarketAxess. We are opening up our network to external destinations, which is a unique shift in strategy. We have said in the opening remarks and on prior calls that we are protocol agnostic. We want to find the right protocols both internally and externally for our clients’ needs, and that’s really what we’re answering here. We are leveraging our institutional distribution and we see the benefits of ICE’s very strong retail and private client distribution. So putting those two liquidity pool together is really an important benefit for both our clients as well as ICE’s strong distribution. Rich, do you want to add to that?
Rich Schiffman: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Chris. So yes, we’re really excited about this one because it’s complementary liquidity pools. So it’s a great way for us to bring some of that more odd lot liquidity that’s a specialty for ICE TMC to our institutional clients. And as Chris said, we heard from them that - our clients, that they love our institutional workflow, the ability to RFQ and do list and have it processed very efficiently back into those systems, but they wanted to get the odd lot of what we call micro lot liquidity, especially under 100 bonds in size that TMC is really a specialist in. So this allows us to bring it all together for our clients through Open Trading. So they don’t have to do anything different. They don’t have to go anywhere else. They just put their inquiries into our system, their orders the way they always have, but now they get access to this expanded liquidity pool. So it’s a great combination. It will be interesting in corporates as well. I mean that’s, of course, a much stronger area for us, but as we have introduced investment grade trading on price, which is very attractive to private banks, this is another area where some of that retail liquidity can flow through to our institutional clients.
Chris Concannon: And Chris, just to respond to the second half of your question around algo solutions and accessing additional liquidity destinations. With the acquisition of Pragma, we now have the technology and the wherewithal to add to algos, both our internal destinations and internal protocols as well as external. So this does open up that opportunity to have available for our clients a variety of protocols and a variety of both internal and external destinations through the algo technology.
Chris Allen: Thanks guys. I’ll hop back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Patrick Moley: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So you touched on it a little bit in your opening remarks, but in the last few days, we’ve seen spreads widen out and yield curve dynamics look like they’re becoming a little more favorable for you guys. So could you maybe just talk about what you’ve seen over the last few days in terms of client engagement protocol utilization? And any expectations you have about whether this is sustainable and how it’s expected to impact you? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Sure. Well, I’ll start by saying when you walk through the desert and you see an oasis of volatility, you’re suddenly very excited. But three days is still a little bit too early to predict a trend. We have seen certainly positive trends across the platform during the three days, so we are excited about that. There’s obviously - we’ve seen positive activity among certain participants, particularly our ETF market makers, we’ve seen their activities pick up. If you look at just the overall activity of the fixed income ETFs in the market, you saw HYG go from an average of 30 million shares a day to over 100 million shares a day. So certainly positive trends and LQD also went from an average of, call it, 25 million shares a day to just over 50 million shares a day. So many of the positive attributes of volatility are playing out on our platform, and we’re seeing the macro backdrop improve. I would say the question is, is this sustained volatility or is it more short-term volatility that we’ve seen in spikes volatility in the past. I am encouraged that these are economic events driving this volatility, and you tend to have more longer-term volatility play out versus something like a geopolitical-driven volatility of that. So certainly, the rates backdrop is encouraging and the overall macro environment is encouraging. But again, we’re only seeing three days of this volatility. Rich, anything to add?
Rich Schiffman: Yes. Caveat to comment also with three days, and of course, we look closely yesterday about what was going on and when you see the market getting that choppy, that’s where the relative importance of liquidity versus workflow starts to tip the balance. And unsurprisingly, when we looked at, say, OT numbers for yesterday, just to give some color, on a day like yesterday, we see OT up around 50% of liquidity provision and in comp activity, IG and high yield, that’s well above averages that we typically see. I’m not going to say that, that’s sustainable throughout a month, but it is indicative about what happens when you get into a higher vol environment and our clients start to think a lot more about, how do I get the best pricing on this trade? How do I make sure I get responses for what I need to trade versus am I in the most efficient workflow in doing a PT, for example. It doesn’t mean PTs go away, obviously. But on a relative basis, you see this shift back to a protocol where the pricing matters a lot more than in calm waters [ph].
Patrick Moley: Great. Thanks for the color. That’s it for me.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dan Fannon: Thanks good morning. I was hoping you could expand on the rollout of X-Pro and how behavior has changed as you’ve been rolling this out selectively to certain subsets of clients. So just curious as to what the change in behavior, increase in velocity and/or activity has been post adoption?
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Dan. Sure. We’re pretty excited about the rollout of X-Pro. Again, we started this over a year ago, really targeting our most active traders among our largest clients where we saw a high ticket count and they saw - they had a need for the benefit of the new technology and the workflow that it presents. We’re now seeing over 60% of the trade activity from our largest clients coming through X-Pro. So a very successful rollout across just traditional RFQ. The second phase of the X-Pro rollout was really targeting portfolio trading starting in the third quarter of last year. And now I’m happy to report that X-Pro is seeing, just in the second quarter, about 56% of the portfolio trades came through X-Pro. Again, an encouraging stat. And overall, our portfolio trading volume is up in the second quarter and continues certainly here into July. The X-Pro rollout is now headed to Europe. We’re launching what we call our Global PT solution, which allows clients to trade global product across the platform, and it’s exciting to finally have X-Pro in Europe and available in EM, where we’re also seeing growing demand for portfolio trading across both the euro market as well as the EM market. So still early days for the global rollout of X-Pro, but very encouraging signs of what X-Pro is capable of. More importantly, the development cycle around the new tech is quite rapid, certainly more rapid than our legacy platform, and we’re able to deliver new tech and new functionality in a much more rapid delivery, particularly given that it’s cloud-based technology with obviously additional capacity, but the turnaround for development is quite high, which allows us to address clients’ needs in a much more rapid pace. So all the benefits of X-Pro that we have predicted are playing out as we roll out across the globe.
Dan Fannon: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on the concept of moving into larger trade sizes. You have two newer initiatives here with Adaptive Auto-X, which may help chopping up those blocks into smaller trade sizes. And then the high-touch offering that you’ve been speaking about for the past quarter or so. I guess, what do you see as the bigger opportunity for helping move that block market electronic between those two initiatives near term? And how does that compare to how you view the block market evolving over the long run?
Chris Concannon: Sure. On the block market, first of all, just to put it into context, over 40% of the TRACE market is greater than $5 million in trade size. So it’s the largest segment of the market that is still largely nonelectronic. And so solving the transition from phone and chat to an electronic solution is our goal as we set out to roll out new tech and new products for our clients. There is actually an acceptance of moving blocks to an electronic form but provided they replicate the current phone-based market. So protecting from information leakage is probably the key ingredient that we hear from our clients. Our high-touch solution that we’re rolling out in X-Pro, really the first leg of high-touch was portfolio trading with the additional pre-trade analytics that we embedded in our portfolio trading solution, but also carrying those pre-trade analytics into our high-touch solution for block trade sizes. It’s a much more targeted solution where you can target one or several dealers. And what we do is we enrich the platform with unique proprietary data. Two key data elements that I’d point out are, one is our AI-based dealer selection tool, which really is looking at dealer activity on our platform, dealer acts information and helping a trader decide who is more likely to not only respond but win your request for price. The other piece of the puzzle is a new data product called CP Inquiry, which is really designed for both the size and the direction that the trader is trading. It gives real-time price information and predicts price for both your direction as well as your size. So it’s a critical ingredient to traders that are trading block size liquidity and in need of block size liquidity. Those elements are rolling out in X-Pro in the third quarter. So we’re excited about that new entry to attack that 40% market, that is what I’d say, underserved by the electronic solutions. Separately and similar in the target is our algo launches. And we’re now up to about 40 clients using our Adaptive Auto-X algo solution. And you are correct, it is designed to not only help clients trade without crossing spread, but also seek liquidity in a more quiet less market impact method by slicing your sizes down to smaller trade sizes. That is out in the market. And as you suggest, it does target that block market. Rich, anything you want to add?
Rich Schiffman: Yes. Kyle, I was just going to add to this because you asked which one, it’s really important that we pursue both of these strategies. And I think what clients gravitate to is going to be a function of what’s going on in the market. So if the markets are relatively calm and the dealers are flushed with capital and they’re making markets in large size and taking down risk, in our high-touch solutions through X-Pro where we’re giving advice on where a client should go with those orders is a great way to trade it. But if we end up in a much choppier market, and we’ve seen this time and again in the past where the dealers have tended to back off in terms of liquidity positioning and risk positioning, I should say. And that’s a great opportunity then for clients to use our algo solutions, and it makes it very easy for them to leave a resting order in the market and wait till other clients and other risk takers in the market come to them, whether that’s through responding to RFQs or someone engaging directly with that party. So both solutions are being pursued, and we’re kind of positioning ourselves to be successful with this regardless of what the market conditions are.
Kyle Voigt: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Blostein: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the question and Ilene welcome to the call. I wanted to go back to the ICE partnership again. A little bit unusual, so I was hoping again maybe a little more details around it. So can you maybe talk about sort of the goals that you think this could achieve for both of your combined platforms? And how economics will be split either in terms of revenue share or however else it is structured? And I guess bigger picture, munis is still a fairly small part of the market, but are you seeing a push from clients asking you to break down the silos with any other larger liquidity pools, particularly in corporate bonds? Thanks.
Rich Schiffman: Yes. Thanks, Alex. It’s Rich. And yes, this was really about putting out the liquidity to make sure that clients stay with us and keep their orders here. As I mentioned earlier, they like the workflow. It’s very effective for an institutional investor to come in. But the request we were getting is like, well, we don’t want to have to go to another platform to get liquidity, especially on the smallest trades. And that’s where ICE TMC comes in. Now, they can just come to MarketAxess and they can get all of their trades done. So for us, it was very attractive in being able to keep clients on our platform regardless of the size that they’re looking to trade. With regard to the economics, it’s pretty straightforward. It’s each of our platforms, we make money on the trades. Open Trading transaction fees and ICE has their fee model for when they’re trading and the respective platforms are able to collect the revenue themselves. So there’s not a payment going one way or the other. It’s taken out of a markup and best price wins if the level that comes back net of the fees coming across from TMC into MarketAxess, and that will be at the top of the stack, and that’s where the investor will trade. And otherwise, it might be coming directly from one of our liquidity providers on the system. So it’s pretty straightforward when it comes to the economics. The last part was about, you asked about connecting to other venues. I’d say we’re always open to connecting when there’s unique liquidity available that we can bring to our clients. That’s really the driver for this. Is it going to be additive to the platform? If there’s another venue that has the same liquidity sources that we already have, then there’s not really much to add in that way.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Budish: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just one for Ilene. Welcome to the call. Just wondering how you’re sort of thinking about balancing growth and margins? It sounds like there’s a lot of growth initiatives. At the same time, you’re trending towards the low end of your target range for OpEx. You’re buying back more shares opportunistically. So how are you thinking about the priorities there? And any like longer-term philosophical thoughts on growth versus margin expansion? Thank you.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Sure. Thanks so much for the question, Benjamin. We really look to strike the right balance, right, between everything that you’re saying. Obviously, growth is incredibly important to us, and you’ve seen us really invest for growth, right? You’ve seen that over the course of the last two years. And I think you’re starting to see some of the success from those investments. And some of that success actually, these are not mutually exclusive in terms of concepts, right? If you think about what happened with expenses for instance, to your point, this quarter, I would put those into two different categories, two different pockets of success, right? One of them is that we’ve seen some efficiencies coming through from some of those investments. And you can really see that with - like a good example is the Pragma acquisition, right? So that’s something that we did for both growth and efficiency and really being able to leverage that technology. If we go into sort of expenses again, I’m happy to kind of go into more detail here. I’m sure some folks have some questions about this as well. But if you look at sort of - Chris also talked about some really important hires, right, that have not yet come on and they’re not yet in our run rate from an expense perspective. We expect, if you think about sort of other things to drive growth in the back half of the year, that we would see maybe another $10 million in timing of expenses that are not in the current run rate. And so that includes things like marketing expense, T&E, things like that, and so those are - as well as some more technology expense. So you can see in the way I’m answering this that these are not mutually exclusive concepts, right? You can run a disciplined, efficient organization while you are investing in driving growth. And I think that’s really our focus on our plan.
Benjamin Budish: Got it. That’s helpful. I’ll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jeff Schmitt: Good morning. Emerging market volumes continue to be a real bright spot. What’s your growth outlook for EM over the next three years to five years since electronic penetration still fairly low there? And is the opportunity - it seems to be in local currency volumes?
Chris Concannon: Yes. Great question. And obviously, we had a lot of focus on the EM market opportunity in our opening remarks. Obviously, this is one of the largest markets outside the U.S. credit market and a market that we are fully engaged in and continue to see signs of growth across our platform and across regions. In particular, we’ve been adding local markets to our platform. And as you mentioned, seeing sizable growth in that local market arena. And in fact, our overall local market revenue was up 22% in the quarter, and we’re still seeing engagement from our clients across the local markets. There has been changes in the index, the large indexes that are followed by many of our investors, and one key ingredient is India being added to the index. So we do see that broad EM market still being a very attractive asset across the broader investment arena and having access to all those local markets is a key ingredient for our platform. One driver that we’ve seen is growth of portfolio trading across the EM market. So not at the levels that we see in high grade right now. But certainly, there’s higher demand for access to portfolio liquidity in that EM market. And certainly, we’re seeing some benefits across our portfolio trading tool in EM. The other area that we’re seeing growth is in block-size liquidity on the platform. We saw a record of block trading in EM on the platform, largely driven from the local markets and the rates and nature of those local markets. So again, some very positive factors playing out in that EM, market and obviously still highly in demand across our global investors.
Jeff Schmitt: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Welcome, Ilene, to the call as well. Maybe just to go back to the ICE agreement. Can you just talk about just how we think about market share in the space. Does this change that dynamic in terms of how you’re thinking about your overall liquidity pool within the confines of looking at market share and realize that the revenue will happen where it gets executed? But does that change your reporting in any way in terms of something coming through, let’s say, MarketAxess and getting executed at ICE or vice versa?
Chris Concannon: Thanks for the question, and it’s an area that I’ve spent many a year in when it comes to routing and both external and internal liquidity. We’ll be very transparent around both our market share. It’s really based on where the trade reports flow from. So certainly, look, you have two leading liquidity pools, particularly in munis. We hit a record 8.5% of the muni market in July. So we’re very excited about the levels of liquidity that we’re hitting on our own platform. We also have seen the rise of ICE bonds and the growth that they’ve seen in the retail segment of the market. And we think connecting those two leading liquidity pools really solves the need for clients, which is access to liquidity just more broadly across the market. The structure of this is unique in the bond market. But it’s a structure that we’ve seen in other markets play out quite successfully. And when I look at our client needs and where there are areas of resources are being dedicated, it’s largely being dedicated to collection of assets and not really technology solutions for trading assets. And so we’re helping solve those resource needs. Large institutional investors are able to access our platform and now will be able to access both our platform in another leading pool of liquidity through the ICE bonds relationship. So it’s really solving client needs, which is the focus. Obviously, we’ll be very transparent on where transactions take place and who’s the beneficiary of those - of that revenue getting executed.
Brian Bedell: Yes. That’s great color. And then maybe just on the pricing. I realize a lot of this is due to the mix, certainly between high yield and investment grade. But as portfolio trading or as you’re more successful in portfolio trading going forward, do you expect that to be a headwind on pricing? And also the high-touch strategy in contrast within X-Pro, do you view that as a counter to potential pricing pressure from more portfolio trading?
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Hey Brian, its Ilene. Nice to talk to you. Let me start on that, and then Chris might want to come in with some of his views as well. I would say the first thing to think about when you look at sort of the fee capture and fees of per million is, overall, how is pricing? What is it looking like? And how are we seeing our fee cards? And they’ve really been stable, right? So we’re not seeing moves or changes really in terms of the overall fee pricing mechanism. And it really is protocol and product mix, which you commented on, right? And we do know that the portfolio trading, obviously, we were really quite happy to see our share at 17.2% in July. Obviously, that had some impact. One of the other things I would note, though, is that our muni business, we also saw good share there as well. And we saw increasing share there, and we had some dealers come on that was part of the MuniBrokers acquisition, and they’re on some legacy fee plans, right? And so there are different puts and takes here. I think we also have to remember how this model works in terms of fees as well. And so if you think of high grade for instance and you think of duration, I think we talked a little bit, just both Rich and Chris have talked about the environment. And obviously, it’s early days. And so we need to see how this all plays out in the macro. But I’m sure I don’t have to tell you, I know how closely you follow what’s going on in the macro, but we’ve seen, for instance, if you think about the curve, right? We’re at a point right now where we see, just yesterday, normalizing, albeit for a moment of twos and 10s, and we’re seeing really the least inverted relationship over the, I’d call it, last what, two years in terms of the steepening of - possibility for steepening of the curve. When you mix that with - if you think about what we’re seeing in the rate environment, right, the forward curve now as of yesterday, it was pricing in four or even five rate cuts. And we know that just a few weeks ago, that certainly wasn’t what we were seeing in the forward. So when you put those macro factors together, and again, we are going to have to see how this all plays out. But when you put those together and you think about duration for us, we know, for instance, that those are positive signals for us in terms of how our pricing works there for high grade. And so if we remind about the sensitivities there, right, every one year increase in weighted average years to maturity traded on the platform is a benefit of approximately, call it, $15 in high grade, right? And then there’s also the sensitivity to yields, right? So if we think about the yield curve, say the first 100 basis points is lower, seeing a benefit the high-grade fee capture of approximately $3 to $5 per million. So when you put those together, depending on what goes on, that’s $15 to $20 in high grade that you can see in terms of fee capture. So I think there’s lots of puts and takes here to think about in terms of the model. But I would just say, overall, keeping in mind that we have not seen differences to the stability of our fee captures. I don’t know if you wanted to add anything on top of that?
Chris Concannon: Yes, Brian, I’ll just add on the high-touch solution that we’re rolling out. It is targeting, obviously, larger trade sizes that come with our traditional capture. There are embedded caps to certain trade fees. But what’s exciting about that opportunity is because it’s direct to dealer and much more targeted to a dealer, we don’t have variable costs associated with clearing that trade. And so our - it scales from a margin perspective quite attractively at the traditional capture rate that we enjoy on the platform, but the variable costs aren’t there. So the margin for those trades are technically higher just given the size of the trade, the capture and the underlying cost, it’s just a platform cost, there’s no variable cost to it.
Brian Bedell: Great. That’s great color. Thank you both.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.
Simon Clinch: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my call. I was wondering if you could - I’m just going back to the comments you’re making, Chris, about the past three days, I know it’s short term, but a lot of the things moving in the direction that you would hope to see. I was wondering if you could comment on what the similar dynamics would be in, say, portfolio trading in terms of overall penetration of the market and the liquidity provided for that protocol in a period of heightened volatility. Have you seen any sort of real change in dynamic there? That would be useful. Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Again, it’s three days, so I do want to caveat what we’re seeing in just three days. I do think portfolio trading is a key tool adopted by our clients and will remain a tool for our clients to use, both in times of high vol and low vol. It’s really a question of cost. As spreads gap out in this type of environment, both spreads in a single bond as well as a portfolio trade due. And we’ve seen evidence of these gaps in spread. They do gap out in this environment. So it just becomes a different trade from what it was just four days ago. So we have seen and it’s, again, three days, but lower levels of PT activity. That said, our clients are in when they have either capital inflows or capital outflows depending on the market environment, they may use portfolio trades to enter and exit more quickly in an environment like this, where there’s certainty of execution. But obviously, over the long period of time, we’ve seen portfolio trading, mid-market trading, like those session-based trading, those are harder to execute in heightened volatility versus the low volatility that we’ve been experiencing for literally in the last several quarters, and tightened spreads over the last several quarters. So again, three days does not predict a trend, but what we certainly thought would happen in higher volatility, we’re seeing playing out in the market.
Simon Clinch: Great. Thanks. And I guess just a follow-up. Could you just give us a sense of sort of how you’re thinking about the capital allocation going forward? You use your free cash flow. You’ve clearly - you’ve got $250 million of buyback authorized in here. So how you’re thinking about putting that to work? But generally speaking, longer term, is there any change to how you’re looking at the balance sheet, et cetera? Thanks.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler: Thanks so much for the question. Yes. I mean I would say that if you think about capital optimization, right, and how we look at it and really driving value for our shareholders with capital optimization, I don’t know that - I would say that there’s a change necessarily. I would start by saying that the new authorization really does reflect, as I said in my comments, the Board’s confidence in the future performance of the company and our ability to generate cash, right, as we continue to execute on the strategy that Chris and the team have been talking about. And we really are a pretty strong cash-generative model, and that does allow us to continue to fund growth, right, to self-fund growth, make investments, et cetera. And really, what this is about is flexibility, right? There’s no exploration on this authorization. So it gives us the ability to opportunistically be in the market and buyback when it makes the most sense for our shareholders, right, in terms of we’re going to obviously continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends, buybacks opportunistically. But if you think about kind of the overall hierarchy, our focus continues to be to reinvest in the business, right? We really want to drive that long-term opportunity that we see in the fixed income market. We’re going to continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions, similar to Pragma that we’ve been talking about that allow us to take technology and leverage it across the tech stack, which is going to enhance our capabilities, add to efficiency. And then we would - and I would say it’s really important. One thing I would say about utilizing that cash and balance sheet in that way is that it’s really important to do this with the expected amount of rigor and discipline, and that’s really important. And third, we’ll continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and be opportunistic with that. And that’s really what this is about. We just have that additional flexibility now.
Simon Clinch: Great. Thank so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I just had a question on information services. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate on some of your key initiatives to drive growth with the information services and technology services businesses that you have. I know in the past, you’ve mentioned some opportunities around indexing and end-of-day pricing. Just curious where those initiatives stand? What are some of the steps you’re looking to take over the next 12 months to 24 months? And as you sort of look at the contribution of revenues in those line items today, I guess how do you think about that mix changing as you look out over the next three to five years? Thank you.
Chris Concannon: Sure. Thanks, Michael. And really, we’re pretty excited about our information services business line. We’re excited about the pipeline of products that we’re bringing. Again, first, we’re bringing product to the platform to help traders determine how to trade, when to trade and many times in the context of a portfolio, trade some of that portfolio construction on what to trade. So there’s key ingredients of our data is making its way first to the platform, and it’s exclusive on our platform. We obviously have some very successful data products like our CP+ data across high-grade, high-yield Eurobonds and more importantly EM, I do think our opportunities in the international sector are quite exciting, particularly those local markets that we’ve talked about today. Our CP+ for EM is in a backdrop of a market where there’s no TRACE, no last sale. These are dark markets, generally broker-driven market. So having a real-time feed is a very important component to being a dealer or being a client in that market. So we do see a great opportunity for our real-time data feed across the international sector and certainly seeing opportunities as we offer that data feed in APAC, in LATAM and throughout Europe. Many of the products that we’re putting on the platform like tradability, AI Dealer Selection, CP Inquiry, these are designed for both how traders engage the market, and that’s why they’re exclusively on our X-Pro platform, but also they can be - can help portfolio managers construct portfolios on any given day. So we see an opportunity of pipeline opportunity, not just at the trader level, but also at the portfolio construction level. Separately, you mentioned our index opportunities. Obviously, we announced a partnership with MSCI. We’re excited about the indexes that we have crafted with MSCI as part of that partnership, and we think there’s a bigger opportunity in that fixed income index market as more and more products and more and more investors move to passive strategies across the fixed income landscape and not just managed strategies. So and then finally, we haven’t talked about it in a while, but the launch of CP+ for munis is very exciting for us. Not only does it help power our automation suite in the muni market, which is growing rapidly, but it’s a new data product, a new real-time data product in the muni market and something that is certainly needed in that market. So we see a really heightened opportunity as we roll out CP+ for munis as well. So again, strong product in the current mix and opportunities for growth, but very excited about the pipeline and the opportunity behind the pipeline of growth as well.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eli Abboud with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Eli Abboud: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you’re connecting to TMC specifically. So I was wondering if there’s an opportunity to grow this partnership with ICE? Could you enable connectivity to ICE’s other execution assets like BondPoint and NYSE Bonds as the next step? Or maybe is there a way to leverage your overlap in fixed income data?
Rich Schiffman: Yes. Hi Eli, it’s Rich. Yes, I mean, it’s really up to our friends over at ICE. We’re connecting in. Right now, I believe that they have not combined their two retail entities. The other one was BondPoint. So it’s possible we could connect directly into that one as well. But ultimately, I think that will be coming together and we’ll connect via the existing pipes that we have. So it’s definitely going to be something we’re going to be doing. Again, it’s not just from munis, it’s for corporates as well. So if they’ve got the additional liquidity on their other venue, I’m sure that’s one that will tee up in the near future.
Chris Concannon: And Eli, I’d just add to those comments. I mean, we are excited about the ICE relationship and more importantly, the retail opportunity that we see in the overall market. We see SMAs growing rapidly. They’re at $2 trillion today, expected to go to $5 trillion. We’re seeing a great deal of SMA activity on our platform because they traditionally come through the institutional execution areas of large investors, but they also execute on a platform like ICE. So I think both parties coming together in this unique partnership leverages the growth of the overall retail market, whether it comes through traditional retail or if it comes through SMA, like we’re seeing on our platform. So yes, a lot of excitement around this partnership. And really what it says about our view of market and market structure going forward in the fixed income market effects.
Eli Abboud: Got it. And do you foresee any regulatory risks to the arrangement given the overlap in muni execution?
Chris Concannon: No. In fact, these are two connectivity points where their liquidity is their liquidity, it’s represented on our platform, and our liquidity will be represented on their platform as well. So it’s a way for our clients to benefit through a technical connection and a commercial relationship. So we would not expect any regulatory concerns around how we structured the partnership.
Eli Abboud: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Operator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Chris Concannon for closing remarks.
Chris Concannon: Thank you for joining us today. Obviously, we’re excited about the macro backdrop in the market and recent volatility, and looking forward to update you at the next quarter. So thanks for joining us today.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. 
 [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on May 7, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. 
Stephen Davidson: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company. Rich Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on the performance of our markets this quarter, and then I will review the financial results. 
 Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. 
 For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. 
 Now let me turn the call over to Chris. 
Christopher Concannon: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. Turning to Slide 3 of my strategic update. We delivered 4% total revenue growth, including the benefit of our Pragma acquisition and earnings per share was $1.92. While we are not happy with recent trends in our estimated market share in U.S. credit, we recognize the importance of being equally strong in the faster-growing areas of the market and we have a quick strategy to return to higher levels of share growth. 
 We are attacking these faster-growing areas of the market while maintaining and building on our leadership in the institutional investor RFQ market. Our strength in this segment of the market is underpinned by our leading global client franchise and the largest single source of liquidity in the credit markets, Open Trading. 
 First, in the quarter, our global client franchise continued to expand. We had a record 2,100 active client firms. Next, we delivered record commission revenues across several credit product areas. U.S. high-grade commission revenue grew 8%, and we delivered record levels of commission revenue in emerging markets, Eurobonds and municipal bonds, helping to offset the impact of lower U.S. high-yield activity. 
 The benefits of our geographic and product diversification continue to pay dividends. Non-U.S. credit revenue was a record $92 million in the quarter, representing a record 44% of total revenue. Last, we continue to be disciplined around our expense management with total operating expenses increasing only 9%, including the impact of Pragma. 
 We delivered these results against a market backdrop of historically low levels of credit spread volatility, which has created the ideal conditions for growth of portfolio trading and dealer-centered protocols. These low levels of volatility have also impacted ETF market participants and hedge funds, decreasing activity in our U.S. high-yield business. 
 We believe, however, that our estimated share will recover with more normal levels of spread volatility due to the diversified liquidity on our platform. We were pleased to see an improvement in estimated high-yield share in the back half of April. 
 We are encouraged by the strong new issuance calendar to the start of the year as well as the increase in trading velocity. Strong new issuance is an indicator of healthy growth in our market and increased trading velocity means that dealers are trading more with much smaller balance sheets. 
 This trend should only continue with significantly higher bond yields making fixed income a very attractive asset class. This is a key attribute of our market today. All our clients need to do more with less, and we are very well positioned to address this need. 
 Slide 4 illustrates how portfolio trading and dealer-initiated trading significantly expanded the overall market in April. Since 2019, portfolio trading and dealer-initiated flow have grown at 4-year CAGRs of 38% and 10%, respectively, compared to 2% for client initiated flow. The growth of these segments is closely linked because dealers typically recycle the risk from a portfolio trade in the interdealer market. 
 For portfolio trading, we have made substantial investments in our PT solution and the share gains we saw at the end of April indicate that we have designed a very competitive trading solution for our clients. We will continue to rapidly deploy enhancements to our platform as we are still in the early stages of PT innovation. 
 For dealer-initiated flow, we are now delivering the same trading automation tools to dealers seeking liquidity that have been rapidly growing with investor clients. These tools improve dealers' trading efficiency and help solve their need to rapidly exit inventory risk. Approximately 30% of the liquidity we provide to dealers comes from our investor client firms. 
 Accompanying the electronification of larger-sized portfolio trades is the explosion in ticket count as shown on the right-hand side of this slide. X-Pro, our new platform designed to make trading more efficient, is now handling 55% of U.S. credit trade count for our 22 largest clients. 
 Slide 5 illustrates key trends in portfolio trading. The growth of PT is a very important step in the evolution of the market. Portfolio trading is a protocol of immediacy, which has helped accelerate the electronification of larger-size trades, representing approximately 10% of the high-grade and high-yield TRACE market in April. 
 Portfolio trading has also allowed traders to do more, more efficiently and with a streamlined workflow. The impressive growth of portfolio trading shows us the sizable demand our clients have for immediacy and efficiency, with the average notional per line item of a PT trending lower. 
 We believe we must address that demand for immediacy and efficiency in all products and across all types of market environments. This is a great trend for the market overall, and it is a strong indicator of future e-trading demand for trades of all sizes. But we do believe that historically low credit spread volatility has created very supportive market conditions for the recent growth in portfolio trading. 
 Slide 6 frames the U.S. high-grade market opportunity. While portfolio trading and dealer-initiated trading have been growing faster, we are also continuing our investments in higher-margin, high-quality areas of the market. Our launch of credit algorithms and block training solutions on X-Pro are targeting the more challenging parts of the market that have not migrated to electronic trading solutions. 
 The client-initiated segment of the market excluding PT is an estimated $620 million revenue opportunity, representing approximately 58% of the total estimated e-trading opportunity in U.S. high grade. And as trade sizes greater than $5 million are broken down into smaller trades, we believe that the higher fee per million, combined with an increase in velocity can drive this revenue opportunity significantly higher. We believe that the market opportunity over the long term is actually moving into our sweet spot, not away from it. 
 In summary, we are attacking the higher growth areas like portfolio trading and dealer-initiated execution while we are keeping our focus on building solutions for the largest, most attractive parts of the credit markets. 
 Slide 7, we highlight the client toolkit we are building for the future. MarketAxess is a global network with a privileged position in the credit markets. The unique tools that we are building for traders are being delivered by X-Pro, getting traders a portal to access our powerful data and analytics, our automation and algorithmic trading tools and the single largest source of liquidity in the credit markets. 
 We are an increasingly integrated ecosystem focused on making life easier for traders while solving for our clients' need to do more with less. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our markets. 
Richard Schiffman: Thanks, Chris. Slide 9 highlights the continued strong expansion of our client network. We had a record 2,118 active client firms trading on our platforms in the first quarter, which included 1,619 client firms active in U.S. credit and a record 1,066 active international firms. 
 Trading volume from hedge fund and private bank clients increased 23% year-over-year and represented 18% of total credit volume, up from 16% in the prior year. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown on Slide 10. 
 We experienced another quarter of record automation trade volume and count with 3-year CAGRs of 34% and 40%, respectively, and a record 231 active automation client firms. Automation trade volume now represents 10% of our total credit volume and a record 25% of our total credit trades. There were a record 11 million algo responses from dealers, an increase of 50% year-over-year. 
 On Slide 11, we highlight the expansion of our trading business across geographies and products. Continuing the theme of strength in our international businesses, we generated record international client trade volume and trade count in the first quarter. Trade volume was up 13% versus last year with a 3-year CAGR of 10%. Trade count was up 10% versus last year with a 3-year CAGR of 19%. 
 A key driver of this strength was record total emerging markets trading volume, up 15% year-over-year driven by a 28% increase in local currency trading volumes. Our LATAM and APAC clients generated record levels of emerging markets ADV in the quarter, up 11% and 55%, respectively. We were pleased to see a strong increase in EM volumes in the first quarter, and that strength has continued into April. Emerging markets continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity for the company. 
 Last week, we announced that Dan Burke has joined the company as Global Head of Emerging Markets. We're excited to have Dan's experienced leadership in this important and growing business. Axess IQ, our front end for private banking clients, generated ADV of $140 million, an increase of 22% and record trade count of 62,000, up 54% compared to the prior year. We are also seeing strong product diversification in municipal bonds with record estimated market share of 6.5%, up from 5.7% in the prior year. 
 Slide 12 provides an update on Open Trading, our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool. Open Trading ADV was $4.4 billion and share of total credit volume was 34%, down from 37% in the prior year. Hedge fund trade activity has continued to expand on our platform, with record ADV of $1.9 billion in the quarter, up 30% from the prior year. A total of 202 hedge funds provided liquidity through Open Trading in the quarter, a 6% increase from the prior year. 
 Lower volatility and lower price dispersion in the market reduces the price improvement opportunity in OT as shown on the lower left of this slide. And it has also impacted our high-yield product area, as shown in the chart on the lower right as ETF market maker activity has declined. Open Trading continues to be the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the U.S. credit markets, driven by our diverse liquidity pool. 
 Now let me turn the call over to Steve to review our financial performance. 
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Rich. On Slide 14, we provide a summary of our first quarter financials. We delivered revenue of $210 million, up 4% from the prior year. These results include $8 million from the Pragma acquisition. Foreign currency was a $1 million benefit in the quarter. Information services revenue of $12 million was up 8%, including a $200,000 benefit from currency fluctuations. The increase was driven by new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+. 
 Post-trade services revenue of $11 million was up 8%, including a $200,000 benefit from currency fluctuations. The favorable interest rate environment contributed $6 million of interest income, up from $4 million. The effective tax rate was 24.9%, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.92 per share. 
 On Slide 15, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue increased $3 million or 2% in the quarter. The increase in credit commission revenue was due to stronger estimated market volume across several product areas, mostly offset by lower estimated market share in high yield on lower credit spread volatility. 
 The reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product mix, specifically lower high-yield activity. The decline in fixed distribution fees was driven principally by the consolidation of 2 global bank trading desk operations. 
 On Slide 16, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses of $118 million included $8 million from Pragma and a $600,000 negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Based on the progression of expenses in the first quarter, operating expenses for full year 2024 are tracking to the low end of the previously stated guidance range of $480 million to $500 million. 
 On Slide 17, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid, with cash and investments totaling $513 million as of March 31, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities. We repurchased 47,000 shares in the quarter for a total of $10 million and a total of $90 million remains on the current Board authorization. 
 During the trailing 12-months, we paid out approximately $110 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.74 per share based on the financial performance of the company. 
 Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments. 
Christopher Concannon: Thanks, Steve. In summary, on Slide 18, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy in the first quarter. The increase in new issuance, higher rates and an increase in velocity of trading all point to a healthy and growing fixed income market. 
 We are disappointed with our market share in U.S. credit, and we've recognized the importance of being equally strong in the faster-growing segments of the market. We have a clear strategy to attack these areas, leveraging X-Pro as our delivery mechanism for the retooling of our trading offering. 
 While we continue to drive adoption of X-Pro with clients, we are maintaining our leadership position in the investor client e-trading space. And our focus continues to be on the largest, most attractive order flow in the credit markets and building the client toolkit of the future and to help our clients do more with less. 
 Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Citi. 
Christopher Allen: I wanted to follow up on portfolio trading. You talked in the past about making inroads into the traders who control portfolio trading, who are also the key market participants for block trading. So I wonder if you could give us an update on what kind of progress you have made there adding any new clients? And also the 40% share noted in the last day of April, was that due to one large trade, new clients turning on or some other factors? 
Christopher Concannon: Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had a great deal of focus on portfolio trading more recently. As you know, we recently launched our new platform, X-Pro, just last year. And obviously, we launched X-Pro specifically for portfolio trading with an embedded portfolio trading solution just 9 months ago. We've been ramping up features, functionality on that platform as well, and we've seen some of the benefits of that. 
 More importantly, we do see that pre-trade analytics, particularly with our proprietary data, is a critical part of that strategy, providing traders with those pre-trade analytics, helps them with not only how to trade the portfolio but also how to construct the portfolio and optimize that portfolio. So that's been an area of positive feedback that we've been getting from the portfolio traders in the space. 
 Again, remember, portfolio trading is quite concentrated somewhere between 30 to 40 traders in the U.S. really drive the largest market share of PT trading and with the largest clients driving the largest share of PT trading. So more recently, particularly in April, we saw benefits of the rollout of X-Pro portfolio trading. In April, it now makes up -- X-Pro makes up about 60% of the volume -- PT volume that we see on the platform. 
 And then with regard to your question around that end of month statistic. End of month is a unique time for us in the market, there's quite high volumes where people are repositioning their portfolio. So you do tend to see a higher number of portfolios. It was not 1 or 2 portfolios. There was a series of portfolios that we saw that day. 
 Rich, anything to add on portfolio trading? 
Richard Schiffman: Just the chunky nature of it, and you can have a lot of spikes up and down, Chris, I mean, with adoption on any given day. As Chris pointed out, it's a targeted group. It's a relatively small number of PTs that we're all after. We estimate about 20 to 40 per day of substantial size, call it, $50 million and above. And we're all going after those. 
 So on the days where we can capture it and we had a great day on month end, you see a number like that, 40%. That gives us a lot of confidence that we can carry that on to -- throughout the entire month. So clients are open to using different platforms. And with being the same across, it's a matter of coming up with the best workflows and unique features that are going to attract the traders to our solution. 
Christopher Allen: And just on my follow-up, I just wanted to ask about X-Pro. You gave us the metric around the top 20 clients, but I'm wondering where you guys stand in rolling it out to your overall client base. And then specifically, where are you in the process for signing up with dealers for dealer access to X-Pro? 
Christopher Concannon: Sure. Again, just to remind everyone, X-Pro is our new platform, it comes with new features and offerings. It really allows clients to trade bonds of any size or complexity, like things like portfolio trading. It also is a cockpit for traders to start their day. So it is a unique offering from market access. We rolled out X-Pro for RFQ, traditional RFQ last year. We were targeting our largest clients. 
 And within our largest clients, what we call our power users, these are traders that trade higher volumes in ticket count. We've seen, since that rollout, very positive trends as a result of X-Pro use. At the trader level, anecdotally, we've seen somewhere around 20% increase in ticket handling so that there is great efficiency embedded in X-Pro. 
 Currently, with regard to the rollout, Chris, only about 16% of our total U.S. credit volume is going through X-Pro at this point. So we still have a long way to go to accelerate the rollout of X-Pro. And again, as I mentioned earlier, we only launched the PT solution on X-Pro just 9 months ago and continue to add additional features, functionality and obviously, pre-trade analytics. 
 We do have an important phase of X-Pro coming this summer. It's our first phase of X-Pro for what we call high touch or block trading, and that's regarding your question around dealer content. We are onboarding dealer content as we speak. We're quite encouraged by the dealer feedback around providing content to our platform.
 Remember, our high-touch solution, our block trading solution is very dealer-friendly. It allows dealers to be in comp without all-to-all. So it allows them to price clients based on a smaller universe of competition.
 We are also adding to X-Pro what we call unique proprietary data, AI Dealer Select, which helps the clients select the preferred dealer in a given CUSIP or a given bond. So these are all proprietary solutions that we're seeing should be rolled out starting in late summer. We'll start seeing additional phases of our X-Pro rollout for what we're calling high touch or block trading solution. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. 
Alex Kramm: I know there's a lot of focus on portfolio trading. But if I look at your TAM chart, you clearly think that dealer-initiated opportunities is bigger. So maybe you can give us an update there. It's a very crowded space, and you obviously have admitted that you're kind of late to it. So just seeing where you stand today, any inroads you've made, any feedback you've gotten? And how pricing may be a differentiator there in particular? 
Richard Schiffman: Yes. Alex, it's Rich. And we feel really good about our dealer business. It's something that we've been in for a number of years. And we lead there with our flagship protocol, which is RFQ. And we've offered that to dealers for over a dozen years now. And its adoption rate is pretty wide. 
 Where we have work to do is on single price auctions or matching protocols, which have become pretty attractive over the past several years in the market now. That is a protocol where network effects really matter and you need critical mass and we have a solution in the market, and now we're actively working on building up the adoption for it. We're doing that in both London for the Eurobond market, and we're doing it here for investment grade and high-yield markets. And it's an onboarding process and getting the adoption built up. And we're confident we'll be competitive in that space as well.
 We are working on delivering new tools for dealers, similar to the way that we're rolling out X-Pro for buy-side traders, we're going to be doing similar for the sell-side traders so that they can more productively access these protocols. So it's a combination of traders who use it from a front-end tool, and also via APIs for the firms that have their own internal trading systems and they want to connect through there in a more efficient manner.
 So investments in interfaces, investments in protocols, and then also tying those protocols together is something we're focused on, so that someone can try, I'm going to be matching at a mid, if I don't get that available, maybe I want to leave a resting order in an order book or then I ultimately want to tap in, I have to sell or have to buy, I'm going to hit the bid or lift the offer using RFQ. 
 So it's combining these pieces that we have right now, which are kind of operating independently. We believe that's going to be really attractive to the sell-side traders. 
Christopher Concannon: And Alex, I'd just add, as Rich was mentioning, some of the new protocols and offerings that we're providing the dealers, one important one, which only rolled out in December of last year is our automation suite. It's quite a popular suite of solutions for our clients. We now provided that automation suite to dealers. 
 It is now about between 17% to 20% of our dealer RFQ that allows dealers to price quite effectively across the spread using an automated RFQ tool. So that's well received among the dealers and continues to ramp up and we're seeing positive benefits in our deal RFQ volumes as a result. 
Alex Kramm: All right. Very good. And then just maybe just a super quick housekeeping question. On FPM, maybe for the first quarter or April. Can you give us a little bit of a breakdown where we stand on the different product types, high yield versus high grades, Eurobonds, et cetera? 
Stephen Davidson: Alex, it's Steve here. In terms of the fee per million in April, we've mostly seen pretty stable pricing across the products. What you've seen in April was the impact of higher PT, which definitely dampened it a bit. We were down overall about $2 per million. So a lot of that was PT. But I think that the Eurobonds piece was a little bit better if you think about it year-over-year. 
 Last year, remember, we had those crossing trades, which depressed the fee per million, and it came back this year in April back to more normal levels around 120. So overall, I think pricing is pretty stable. It's just that, that PT increase in April was outsized. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. 
Patrick Moley: I just -- not to hammer on portfolio trading, but appreciate the disclosure around market share in the last day of April being 40%. I was hoping you could just maybe frame -- help us frame that, like how did that compare to the rest of the month and maybe where you've been year-to-date? 
 And then given that this is going to be a big focus area moving forward, is there anything you can give us in terms of guidepost for kind of measuring how you guys are performing from a market share standpoint in portfolio trading? 
Christopher Concannon: Yes, Patrick. And obviously, we expected a focus on portfolio trading today, and we've obviously been focused on portfolio trading for some time, particularly with rollout of new solutions to solve the portfolio trading market. We do think the portfolio of trade is an important tool for our largest clients. 
 Obviously, it's a tool for immediacy and efficiency of trading. In this credit environment where we're seeing high levels of demand for fixed income products, that's a benefit to our client franchise, and we're seeing them convert those -- that demand for fixed income into large portfolio trades. 
 I think the month of April was what I'd call an unusual month for portfolio trading. We saw a number of very large portfolio trades during the month, somewhere around $10 billion and $7 billion in size. So those are quite sizable portfolio trades that we haven't seen, almost record size. We expect portfolio trading to continue to be a vibrant part of the credit market, and that's why we're so focused on delivering a solution. 
 As we mentioned, just a number of trades, a handful of trades can swing market share in the PT market. But it's such an important part of our clients' demand for immediacy that we're trying to deliver an enhanced solution through X-Pro to solve the PT. We do think that those pre-trade analytics are a critical part of our traders, and we get positive feedback. 
 We've added things like tradability that help you really analyze your portfolio and make decisions around what should and shouldn't be in the portfolio. We've added other portfolio construction tools as well. And we've also increased the line item capacity. So our clients can trade very large line items, over 2,000 line items is part of the demand we're seeing from the largest clients. 
 So we do see it as a critical tool kit in our clients' tool kit, and we will continue to report. Obviously, we have our monthly reports where we share our PT volume regularly and the overall TRACE PT volume in the market. So hopefully, you could just look out for our monthly reports and you'll see greater progress throughout the course of the year in our PT volume. 
Patrick Moley: Okay. And then you repurchased 10.1 million worth of shares this quarter. I think that was the first or the most significant repurchase you did since the middle of 2022. Can you just -- can you talk about that decision and maybe what we should expect in terms of the size and pace of buybacks from here? 
Stephen Davidson: Yes. Patrick, it's Steve here. So there's really been no change to our approach with capital. I think we're still focused on the dividend. And our buyback activity is really still focused on just offsetting dilution. And I think that we basically front-loaded some repurchases about 2 years ago. So we almost put like 2 years of repurchases a couple of years ago. So I think we'll be opportunistic going forward in terms of repurchases and -- but no change overall in terms of the philosophy for capital. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. 
Kyle Voigt: Maybe just first on the high-yield side. The share has been a bit volatile month to month this year. I guess a question on April with the uptick in share, was that primarily from higher pure ETF market maker flow given some of the elevated high-yield ETF volumes we saw in the month, but the systematic traders have remained disengaged? Or are you really starting to see in April some of those systematic traders or hedge funds reengage in that market yet that you had called out earlier this year that had kind of pulled back? 
Richard Schiffman: Kyle, it's Rich. It's a combination. I mean we were happy to see a little bit of a pickup back from March, 13.9 versus 12.7 from March. We've still got a way to come back, but we're seeing the signs that the market conditions are becoming more favorable. It's a combination of activity from both real money and from the ETF community. So it's definitely trending in the right way here, so. 
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then just maybe one more follow-up on PT. You noted some of the added functionality there. But can you remind us of differences in fee structures in your PT offering versus your competitors? I recall there was maybe something you were evaluating in terms of changing the fee structure of the billing for the product. 
 I guess, have any final decisions been made on that? And do you think that could make a difference in positioning the offering competitively in addition to what you're doing in terms of adding functionality to the product? 
Richard Schiffman: Yes, Kyle, it's definitely a competitive space on PTs. And we've talked about it in the past that the PT fee capture is at a lower rate than income business and substantially lower than, say, all-to-all Open Trading business. And there are different ways to levy the fees. We know there are competitors out there that are trying to make a name for themselves and break into this market even going sometimes without any fees on it.
 We are shifting to a model where it's a levying of the fee on the dealer. It's consistent with the way others in the market are charging and we didn't want to have a fee model that was standing out and putting us in an adverse position. So I'd say competitive on the fees and consistent in the manner of charging fees with others who are levying fees on these trades. 
Kyle Voigt: And so is that already in place? You said the move to build the dealers or... 
Richard Schiffman: That's going to come in place with our next major release, which is coming in the next few weeks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. 
Daniel Fannon: Sticking with the topic of PT. I was hoping you could just talk about what you think the normal steady state of this protocol is as a percentage of volume or where it could get to? I think you put out some numbers previously, but the market has continued to evolve. So I was hoping to get your updated thoughts on kind of what you think that protocol can ultimately be on a consistent basis? 
Christopher Concannon: Sure. I'll take that. And look, we certainly are at a fairly historically low levels of credit spreads and credit spread volatility. That certainly creates a ripe environment for not only in portfolio trading, but also the dealer-to-dealer mid-market match solutions. So we certainly see at these levels of volatility that we've witnessed here in 2024 and certainly, at times during 2023, higher levels of PT and higher levels of mid-market matching solutions. 
 So we -- as credit spread volatility can increase, we do see it impacting levels of PT. Certainly, in April, we had some spikes of volatility. During those periods, we saw slight decreases in PT during the trade day but we continue to see a high level of PT throughout the month of April as volatility decline. So we are not -- certainly not predicting that these levels, historically low levels of credit spread volatility will remain for the continued period of time. They typically go through cycles. 
 We do think portfolio trading -- that said, portfolio trading will be an important tool for our clients, and they will continue to remain at levels that we're seeing today. And we don't expect massive growth of the PT market over time. We do think it'll probably stabilize at a certain level and be just another important part of the market ecosystem. 
Richard Schiffman: Yes, Dan, I'll just add to that. I mean it's definitely here to stay. It provides a lot of benefits to clients in terms of the workflow. It's going to be interesting to see what happens when the market environment changes and volatility increases and the PT becomes a relatively more expensive trade, whether it's still going to maintain the kind of percent of the market right now, we're seeing roughly around 10%. Whether that number goes down, stays the same, I would not think that that's a number that's going to rise in a high vol environment when it becomes relatively more expensive versus doing trades in comp. So something to consider. 
Daniel Fannon: Great. And then just as a follow-up on expenses. I know it's early in the year, but you're already tracking towards the low end of the guidance for this year. So I guess, first, kind of what has changed since the initial guidance a couple of months ago? And then as we think about the rest of the year and the factors are going to take you to the lower than the low end or back towards the midpoint or higher? What are those? Is that just volumes? Is it market share? What are the other factors? 
Stephen Davidson: Dan, it's Steve here. I think if you step back, I think we're exiting a period of some pretty substantial investments that we've made with X-Pro, our proprietary data ADX. So I think we've come out of that period. In the fourth quarter, we achieved some significant efficiencies coming out of the year. 
 And I think what's going on in the organization is that we're more disciplined as we look at the expense base coming out of that spending. And we're looking for opportunities to really be more efficient across the board, but at the same time, ensure that we're really maximizing our investments for the future because we do have that huge runway. 
 So I think that as we went through the first quarter, I think we saw some opportunities to achieve incremental efficiencies. I think that as we move through the year, you'll probably see a bit of a bump up in terms of incremental new hires given the normal seasonality. But I think that the first quarter run rate in terms of comp is probably a pretty good place to be, $61 million or $62 million, and that reflects the incremental hires that we should be making throughout the remainder of the year. 
 But just remember that there is that seasonality in terms of our hiring through the year. So I think we feel pretty good coming in at the end -- at the bottom of the range right now. And obviously, we'll continue to monitor that and update you as we progress through the year. 
Christopher Concannon: And I would just remind you that 18% of our expenses are variable. So that's the piece that can move up or down with volumes. So that's an important component to how we think about our guidance. And as we mentioned earlier in the call, we're tracking to the lower end of our guidance, and it's just too early to update where we think we'll end up being in the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. 
Jeffrey Schmitt: On X-Pro, thinking how does it execute portfolio trades differently than what you were doing sort of prior to its rollout? And I guess importantly, though, like how does it compare to competitors now? Do you have any edge there? 
Richard Schiffman: Jeff, it's Rich. As you note, so from an execution perspective, it's consistent, and we have the back end of the trading system that's managing this. The real productivity gain and the difference maker is on the front end and how traders interact with our capabilities, okay? 
 So think of X-Pro, it's a modern interface. It's designed to better handle large lists and be able to manipulate them more readily, which is something that was more challenging, let's say, to do in our legacy application. 
 So the back end, it's leveraging all of the capabilities that we have in terms of how we process trades and how we send them through post-trade and downstream to the parties. But it's that interaction at the front level, at the user interface that is really making a difference. And that is where we're going to be doing all of our new front-end development is in this new tool. 
 So we're saying earlier, it's not just isolated to PTs, although that's where our major focus is at the moment, but it's also going to be the front end that traders use for the high-touch initiative, and it's already actively used today by traders who need to manage large lists, for example, so it can do several hundred line items in comp, RFQ in comp much more easily than we can do in the old interface. So that's going to be the area of significant investment for us and we believe that's going to be well received by the traders and will lead to more business. 
Christopher Concannon: And Jeff, I'd just add that X-Pro, both the portfolio trading tool and X-Pro for RFQ are all built in cloud-based technology. So it's all new tech that we've rolled out here. It also allows us to make changes and introduce new features and functionality in a more rapid development environment. So we've seen changes rolled out from -- really from trader feedback back out into production within weeks rather than within quarters and months.
 So it's a very powerful tool, not just from the proprietary data that we can embed in it and all the pre-trade functionality that we can offer a trader, but it's also -- it speeds up our delivery to market, any new features, functionality or data that we're providing. So that makes it highly competitive for us in an already competitive environment. 
Jeffrey Schmitt: Great. And then a question on your high-grade market share. Could you discuss how institutional RFQ share is trending? I mean, is that a part of -- in the drop at all? 
Richard Schiffman: Yes. On the share, I mean, we did see a bit of a decline. We are -- upon analyzing that, it's definitely due to the pickup in portfolio trading that occurred and also on the dealer business. We attribute it mostly to those 2 factors. And hence, the extra effort that we're making in both of those areas. Those are the 2 significant investment areas for us to regain share. 
 We think in terms of our in-comp client dealer RFQ business, on very solid grounds with that and Open Trading being the difference maker in terms of the liquidity pool and our ability to do all of the in-comp activity very efficiently for clients. So it is largely due to the challenges in PT right now and dealer business, dealer-initiated business. 
Christopher Concannon: I would just add that our high-grade market volumes did increase in Q1 by 18%. Our block trading ADV increased as well. And more importantly, our automation continues to grow within the high-grade market. That's one area where we're highly penetrated throughout that area, and we continue to see more automation ramping up. 
 And Q1 automation was up 40% and that automation volume is quite sticky. We see people moving into automation and remaining at those levels. So across the high-grade market, we've seen growth, we've seen records and more importantly, we've seen sizable penetration with our automation solution. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. 
Brian Bedell: Maybe just sticking with X-Pro. I think you quoted about 16% of your volume now is running through X-Pro and it's accounting for 60% or nearly 60% of your portfolio trades. Just maybe if you can just comment on where you ultimately want to get that to or you think you can get X-Pro to in terms of your overall volume.
 And then to what extent is portfolio trading a big part of that process or if we -- if the market does shift back away from portfolio trading over time because of higher credit spread volatility, how do you see that algorithm working within X-Pro of getting more of your volume on and having that expand your overall market share? 
Christopher Concannon: Great question. And obviously, X-Pro is designed to replace our legacy user interface for our clients. So we intend to put X-Pro in front of all traders and all clients globally. X-Pro, you'll see X-Pro rolling out in Europe and throughout the international client base this summer. So we're excited to continue the rollout of X-Pro not just for traditional RFQ, but more importantly, for portfolio trading.
 As I mentioned, we started that rollout for what we call power users. That's where we see the biggest benefit. The workflow efficiency designed in X-Pro does help those users. And we do think that the portfolio trading tool is also a benefit. Rich mentioned some of the features and the benefits of longer -- larger line item capacity on X-Pro. We do see -- the biggest opportunity for X-Pro is really this summer and the quarters ahead around the block trading solution. 
 One of the biggest feedback that we hear from our clients and traders are information leakage with regard to all-to-all and X-Pro allows our clients to easily engage dealers directly, either one-on-one or multidealers in an RFQ. That's being rolled out and should -- really, we're targeting to, call it, the $3 million to $10 million size bucket, which is a very large part of the TRACE market here in the U.S. 
 And so really X-Pro is designed to touch every trader, every client and across all our products when we're done with the overall rollout. More importantly, as I mentioned, X-Pro does allow us to move at a quicker pace from a development and delivery standpoint. And that's the most exciting part about this new technology and as we roll out across the client base. 
Brian Bedell: That's great. Actually, that leads into the second follow-up question on that, and that's the large block sizes. So I think you quoted that last time like [ 30% to 60% ] of the market is trade sizes over $5 million. That's obviously been the area where more has been done with voice over time, and it's been tougher to crack. 
 So I guess, what is your view on that part of the market electronifying over, say, the next, call it, 3 years or so as sort of the next leg of the electronification of the market? 
Richard Schiffman: Yes, Brian, it's Rich. I mean we think it's going to increase. And I've said before, we're going to see a high penetration rate across all sizes. Some of that might just be trade processing and more efficient ways to do a bilateral trade with a known dealer. And that's fine. That's part of what this portion of X-Pro is designed to do very efficiently.
 But we want to make sure that we've got a way to -- when a trader puts their orders into our system that they have a variety of ways that they can trade that, whether it's going to be recommending to them who the likely dealers are to engage, whether it's just processing a trade bilaterally with a trade that's been executed maybe on the phone, let's say, or it might be engaging in Open Trading in some way with clients that we're able to identify who are likely to engage with that party on the trade.
 So think of it as a central point where that trader can access all of the tools that MarketAxess has available, the different ways of trading across our variety of protocols, all from one place where they manage their order. 
 And that's the key part of it is once their order is in X-Pro, they can kind of launch off in these different directions, depending upon what's available, what's best recommended for that, how they want to operate, all from one point, which is a little bit different than the way our legacy system works, which is a bit more siloed in the capabilities and making the trader work a little harder to tap into the capabilities. With X-Pro, it's all central and available right from their order. 
Christopher Concannon: Brian, I would just add that we hear regularly from our clients that they obviously want to do more with less. They're not hiring traders on their desks. That's a trend that we've seen. And this area of the market is a fairly inefficient area from just a workflow perspective. You can imagine using phones and chat has not been the end result of this market evolution.
 What we're trying to do is replicate their experience on phone and chat, minimizing information leakage to just the right important dealers in that CUSIP with both the data and the pre-trade analytics and the content that we're collecting and pumping through X-Pro will help those traders, one, identifying the size of their order that the market can consume; and two, the best dealers to interact with for that specific order.
 So we're pretty excited about the opportunity to convert a sizable portion of what is today phone and chat market onto the electronic platform. And it's definitely -- one thing we see from portfolio trading and the demand for portfolio trading is the need for immediacy, certainty and efficiency of workflow is high, at an all-time high among our clients as they see more capital flowing into their own platforms, they are not hiring traders to solve that influx of capital. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. 
Michael Cyprys: I have a question on Pragma. Maybe changing topics away from PT. I was hoping you could update us on the progress there with Pragma. Maybe you can elaborate on the contribution of the business, how you see the growth path ahead. And strategically, maybe you could update us on how you see this being strategically additive to the firm? 
Christopher Concannon: Sure. Obviously, we closed on the Pragma transaction in the fourth quarter, and we're quickly integrating Pragma into the broader MarketAxess technology framework. We're excited about some of the technology synergies that we're seeing. Obviously, Pragma has been a key ingredient to the launch of the first credit algo in the credit space. So we're excited to see that algo and the demand that -- and the feedback that we're getting from clients on the algo. 
 More importantly, Pragma, we're seeing opportunities to use Pragma technology throughout our technology footprint. Right now, Pragma, is consuming some of our automation suite. So what we want to do, the goal of the current integration is to have both algos and automation all be part of one suite of offering, so you can get basic auto RFQ, basic auto responder and a suite of algos all within the same API or the same suite of selection of products. So pretty excited about the integration of Pragma in automation. 
 The next piece of integration that we see playing out is the Pragma EMS solution, it is able to maintain order state and control orders and connect multiple destinations. Obviously, we're using the various protocols within MarketAxess, but we do see an opportunity for that EMS technology to be deployed further in the market.
 So we see further integration of Pragma. It's an important technology acquisition for us. And we're actually seeing higher benefits of the synergy of that technology. We also plan on using Pragma in our dealer-to-dealer business. We think there's interesting solutions, not only automation that we're rolling out for dealers, but new protocols in that dealer suite of products as well, particularly around the mid-matching solutions that we see in that market.
 So it's still early days for our excitement around the Pragma acquisition, but we definitely see it becoming a more important footprint in the overall technology footprint of MarketAxess. 
Michael Cyprys: Great. And just a follow-up question, if I could, on emerging markets. Great to see the renewed strength, particularly in local markets, EM, particularly in April. Just curious what you're seeing there. Maybe you can elaborate a bit more broadly on the EM initiatives that you have and any other regions that you're particularly more focused on? And where do you see scope for more innovation ahead in EM? 
Christopher Concannon: Sure. On the EM front, pretty excited about the growth that we've seen in EM in Q1. Obviously, we were seeing lower volumes in 2023. And we weren't expecting that to change, but it did change and obviously saw record volumes, record ADV and obviously, record commission revenue up almost 11% in Q1. 
 One interesting area that we've seen growth, and it's really as a result of growth of protocol, and that is our block trading ADV is up almost 34% year-over-year in the first quarter. So we're excited about that block trading growth, certainly a predictor of hopefully further block trading growth across all our products. 
 The other area of sizable growth was our local markets. Obviously, they are up 30% in Q1 year-over-year. The local market is obviously the bigger market opportunity in the EM market, close to 80% of the overall volume is estimated to be within the local markets. 
 And then areas of excitement, obviously, we've seen our APAC volumes grow year-over-year. APAC was up 33% in Q1, and APAC was up even further in April, almost up about 40%. 
 Out of APAC, we're seeing APAC as a key driver of our EM volume. Our local market volume, in particular, was up from APAC almost 60%. So that international growth and our international expansion is reaping benefits across our EM market, particularly the APAC growth rates that we were seeing in Q1, and then that continued into April. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. 
Alexander Blostein: Just one for me. You spoke extensively today and just over the last couple of quarters that the path towards more of sort of bridging the gap in IG with some of the market share is likely going to come from PT and dealer-initiated RFQ. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing and the fee per million in both of those? 
 I think you kind of hit on the PT a little bit. But just how does that compare to the kind of $150, $160 that you're running at a credit right now? And do you expect that your initiative there to put more pricing pressure on that part of the market as a whole for other competitors as well? 
Richard Schiffman: Sure, Alex. It's Rich. And yes, I did mention about the fee capture in PT being lower. With dealer business, which tends to be -- it's an Open Trading, it's an all-to-all type of business, where we're delivering more value, our fee capture is relatively higher there.
 And one of the things I should note is when we deliver liquidity to dealers, about 30% of the time, that comes from buy-side firms, not just other dealers. And that's some of the most valuable connections that we can make and allows us to charge a relatively higher fee for that. So I think the prospects for fee capture in the dealer-initiated side of the business is quite promising.
 We should note, and as pointed out during the prepared remarks, that we see plenty of opportunity for growth in the traditional client-to-dealer in comp business, leveraging Open Trading and being able to make those connections between clients directly with each other, into other dealers and things. And that remains also attractive from a fee capture perspective. 
 So the most challenging area, the lowest fee capture is definitely on the PT. It is very much a workflow solution and less about the benefits that we can deliver as a marketplace. And it's when we're operating as a marketplace and connecting the thousands of participants in it, that gives us the opportunity for richer fee capture. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish from Barclays. 
Benjamin Budish: I just wanted to double check on the dealer initiated segment. I don't think you talked about how much of your business that comprises today. So can you maybe talk about that and where it's been in the past? And then looking forward, if you think about how much of that piece can electronify versus the broader market in IG? How do you think about the potential there versus client to dealer and some of the other trade types? 
Richard Schiffman: Yes. Ben, it's Rich again. And no, we definitely feel strongly about our opportunities there. And you can say, roughly speaking, it's about 30% of our RFQ activity is coming from dealers initiating on the RFQ side. So that has room to grow. And again, as I was just saying, it's a promising area of fee capture. That's, right now, using our RFQ protocols. As we introduce our matching solutions in the market, which we know has been very attractive to firms and also our order book live markets is another area that we think is going to be attractive to that user base, it's pretty significant. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eli Abboud from Bank of America. 
Elias Abboud: Can we have a little bit more of an update on Adaptive Auto-X? I think last quarter, you mentioned that 13 clients were using it. How has penetration progressed? And what can you share about the early feedback? 
Christopher Concannon: Sure, Eli. Yes, we're pretty excited about the innovation of Adaptive Auto-X, as I mentioned earlier, it's the first client algorithm launched in the credit space. Right now, we have 25 clients live on Adaptive Auto-X. There's about 30 clients approved, still waiting to be onboarded. And then there's more, obviously, in the pipeline. We also are excited about a new launch of an algo this summer, really a dynamic liquidity-taking solution.
 The feedback has been quite positive, the feedback from clients. We have some very large clients waiting in the queue in the pipeline. We've obviously been showing demos of the product to all our clients, and the feedback has been quite positive. 
 Again, it's still early days with this product rollout, but we're just seeing a healthy outcome in terms of execution quality, both in terms of avoiding spread as well as with some of the larger blocks being sliced into smaller sizes. We're also seeing better trade execution quality as a result of eliminating -- limiting market impact from executing larger block sizes. 
 So again, early days with the product, but pretty exciting feedback. And obviously, the demand is quite high given the size of the client onboarding that we're dealing with right now. 
Elias Abboud: Got it. And you mentioned the block trading had a particularly strong quarter earlier. How much of this is attributable to this early progress on Adaptive Auto-X? Or is it other technologies and protocols that are driving that progress so far? 
Christopher Concannon: Really, the block trading that we're seeing the success in, particularly in EM, we offer a request for market that has been an offering, a protocol that we launched quite some time ago, and that's really been driving some of our block trading experience here. 
 And as I mentioned, in EM, block trading was up 34%. The other areas, obviously, in EM is local markets. We're seeing larger block size in local markets as well. So it's -- and then I also mentioned in investment grade, block size running through our current platform is where we're seeing an increase in block trading. 
 We also mentioned that our intent is to roll out X-Pro for a high touch. Again, that's targeting the block size market, and that's still to come in the coming quarters. So a lot of opportunity around the block size solution, both from algorithms breaking down blocks as well as solving blocks for electronic trading by just reducing information leakage for those size trades. 
Operator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Chris Concannon for closing remarks. 
Christopher Concannon: Great. Well, thank you for joining us today. We're exceptionally excited about the things that we're building and rolling out this summer, and we look forward to updating you on our progress at our next quarter call. Thanks, everyone, for joining. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on January 31, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Davidson: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company. Rich Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on how we executed this quarter and then I will review the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Chris Concannon, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon.
Chris Concannon: Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year results. Our underlying revenue growth trends improved during the fourth quarter as we continue to execute our growth strategy. We delivered 11% revenue growth, including the benefit of our Pragma acquisition. Earnings per share was $1.84, an increase of 16%. U.S. high-grade transaction revenue increased 14%. Emerging markets increased 8% and Euro bond increased by 7%. With these improved results in the quarter, we delivered our 15th straight year of record annual revenue. Turning to my strategic update on Slide 3. First, we are delivering innovation with the launch of our new trading platform, X-Pro, designed to address our U.S. credit market share challenges by retooling the delivery of our trading offering. We are pleased to see our portfolio trading clients increasingly leveraging our unique pre-trade analytics, like Tradability which are only available through X-Pro. 30% of our portfolio trades were executed on X-Pro in the fourth quarter, up from 18% in the third quarter. Next, we are enhancing our suite of automation tools with the addition of Pragma. We delivered new records across our automation suite of products in the quarter. Our automation products crossed a record $300 billion in volume for the full year in the fourth quarter. Adaptive Auto-X, our new client Algo solution moved out of the pilot phase during the quarter with a total of 13 clients, including 6 of the largest. Early results show promising transaction cost savings in U.S. high-grade. And last, in terms of execution, our client franchise has never been stronger with a record 2,100 active firms. We delivered strong growth in our international businesses, portfolio trading and municipals. We also generated record revenue in both our market data and post-trade businesses as our investments to broaden our geographic and product footprint continue to pay off. Slide 4 summarizes how powerful data and content on our platform is helping traders achieve better trading outcomes. We want to capture the full spectrum of order flow in the market by helping traders manage their portfolio composition, protocol selection and counterparty optimization. Our data is at the core of these new initiatives we are delivering through X-Pro. From growing portfolio trading market share to increasing our share of larger-size trades, our proprietary data is what differentiates us from other market solutions. In 2023, we had a record $390 million price responses from liquidity providers across our platform which is growing at a 3-year CAGR of 11%. This unique data set and the magnitude of this price information is what powers our proprietary data and insights that we generate for clients on X-Pro. Slide 5 highlights our action plan for stronger market share growth in corporate bonds in 2024. Using U.S. high grade as a case study, we've done a very good job of electronifying small-sized tickets which has been the key value proposition of MarketAxess since our founding. While the history of electronification would indicate that the largest, most complicated block trades would be the last to adopt electronic solutions. Our market has jumped right to the largest and most complicated trades, the portfolio trade. What is left in the middle is trade size is $5 million or greater which is the target market for the rollout of X-Pro. We've heard from our clients that they need better data and workflow solutions to manage this part of the market. In this environment, hiring more traders is not the answer. To help our clients manage protocol and counterparty selection for larger-sized trades, we have launched Tradability and AI Dealer Select. Tradability helps determine depth of market while AI Dealer Select helps clients determine the right dealers to engage. With Adaptive Auto-X, we are also helping clients manage larger-sized trade by leveraging our different trading protocols, including Open Trading. Helping clients manage small and large sized trades with pre-trade data and analytics, growing our share of portfolio trading and enhancing our dealer-centric trading protocols like dealer RFQ are key objectives for 2024. Slide 6 provides an update on market conditions. In the fourth quarter, ETF market maker ADV our platform was up 68% from the third quarter as market conditions improved but was still down 19% from the prior year. Since the Fed's pivot in early December, we have seen a pickup in duration which has had a positive impact on our U.S. high-grade fee capture. Before I turn the call over to Rich Schiffman, I wanted to provide an update on January activity with one final important trading day remaining in the month. January trends show solid low double-digit growth in U.S. high-grade ADV year-over-year with estimated market ADV up approximately 15%, indicating lower estimated market share. January is historically a lower market share month given seasonally strong new issuance in January. Over $190 billion has been issued to date in January, making it the highest January on record. As a result, trading in newly issued bonds represented approximately 15% of the market, up from an average of 8%. The U.S. high-yield ADV is down approximately 30% from elevated levels in the prior year. The decline is driven by lower ETF market maker activity and increased focus on distressed names that do not lend themselves to electronic platforms and an increased focus on a strong new issue calendar by our long [ph] accounts. Estimated market ADV is down approximately 9%, indicating significantly lower estimated market share. Portfolio trading is on track to be a record month with ADV of approximately $800 million, up approximately 160% from the prior year. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our market.
Richard Schiffman: Thanks, Chris. We made significant progress this quarter advancing our trading business. Slide 8 highlights the strong expansion of our client network. We had a record 2,108 active client firms trading on our platforms in the fourth quarter which included a record 1,638 client firms active in U.S. credit. Trading volume from hedge fund and private bank clients increased 37% year-over-year and represented 17% of total credit volume in the quarter, up from 14% in the prior year. On Slide 9, we highlight the expansion of our trading business across geographies and products. Fourth quarter growth in international average daily trade volume and trade count was 17% and 19%, respectively. This was driven by strong Euro bond trading volume, up 13% and strong emerging local markets trading volume up 26%. Local currency ADV is growing at a 3-year CAGR of 21% and trade sizes, $5 million and larger represents 60% of our trading volumes. Axess IQ, our front end for private banking clients generated record ADV of $141 million, an increase of 67% compared to the prior year. We are also seeing strong product diversification in municipal bonds with record ADV of $539 million. These strong results were driven by record tax-exempt trading volume, up 14%. We had a record 369 active firms on our municipal bond platform and we are continuing to integrate MuniBrokers with Open Trading to expand sources of liquidity for investors and dealers. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown on Slide 10. We experienced record automation trade volume and count in the quarter with 3-year CAGRs of 39% and 49%, respectively and a record 185 active automation client firms. Automation trade volume now represents 11% of our total credit volume and a record 25% of our total credit rates. There were a record 10 million Algo responses from dealers, an increase of 40% year-over-year. To share an example of client penetration, our largest automation client executes twice the automation volume of the next largest fund complex. The firm has made a significant investment in automation. We believe this is due in part to an increasing need to manage large inflows and smaller-sized tickets. There were a record 2.2 million trades of $100,000 or greater in U.S. credit on TRACE in the fourth quarter, up 15% from the prior year and nearly doubled fourth quarter '21 levels. Slide 11 provides an update on Open Trading, our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool. Open Trading ADV was $4 billion and share of total credit volume was 36%, down from 38% in the prior year but up from 34% in the third quarter of '23. A record 202 hedge funds provided liquidity through Open Trading in the quarter a 9% increase from the prior year. Open Trading is consistently the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the U.S. credit markets. We delivered approximately $702 million in price improvement to our clients in 2023 on lower levels of credit spread volatility during the year. Lower volatility in high yield in mid-2023 had a negative impact on ETF market maker activity as shown in the chart on the lower right. As activity decreased, Open Trading share of high yields moved from 50%-plus at the end of 2022 to approximately 47% in the current quarter. Our launch of Open Trading in select local markets including Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and South Africa is off to a strong start. We were pleased to see the uptick in EM market volumes in the fourth quarter given the lower levels of growth over the last 2 years. Emerging markets continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity for the company. Now let me turn the call over to Steve Davidson to review our financial performance.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Rich. On Slide 13, we provide a summary of our fourth quarter financials. We delivered revenue of $197 million, up 11% from the prior year. These results include $8 million from the Pragma acquisition, of which $6 million is in commission revenues and $2 million is in the technology services revenue line. Foreign currency was a $2 million benefit in the quarter. Record Information services revenue of $12 million was up 15%, including a $400,000 benefit from currency fluctuations. This strong performance was driven by new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+. Record post-trade services revenue of $11 million was up 24%, including a $600,000 benefit from currency fluctuations. The favorable interest rate environment contributed $6 million of interest income, up from $3 million. The effective tax rate was 16.9% and we reported diluted EPS of $1.84 per share of 16%. Earnings per share benefited from a lower effective tax rate driven by return to provision adjustments and the purchase of transferable tax credits by the company. On Slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue increased $13 million or 8% in the quarter. The increase in credit commission revenue was due to stronger estimated market volume and higher fixed distribution fees, partially offset by lower estimated market share and lower average fee per million. The bps at 15 in the quarter was a key driver of a decrease in ETF market maker activity which negatively impacted our U.S. high yield market share. The reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product mix with lower high-yield volume and protocol mix, driven by an increase in portfolio trading. On Slide 15, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $120 million included $9 million for Pragma, $2 million in acquisition-related expenses and costs associated with efficiency initiatives and a $2 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid with cash and investments totaling $586 million as of December 31 and we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities. During the past 12 months, we paid out approximately $109 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.74 per share, an increase from $0.72 per share based on the financial performance of the company. On Slide 17, we provide you with our full year 2024 guidance. Revenue from Pragma is expected to grow in the mid-single digits. Pragma's revenue was $8 million in 4Q '23. We expect total expenses to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million off a base of $438 million in 2023. This would imply a growth rate of 12% to the midpoint of the 2024 range. This includes the impact of Pragma, approximately $10 million in efficiency savings in 2024, from the actions taken in 2023 and $4 million in acquisition-related expenses and costs related to the efficiency initiatives included in the 2023 base. We expect the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%. Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $60 million to $65 million, of which roughly 80% relates to capitalized software development costs for the investments we are making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Steve. In summary, on Slide 18, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy in the fourth quarter. The market backdrop improved through the fourth quarter, supported by a potential pivot from the Federal Reserve in December. Our focus in 2024 is on growing corporate bond market share by leveraging X-Pro to retool the delivery of our full suite of products and services. X-Pro will be integral to bringing all our data automation tools and protocols together to address trades of all sizes and complexity. Our client network has never been stronger with continued expansion across client segments, regions and products. As we continue to execute and deliver on our key focus areas for 2024, we believe we are well positioned to deliver higher levels of growth in the quarters ahead. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Allen with Citigroup.
Christopher Allen: I was hoping you could help us unpack the January commentary. Market share decline in high grade, no surprise given the issuance levels. High yield implied market share is about 13% which is fairly low level. So just trying to understand the share dynamics, maybe the traction you're seeing on X-Pro versus other protocols and what contributes kind of the shared lines, maybe a little bit more so on the high yield on the high grade.
Chris Concannon: Sure. Thanks, Chris. First, I want to remind everyone, we have our monthly release coming out on Monday. So you'll have all the details on Monday but we did want to provide some level of commentary because we obviously anticipated questions on the January results. Really, first, let's take a step back and take a look at the macro market. The macro market that was unfolding in December as a result of the Fed pause has been very favorable for our market but more importantly, the broader bond market. And we started seeing behavioral changes that were positive in December from overall market volumes. Some of those same factors that we saw in December are continuing to the 24%. It's an attractive rate environment. Bonds are great investments again. I know people are interested in bitcoin but bonds are much safer investments with great yield. But we're also seeing that in the numbers. If you're looking at reallocations that typically happen at the beginning of the year, we're seeing those reallocations play out into fixed income, both at the retail level but also at the institutional level. So the overall market backdrop is quite positive. We also see a very high demand for new issue in January and that's really reflective of that market backdrop. We're seeing really a record January new issue closing in over $200 billion in new issue in the month of January. So that too is a positive sign. That issuers are coming to market in this higher yield environment and find it quite comfortable to be issuing debt in this overall market environment. So all of those are very positive for the bond market more broadly. And as a result, we're seeing high-grade market volumes up 20% year-over-year and up 40% from Q4 from December, actually. So those are all very positive signs of the overall market environment. Our market share in a big new issue month is typically challenged but we do end up seeing -- and again, today is month end. And so we do have a very -- a large active day left in the month and we typically do see a very strong month-end activity when we see that high new issue activity in the month. People obviously moving out of those new issues and rebalancing happening and a sizable index rebalances is also happening. So we do think today will be a very strong day left in the month. So that's why I don't want to speculate on results at this point. High-grade market share has been stable throughout the month. We're seeing portfolio trading activity. We're seeing our typical long-only clients being very active across the high grade market. So a very stable market share month in high grade. High yield, as you mentioned, Chris, it's certainly a different story. The high-yield market volumes are flat year-over-year. We are seeing investors not showing a big appetite for high yield. We have seen a high-yield new issue this month which is sizable for the month. But where we see really a decline in overall market activities across the hedge fund and ETF market maker segment. It is a broad decline across that segment. So we're not seeing or feeling any competitive pressures there. When we talk to those clients, they are indicating that the overall market environment for their models and their business is has declined. And so it's really a segment challenge in the high-yield market. And you see that in the high-yield ETF volumes are down 20% year-over-year. So there just continues to be a thematic challenge within that high-yield market. We saw that in the second and third quarter as well. We did see some pickup in the fourth quarter in high yield but really that high-yield challenge continues. Other areas of our business, EM. EM had a very challenging 2023. The investment thesis was not attractive relative to where yields were at high-grade market share or even treasury market. So the end market volumes were challenged. We're seeing a pickup, we saw a pickup in EM volumes in Q4 and we're actually seeing a positive trend continue into January in EM with market volumes up close to 10%. And we've even seen -- we're approaching a record in our APAC volumes. So we're seeing positive activity across the international business in January. So hopefully, that's a long-winded answer, Chris, to remind everyone that we do have a market volume release coming out on Monday.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Just staying on market share but zooming out a little bit, obviously and thanks for that chart. I think that's new. So that breaks down the trades volumes and by kind of size of trades and where you focus and obviously a lot of initiatives going on. But when I think about your core business today, can you just remind us what you're seeing on a competitive side there? I mean, obviously again, market share growth comes from gains in these new areas. But just wanted to get an update on how you think you're defending your kind of home turf. And if you're seeing any sort of market participants try other platforms in your kind of home turf like what are the reasons that they are citing why they may be looking at other platforms before they look at yours?
Chris Concannon: Great question, Alex. First, our core business, to remind everyone, is the institutional bond market. Our clients are global and they are seeking liquidity across the broad spectrum of the fixed income market. It's dominated -- that market is dominated by request for quote. We happen to have one of the largest electronic request for quote. I remind everyone that traders are regularly requesting prices over the phone and requesting prices over chat. So the market is dominated by that request for price. The biggest part of the market is the non-electronic part, that phone and chat. So when we think about what is the real competition that we're seeking, it's that phone and chat market that we think is quite addressable and in this environment where we're seeing more trade activity when you think about the number of tickets that our clients have to do with the attractiveness of the overall bond market from an investment perspective, our clients are telling us they are not hiring more traders. They have to do more with less. And so again, that demand from our traditional core client, the institutional client is quite high as we enter 2024 with the positive backdrop for the overall fixed income market. With regard to competitive pressures, we see competitive pressures across the market, particularly in the dealer-to-dealer business where dealers are taking down a large position in a bond and looking to unwind that inventory as quickly as possible. We do think that's an important part of the market and a growing part of the market because if you look at dealers balance sheets, they are not going to be improving with the pending regulatory changes on bank balance sheets. We actually think dealer inventory will be down as a result of those regulatory changes which means the demand for dealer execution solutions is going to be high. So we do see competitive pressures across our marketplace, particularly in the dealer-to-dealer space. That space, I'll remind you, is a quite competitively priced space because dealers can certainly move activity overnight. The other area of competitive pressure is the portfolio trading space. We obviously have seen competitors step into that space and provide solutions and we were slow to move on those solutions. We've now reacted quite aggressively in our portfolio trading, share has picked up and we actually had record portfolio trading in Q4. When I look at the portfolio trading adoption, I made this reference in our opening remarks, I am super encouraged that the most complicated block trade that we see in the fixed income market is now electronic. So if you look at the portfolio market, it's dominated by request for price on a basket of bonds and it's quite a complicated trade. And these are sizable over $100 million in terms of size. Those are now being addressed with electronic solutions, both our competitors as well as ours. And we've just rolled out our X-Pro PT solution with lots of data and pre-trade analytics. So what I'm excited about is that part of the market, the more complicated end of the market has adopted electronic trading for block trades, an area that most people question whether or not electronic adoption would play out. And then -- so those are really the two areas that we're seeing a competitive impact. I don't know, Rich, if you want to add anything to that?
Richard Schiffman: Yes, Alex, it's Rich. Yes, I was just going to say building on Chris' comments, the part of the market where we're strongest, where the Open Trading has the biggest impact, the institutional client business. That's 2/3 of the market. We know we've got some work to do in the dealer business, for example, that's about 1/4 of the market. And then PT, as Chris talking about where we're also growing, that's just 7% of the breakdown. And then the last component is retail which we're really not in and that's about 2%. So we feel really good about our core business, the offering that we have there. And then we're investing considerably with X-Pro, with our dealer business to capture that other roughly about 1/3 [ph].
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
Daniel Fannon: I wanted to follow up a bit on that line of questioning. But thinking about it from a fee per million perspective, how does the increasing contribution from these newer protocols impact the overall fee per million when you talked about your RFQ business, institutional being the strong backbone but how do things like portfolio trading have an impact relative with that mix?
Chris Concannon: Sure, Dan. Happy to start. And I know Rich has some thoughts on that as well. First of all, I would like to start from the larger, broader market backdrop. Obviously, in this environment, post the Fed pause we're actually seeing years to maturity -- average weighted years to maturity improved which has an impact on our fee capture. So the market environment that we're now entering, it's more likely that average -- weighted average years to maturity will increase not decrease. So that's a very positive outcome for overall fee capture environment as we head into 2024. And we certainly see opportunities for that -- those numbers to move around in a more positive direction. Certainly, the dealer-to-dealer business, as I mentioned, is a lower-priced capture rate business dealers are quite price sensitive and we'll move their business around. So I don't expect that business to be at a lower capture over time. Portfolio trading the key to portfolio trading, I think, it is, in fact, a lower capture rate business. But the key to winning that business is really data and analytics when portfolio first came on to the market, we saw clients putting up sizable line items and trying to figure out whether they should do a portfolio trade or not, now that market has evolved quite a bit and we're seeing clients -- the size of the line items are much smaller and that optimizes price. But more importantly, they're trying to optimize price during the trade and that requires a great deal of data and analytics live in the solution that you're using. And that's why we've seen an uptake in portfolio trading on our platform. And in particular, X-Pro is loaded with new data and analytics for traders to determine how to optimize their portfolio on the fly. Rich, any other thoughts on the capture rate?
Richard Schiffman: Yes, Chris, it's Dan, yes, just to add a little bit on it. I mean the transaction fees, I mean, they're broadly set by bid-ask spread in the market. And also on the value of the service that we provide. So it kind of runs the gamut. The Open Trading is most valuable where we deliver the most value to our clients and number was somewhere $700 million-ish north of that in what was a relatively lower benefit delivered. That number has been quite a bit higher in the future. So those trades go for a relatively higher fee rate. And then all the way on the other end of the spectrum is process trades where it's either de minimis or zero and we don't count those even in our volumes. So it's really just clients using our plumbing to process the voice trades. Things like PT, it is closer, it's closer to a process trade than it is to an in-comp trade all to all and taking advantage of Open Trading. So that is going to be at a relatively lower fee rate and of course, you guys are all familiar with the duration impact in some of our fee products where that's going to have a change as interest rates are changing and maturities are changing. One thing about it, we talk about size is also a factor in the transaction fees that we charge and with the move towards automation and Algos being used to break blocks into smaller pieces, that's going to mean smaller-sized trades which leads to relatively higher fee per million capture. So that's a trend that will work in our favor over time. But generally, the rate card is pretty stable and you've got these other variables in terms of product mix, duration mix that reflect themselves in the overall average fee rate that you see published each quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays.
Benjamin Budish: I wanted to circle back to I think it was Chris Allen's question at the beginning. And I know you're about to put out of the January release but maybe thinking about February and how the rest of the year might evolve. Could you maybe talk about the sort of impact of new issuance, clearly, there's a market share impact during that month but how do you see that typically unfold as we go through the year? Perhaps in February is another solid new issuance month. Does that mean at some point, we see a big pickup in secondary market trading and any other macro impacts you think could start to reverse? And what do you think would start to work in the right direction as we go through the year?
Chris Concannon: Sure, Ben. Great question. Look, the new issue market, when we see a record market like we've seen in January, we see that as a positive sign for market volumes and we've seen that play out in terms of market volumes. It does have an impact on our market share but we're more about growing revenue and growing volumes. And so it has a temporary impact on share but a positive longer-term impact on the overall market and market volumes, particularly secondary market volumes. Remember, people are moving out of product and into new issue. They are reallocating typically into that new issue. And we do see that high activity at month end, like a day like today; we'd see high activity as a result of a sizable new issue market as they reallocate those portfolios. What I think more broadly, outlook for 2024, it's quite an attractive outlook for our marketplace and then were a key component of that overall market. So we feel very positive about 2024. I will tell you, our clients are exceptionally positive about the reallocation that typically happens at this point in the rate cycle, where you see people moving from stocks into bonds and we're starting to see that. You can see it in the retail numbers on our market. Retail numbers are growing and that's really reflective. An early indicator of how people are thinking about this more attractive rate environment, so when we talk to our clients, they are bullish about more allocations, more dollars being allocated into the fixed income market. What's interesting is they are not bullish about their overall revenues coming in as a result of AUM growing dramatically. A lot of that AUM will grow in lower expense ratio products. SMAs and ETFs index-based products. So they are still watching their expenses quite carefully even as AUM is growing in this more attractive rate environment. And that's why the demand that we're hearing from clients, they're managing more AUM on the same fixed budget and that requires them to adopt things like automation and use electronic trading, have more efficient tools like an X-Pro. It's really about doing more with tests on the client side. So that is a running theme among our clients in this kind of environment and quite positive as we look out into 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.
Jeff Schmitt: So it sounds like you fully rolled out Adaptive Auto-X in the quarter. Where do you see client penetration of that protocol increasing to in 2024? And as you're coming out the pilot phase, just curious if anything stood out or you want to highlight that you learned during that phase.
Chris Concannon: Sure. And again, we just came out of pilot. So to be clear, we had a pilot that we ran. We now -- we kept that pilot small to a small list of clients because we wanted to really have a focused attention, both in terms of our development as well as our -- in terms of our overall guidance and support for that new innovative solution in the fixed income market. It's the first time an Algo -- a client Algo was launched in credit. So it's a pretty exciting time. We've now -- what it means to come out of pilot means we are now open opening up that offering to all clients. And so the demand is quite high. The pipeline is long. We're super excited about what it means. The positives that we've seen are really the execution quality that clients are enjoying. Remember, this algorithm is designed to be a passive solution so you can manage orders throughout the day and take advantage of opportunities where another client or even another dealer is trying to request price from the market. The algorithm will automatically respond to those prices. So it's quite a sophisticated tool. So it takes a while for a trader to learn all the different versions, all the different algorithms that they can customize and build. So it's an exciting time for us and an exciting time for that rollout of Adaptive Auto-X. More importantly, Adaptive Auto-X is just one feature among many within our automation suite. So we don't -- we see it as a critical piece of the path forward but the overall adoption of automation is what we're so focused on. And that automation suite of products continues to grow. Adaptive -- think of Adaptive as the most complicated, most sophisticated piece of the automation suite. But the demand for automation is high, as I mentioned, given the expense budgets of our largest clients. The other piece to recognize and Rich had it in his opening remarks, the disparity of use of automation is quite high in our market. And he mentioned our largest automation users 2x the next largest client. So when you -- from an AUM perspective, we have not fully penetrated the automation suite across all our clients. So there's large disparity of use and -- but some really exciting use cases. I can't talk about automation without mentioning. We just awarded the largest trader on MarketAxess that trader using -- leveraging our technology, leveraging automation had a record number of trades by an individual 240,000 tickets were executed by this one individual. She is 26 years old and works for a very -- an important client who adopted automation. They saw technology as an opportunity and she took that automation tool and achieved a record volume. So just -- it's truly astounding when you see an individual trader fresh out of college trade over 240,000 tickets just leveraging the technology. That's the power of this automation suite. Adaptive Auto-X is a component of that and the demand has never been higher for this product category. And I'll also remind you that the great part about automation is it's highly dependent on data. So the data that you feed it improves its performance, we alone have that CP+ solution and we also have a great deal of proprietary market data that we're feeding into that automation suite over 2024. So you'll just see a great deal of stickiness around that product. But just wildly successful and really exciting to see an individual trader able to trade that many tickets in a given year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic.
Simon Clinch: Hi, everyone. Just following on from the last question. I was kind of interested is in -- if -- let's put aside the market conditions for now and just think about what's in your control and just how should we think about the speed at which X-Pro and Adaptive Auto-X can actually start to have an impact on your relative market share position in the -- assuming the current prevailing environment just continues. Are we talking about something that can last 2 years to really start to bear fruit? Can we see results this year? Just give us a sense of how the rollout can be managed.
Chris Concannon: Sure, Simon. First, when I look at what we're doing with X-Pro, we have to refresh the MarketAxess technology. We're refacing how the traders in the bond market look at MarketAxess. So it is a technology change that we must make. It also helps our refresh of the entire tech stack underneath MarketAxess. So it's a key element, a key strategic technology change that we're making. The good news, as we make it, we can actually change the workflow for our clients and deliver better solutions and better data to our clients through the rollout of X-Pro. This has been in the works for a number of years. So we're excited that it's now live and being rolled out across our clients. The very positive news on just the basic X-Pro features, we are seeing at the trader level improvements in trade efficiency for the traders on X-Pro. It's been fairly consistent as we roll out X-Pro that the trader volume, that volume of that, that trader handles goes up by about 20% given the workflow and efficiency of X-Pro, the trades that they execute on average go up 30%. So it's a highly useful tool to manage the growing tickets that our traders are seeing on their desktop. We also are embedding unique data features into X-Pro and building what we call a high-touch and low-touch solution. So traditional MarketAxess was very focused with all-to-all on, call it, $3 million in under trades. We actually do much larger trade sizes than that. But the way traders manage their workflow, they were very focused on what they could send to All-to-All and that would be sent to MarketAxess. As you think about X-Pro and its rollout, we're targeting that larger trade size that high-touch trade the $3 million and above. I think of it as the $3 million to $10 million is the sweet spot. Those are a long list of trades sitting on desks that both the dealer and the client would like a more efficient outcome for those trades. And so X-Pro allows a trader to adopt whatever protocol they want. They can load it on X-Pro and do a phone trade, they can load it on X-Pro and go to one dealer. They can go to three dealers or they can go to all to all. All the pre-trade analytics is designed to guide that trader on what protocol they want to use and even what counterparty they want to select from. So it's key ingredients that I think our clients haven't ever seen before and it's a unique offering within X-Pro.
Richard Schiffman: Yes, Simon, I would just add to that. You can think of X-Pro it's the tool that makes a trader's manual activity more productive and that's definitely around the larger trays, more complex or handling large list and things and that's why we have it focused on PTs. The automation, that's going to transform the way people do the large number of flow tickets that they have to bang through and Chris just gave that one example of a trader with hundreds of thousands of trades that they need to work. I can see as the automation matures, gets more widely adopted. If you think about it compared to a portfolio trade which is also a convenience service, right, when a trader buy-side trader has hundreds, if not thousands of line items that they have to get done and they're basically offloading that activity to a dealer to handle the role in one shot. So the automation can actually, I think, eat into that type of activity as people get comfortable with using that and then they can focus their time on the relatively small number of line items in a very large basket that need the traders attention. So it will be interesting over the coming years to see how those two kind of vie for some of that activity.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alexander Blostein: Just another one around X-Pro. And if I were to kind of tease out maybe the message that you guys are trying to ultimately articulate is you're defending your turf in what's been established in high-grade and you're going after larger size in the market with various new tools. So as you're rolling this out, how big of an uplift, I guess, is that for the client? So does that require any incremental technology spend on their behalf or it's as easy as you roll it out and then it's just a matter of them getting to know the protocol and using it? And then I guess, ultimately, when you look at your high-grade market share, what is the goal, right? You guys have been kind of in the range. So if all of these protocols are successful, what kind of market share do you think you can get in the high-grade space?
Richard Schiffman: Alex, it's Rich. And on the first part of the question about X-Pro, I mean it's definitely our objective to make it as painless as possible for the end users. So there's nothing new they have to do. It's really just coming into our workstation as they always do and selecting the new option for using this interface and the ability to get their orders in is also exactly the same as they've been doing in the past. The big challenge for us and this will take some time. Our objective is to get all of the orders from the buy-side traders and even whether they're going to trade it electronically or not, we believe they will benefit from all of the data and analytics that we have in the X-Pro platform and then that will lead to a greater amount of those trades taking place electronically. And to Chris' point earlier, A lot of that is going to continue to be the in comp and taking advantage of Open Trading but there might be some trades or some orders in there that they may just want to work with a small number of dealers and they'll be able to very effectively do that from X-Pro as well. So it's a tool to try to capture all of this activity in terms of share goals, I mean, certainly, we're after the whole market here. But we also recognize that not every order that comes in from a buy-side firm is necessarily going to be out in comp in the traditional way that we've served the market historically. So we're after all of that activity, it's going to come in a variety of ways. Whether it's PTs, whether it's bilateral trades, whether it's fully in comp, whether it's matching, whether it's RFQ. X-Pro is that cockpit for the trader to manage all that different way, all those different ways that they may want to interact with the market.
Chris Concannon: And Alex, I'll just add what's interesting and it's really the -- I mentioned earlier about portfolio trading. We did launch X-Pro for portfolio trading. That was the first piece of the X-Pro platform that we launched and we saw very positive feedback and very positive results around portfolio trading. Portfolio trading will continue to be a big part of our market. It is certainly an efficient way to get exposure for the buy side. But as we move more of the market to electronic trading, those efficiencies should spread across other areas of the market. The way I think about it is what X-Pro is doing is just replicating what the trader is doing over chat or phone. And so it's an easier conversion to an electronic solution when you're replicating exactly what the trader is doing elsewhere because you're not really changing the outcome of the trade. You're just making it that much more efficient to manage that many more line items. So what's attractive about X-Pro is it allows the trader to have pre-trade analytics and then decide what protocol they want to use. And the important part of the X-Pro solution is that high-touch solution, whether you're putting it in a basket and trading it as a portfolio or you're trading the individual line items, you're literally replicating what you were doing on the desk over the phone and in chat. And that's the key ingredient to the offering.
Operator: Okay. Looks like we'll go to our next question here, Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Great. Chris, just going back to a question that you answered two questions ago. On the segment challenges in the high-yield market broadly. Maybe just how are you viewing that playing out? Do you see those challenges being overcome and see more of a rebound in that market in the sort of near term? Or do you think it's a little bit more structural? And then to what extent would that be a potential headwind on fee per million, just from the mix favoring high grade?
Chris Concannon: Sure. First, I do view it as we've seen these loans in the high-yield market in the past. That market segment is obviously a powerful part of the market. But when I look at ETFs, high-yield ETF volumes down 20%, it makes a lot of sense for me. And we've talked to those clients and they explain how their models work and why they're not working in this current environment. We also see the demand for high grade at a high level from the institutional market. So we understand the disparity in product that we're seeing. We've also seen this month a number of distressed bonds move into the distressed category. And those tend not to trade actively on electronic solutions. But the bigger impact is really the segment impact, the client segment impact in high yield. Again, I do think it's temporary and we'd expect that market -- that high-yield market volumes to be up in a more positive market backdrop that we're seeing in '24 and so I do think it's temporarily the market environment that's delivering those high-yield challenges, both to the market, our market segment and then our market share.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler.
Patrick Moley: So I just wanted to go back to Slide 5 and the corporate bond market share opportunity. As we look at these five buckets here, I was just hoping maybe you could walk us through each bucket like what your market share is today? And then given that you've identified it as a major focus area for this year, maybe you could share like in each bucket, like what sort of share gains you would expect in 2024? And then maybe longer term, where do you see your market share growing to in each of these buckets?
Chris Concannon: Thanks. And I wish I could be precise on market share growth across a very complicated set of buckets. But I will walk you through kind of how we're thinking about our attack plan for that market, particularly in 2024. As we launch 2024 and think about our strategy across that market landscape. Again, the overall market environment is positive. So the market that we're staring at, particularly the high-grade market, we think turnover will continue to increase. So the market backdrop is quite positive. I'll do it in size buckets to help the largest size being the portfolio trade -- it's the largest block trade we see on the market. It's the most complicated trade baskets within the portfolio trade are actually growing. So we see baskets over 1,000 line items and I think they'll continue to grow. The reason why our portfolio trade, I would expect that portfolio trading market to continue in '24. As AUM grows at a large investment fund complex, they will use portfolio trading to get that immediate exposure. So sometimes it's just easier given the inflows and outflows of capital to use a portfolio trade but we also have the ability to move that portfolio to trade to a line item trade and have it trade as a list. But our offering in X-Pro is designed to target that market and we're leveraging both the power of X-Pro, meaning the number of line items that it can handle but also the trading and data analytics that are available for the trader to manage those line items, we'll be able to pull line items in and out exchange line item. So we are targeting that 7% of the overall market quite aggressively, largely because not that it's a big part of the market but more importantly, that same trader trades the next bucket which is large size trades. And so being on the desktop of the trader using our X-Pro for portfolio trading is a key ingredient to the next largest size of the market. Typically, traders that are trading portfolio trades are the high-touch traders, so they're managing all the block trades. So we'll be able to arm that same trader with an X-Pro solution, a high-touch X-Pro solution that gives them, again, pre-trade analytics, for each line item, each large block. It can indicate the depth of the market, things like Tradability will indicate what is the true depth of the market? What can the market swallow given the size of the block that you want to trade. And then the second key ingredient, we're already hearing feedback from clients on this one is, typically, traders know the dealer they want to select they don't always know the second or third dealer in that bond. So AI Dealer Select is a key ingredient for the traders as they think about their trading to larger block size workflow. What's interesting about this segment of the market, call it, the $3 million to $10 million or greater than $5 million. Dealers have told us that they've fully automated their pricing algorithms so they can price bonds across a broad set of CUSIPs and icons [ph]. Now that they have that pricing power, they'd like to receive trades in electronic form that they can trade electronically. That's efficient for both the dealer and the client. So there's kind of a sweet spot around that $3 million to $10 million size block trade in our market where both dealer and clients both are looking for a better solution, a more automated electronic solution and so that's the size that we're attacking. And then the other large piece, we obviously are quite sizable in the under $5 million that's where All-to-All is a key ingredient. The size of the trade is small enough that you don't worry about market impact or market information leakage and so you can get the full benefits of All-to-All. It's also the fastest-growing part of the market, as we mentioned, ticket sizes, ticket numbers have doubled over the last 2 years and ticket sizes have declined. So managing small tickets along list of small tickets is a key attribute of the X-Pro solution because it's attached to our automation suite of products, so you can certainly manage more tickets. And then the last piece, the dealer-to-dealer market is a market that we've been serving for quite some time, like things like dealer RFQ is a key ingredient to that market. I would argue that's an underserved market. The dealers growing demand for exiting inventory is high and continues to get higher as bank capital rules come into play. So we do think our investment in the dealer segment with things like dealer RFQ, our mix, mid-market session offering. Those are all at price points that are quite attractive to a dealer -- the other piece of the puzzle is we're seeing dealers come in and adopt our automation suite. So the automation suite that we built out for clients are now being used by dealers for that dealer-to-dealer business. So we're really attacking each one of those buckets and they're largely interrelated buckets as we look at it. Rich, any other thoughts?
Richard Schiffman: Yes. I guess I'd just add to that. I mean, if you look at the slices here, call it, 2/3 there. I don't know we say 20%, 20% if we're using investment grade as an example in terms of market share. You've got -- obviously, the way we come to that number is not across all the different sizes and ways we trade, right? There's going to be relatively lower share in the blocks. And then we have very high penetration in some of the what we call kind of our sweet spot, anything kind of north of 100 million and up to -- going up to about $5 million in things. So that segment of the market, though and I don't have the overall electronic total for it but it's likely it's going to be a very high percentage of electronic trading. And then it's this larger segment here, the over $5 million, let's call it, in investment grade that has relatively lower penetration right now. It's going to be real work to get traders to be thinking more electronic in that size. And that's all the work that Chris has been describing on the other questions here with X-Pro and things. So it's a battle there. It's going to be different types of protocols newly issued bonds, for example, is one that's right now very much tied to going back to dealers and maybe being done more on the phone or via instant messaging and things. So we believe we've got all the tools in the 2/3 of the market and we're investing in the new capabilities now to capture that top end.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toby Voigt with KBW.
Kyle Voigt: It's Kyle Voigt. Just wanted to ask a two-part question on expenses. Chris, you've been messaging for some time now that expense growth was likely to shift a little bit lower versus where you've been over the past 5 years or so. And we saw that in the 2024 expense guide of 6% organic. When I think about the operating environment, still very competitive. There's still a very large runway ahead to capture market share. So I guess the question is in context of the operating environment, can you walk through how you balance pulling back a bit on the expense growth rate in '24 versus maintaining or even accelerating that expense growth for protocol development or new initiatives? And then also wondering if you could just provide kind of an update to medium-term outlook for expense growth and how we should think about that.
Chris Concannon: Sure. So as we mentioned in our opening remarks, we've given the guidance on '24. We're guiding an expense target around $480 million to $500 million with the Pragma expenses added in there. And as you mentioned, that's a single-digit growth rate down from historical growth -- expense growth rate of double digits. We looked at the investments we've made over the past number of years. The firm has grown substantially. Our tech team has grown substantially and that was all because, one, we're managing the current platform, a sizable platform. As Rich mentioned, we're 20% of the U.S. credit market. So there's a great deal of maintenance in the current platform. And at the same time, we're investing in new platforms and an entirely new tech stack. So it tends to ramp up your investment in both people, software and hardware and development and that's what you're seeing in those numbers. We looked at how we allocate those expenses and how we allocate those resources across the broader MarketAxess and we've made some allocation adjustments. So really, what you're seeing in this lower single-digit guidance is really us being mindful of not only the opportunity we have ahead of us but mindful of where we think our focused investment should be. And so that's -- when you think about our tech plant, the X-Pro solution is a global solution. So it's not a high grade or high-yield only. It really is rolling out across the entire globe. We're targeting Europe in the second quarter and we're targeting global portfolio trading in the second quarter on X-Pro. So it's a global solution addressing all of our products. We think that's a worthwhile investment because it obviously brings benefits to each of our products, including things like EM. We're seeing portfolio trading in EM that we want to address. So we're excited about the investments we made. We're not saying we've stopped investing. We will, in fact, continue to invest in technology and continue to invest in people in 2024. So embedded in that guidance is a continued investment in the overall talent in our market. But we certainly feel comfortable about the years of investments that we have made and obviously, a sizable investment with the acquisition of Pragma with all of their tech team coming into the MarketAxess full. As we start to unwind and see the benefits of Pragma in our overall tech stack it's really -- we're starting to see the future opportunities for the Pragma technology moving throughout the MarketAxess offering. So one, Pragma is a key ingredient to our automation offering as we look at the end of the pilot of Adaptive Auto-X and the continued roll out of Adaptive Auto-X, they will be a key ingredient to our overall automation solution. So when we think about low touch trading, Pragma will be a key API or X-Pro solution embedded in X-Pro and so that's part of our tech investment is embedded in that Pragma acquisition as well. So we feel very comfortable about the massive investments we've made and we're looking at moving slightly down to a single-digit expense growth rate. I will remind you, though, that 18% of our expenses are variable. So those do move as our top line will move around. So as volumes go up, our clearing costs will go up as well as a result of that overall volume number clearing through our platform. So right now, we're very comfortable with where we are in terms of the guidance for 2024. We think that's a new expense level that we're comfortable with going forward as well.
Operator: Our final question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: Just a question on the automation set of tools that you have. I was just curious where you're seeing the traction across the suite of tools so far as well as from customer set and what's the potential for generative AI to help turbocharge the offering over time?
Chris Concannon: Great question, Michael. And obviously, I want to talk about automation. Obviously, because the growth rates there are sizable. Just in terms of what we saw in the fourth quarter, our automation grew close to 39% year-over-year. So the demand is high. And as I mentioned on a prior question, seeing a woman of 26 years old, be the number one trader on MarketAxess is reflective of the power of this automation tool. It's powered by unique data. It allows someone who's new to the market, mind you, be able to trade over 240,000 trades in a single year. There is AI indirectly in our automation suite, so our CP+ and the data products that we're rolling out, things like Tradability, AI Dealer Select, those are all driven off of our AI tools as we produce data. Adaptive Auto-X has components of AI in it as it looks at and behaves throughout the day. So I do think there's greater opportunities foreseeing AI development across the automation suite. But I also think we're seeing low penetration of automation in some key clients. And certainly, when they hear about the successes that some of their peers are making in automation. And obviously, when they hear about the success of a 26-year-old of being the number one trader on MarketAxess, they're going to be interested in that automation suite of products. So we think there's huge demand in '24 for the automation suite and pretty optimistic about what clients can do with it. And as you were asking, the AI solution is indirectly embedded in our automation suite but we think there's more to do and a huge opportunity around AI.
Richard Schiffman: Yes, Michael, I would just throw in on the AI piece. I think the most interesting area where it's going to have an impact is helping to find the other side of the trade, who out of the over 2,000 clients might be interested in what somebody is trading right now because today, everybody has to express their interest either by submitting orders or creating watch list and things. It's a pretty manual process. But if you go on to Amazon, it always seems to know what you might be interested in buying at any given time. I could see AI having an impact that way and being able to notify people when there are things that they could be interested in that they could act on and be on the other side and capture that bid-ask spread. So, things we're looking at pretty closely.
Operator: All right. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Concannon for his closing remarks.
Chris Concannon: Thanks and thank you all for your questions. We look forward to a great 2024. We have lots of innovation, as you heard on the call coming out over the course of the year. We look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. So, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's call. Thanks for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on October 25, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Christa. Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company. Rick Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on how we executed this quarter and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Chris Concannon, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon.
Chris Concannon: Good morning. I'm very pleased to update you on the significant progress we made in the third quarter to enhance our franchise and drive long-term growth. First, in terms of the quarter, we generated revenue of $172 million, earnings per share was $1.46 on net income of $55 million. Our quarterly results were impacted by unusually low levels of credit spread volatility during the seasonally slower summer period. But we are seeing some early positive signs of higher volatility in October. We are not happy with our growth rates in U.S. credit, but we believe we are taking the right steps to improve our growth rates in our business in the years ahead. Turning to my strategic update on Slide 3. We continue to innovate through the launch of our new trading platform, X-Pro. X-Pro delivers our proprietary data for pre-trade analytics and protocol selection. We specifically targeted portfolio trading solutions in X-Pro to address our U.S. high-grade market share challenges. In low volatility market environments, protocols like portfolio trading become more prevalent with portfolio trading rising to 7% of trades during the quarter. Activity on dealer-centric protocols also increases in low volatility markets and we are continuing to focus our growing -- on growing our Mid-X and dealer RFQ protocols. We believe that we have a superior dealer RFQ solution because of our comprehensive Open Trading liquidity. We are pleased to see our portfolio trading clients increasingly leveraging, our unique pre-trade analytics like tradability, only available through X-Pro. 35% of our portfolio trades were executed on X-Pro in October month to date, up from 18% in the third quarter. We continue to deliver unique data and functionality enhancements to our portfolio trading offering in X-Pro. X-Pro integrates our real-time data, our pre-trade analytics, and our trading protocols into a simple trader cockpit that allows the user to seamlessly manage more line items and being more productive. Adaptive Auto-X, a fully automated trader solution provides a suite of sophisticated AI-driven trading algorithms that integrate all of our trading protocols to programmatically improve execution outcomes while reducing market impact. Execution solutions like X-Pro and Adaptive Auto-X allow traders to fully leverage the power of MarketAxess, operating in a far more efficient manner while accessing the best possible liquidity and pricing available in the market. These products answer our clients' growing demand to help them do more with less. Although Adaptive Auto-X was still in pilot phase during the quarter, early results show promising transaction cost savings and reduced market impact in U.S. high grade. Our client franchise has never been stronger with a record of over 2,000 active clients across 67 countries. We delivered strong growth in our international businesses and in municipals. As well as record data revenue as our investments to broaden our geographical and product footprint pay off. We closed the acquisition of Pragma, we integrated the muni-broker platform, and we rolled out Open Trading to several emerging local markets, further solidifying our global leadership in emerging markets e-trading. Slide 4 illustrates how we are integrating our next-gen proprietary data with X-Pro to help traders do more with less. Our unique proprietary data helps clients with their portfolio construction objectives by leveraging liquidity scores, tradability data and our soon-to-be launched matchability data. These data tools can help clients predict the price of a bond, the depth of the market and the likelihood of finding another matching buyer seller on the platform. Our data tools also help clients optimize their protocol selection across RFQ, Open Trading, portfolio trading or automation. Last, with the launch of our AI dealer select data, we can now help inform our clients about their optimal dealer selection based on the bond they are trading. Slide 5 highlights the expansion of our addressable market. Acquisitions totaling approximately $360 million and significant organic investments in new products and protocols over the past several years have expanded our addressable market by an estimated $3 billion across credit, rates, data and post trade. We believe that our acquisition of Pragma will be a key accelerant of our ability to capture this opportunity while enhancing our technology footprint. An expanding market, higher trading velocity, new product expansion and new protocols and workflows are all additional levers of growth that could enhance our addressable market. Slide 6 provides an update on market conditions. Since the end of the third quarter, volatility has continued to move higher, which has benefited ETF market maker activity and U.S. high-yield estimated share. High-yield ETF market maker ADD on our platform is up 94% from the third quarter. With over $7 trillion in global corporate debt set to mature in the next three years, borrowers will have to refinance their debt at much higher rates, creating the potential for higher levels of turnover in the secondary markets. Proposed new additional bank capital requirements could lead to further constraints on bank balance sheets for market making, highlighting the importance of a diverse liquidity pool like Open Trading. Before I turn the call over to Rich Schiffman, I wanted to provide an update on October. Current October trends show high-grade estimated market share and market volumes slightly above September levels. While high-yield estimated share and market volumes are both above September levels. We have five important trading days remaining in the month, and both high-grade and high-yield market share normally show increases in the last week of the month. Additionally, global portfolio trading ADV in October is approximately $770 million, up 77% from Q3 levels. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our market.
Richard Schiffman: Thanks, Chris. We made significant progress this quarter advancing our trading business. Slide 8 highlights the strong expansion of our client network. We had a record 2,093 active client firms trading on our platforms in the third quarter, which included a record 1,625 client firms active in U.S. credit. Trading volume from hedge fund and private bank clients increased 35% year-over-year and represented 17% of total credit market volume in the quarter, up from 13% in the prior year period. A record 1,151 active client firms are trading three or more products on our platforms, reflecting the deep partnership that we have with our clients and the power of our liquidity. We had a record 366 active firms on our municipal bond platform, and we are continuing to integrate muni brokers with Open Trading to expand sources of liquidity for investors and dealers.  On Slide 9, we highlight the growing international diversification of our trading business. Third quarter growth in international average daily trade volume and trade count was 15% and 21%, respectively. This was driven by strong Eurobond trading volume up 18% and emerging local markets trading volume up 27%. The launch of enhancements like U.S. high-grade trading on price has been very well received by our private bank clients, particularly in Europe. Trading volume on Axess IQ, our front end for private banking clients increased 130% in Q3 compared to the prior year. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown on Slide 10. In the third quarter, there were a record 8 million algo responses from dealers, an increase of 41% year-over-year with a three-year CAGR of 30%. Adoption of automated tools continues to increase with our investor clients. We experienced record Auto-X trade volume and count in the quarter with three-year CAGRs of 35% and 41% respectively, and a record 167 active client firms. Auto-X trade volume now represents a record 11% of total credit volume, and trade count was a record 24% of total credit rates. With Adaptive Auto-X, our new suite of client algorithms, we are leveraging our new Open Trading protocols like Live Markets and Auto-Responder to reduce execution costs while increasing the liquidity across our platforms. Historically, traders are responsible for selecting how to engage our comprehensive trading ecosystem. Now they have the ability to use a sophisticated AI-driven algorithm that helps make the decision on the size of the order, the protocol, the counterparty and when to trade. Slide 11 provides an update on Open Trading, our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool. Open Trading ADV is running at $3.8 billion compared to $3.2 billion in Q3, up 19%, reflecting some early positive signs of an increase in volatility. Open Trading share of total credit volume is running well above the 33% reported in the third quarter of 2023. We continue to expand available liquidity by increasing the number of alternative providers. A record 201 hedge funds provided liquidity on Open Trading in the quarter, a 13% increase from the prior year. Open Trading is consistently the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the U.S. credit markets. While price improvement has ticked lower, we have delivered approximately $530 million in cost savings year-to-date. In U.S. high grade, no touch trades executed between Auto-X and a dealer algo represented 21% of trade count on Open Trading. We recently announced the expansion of Open Trading to select emerging local markets, including Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and South Africa. This is a powerful next step in the evolution of our EM franchise, providing global dealers and institutional investors with access to unique onshore liquidity providers. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Gerosa to review our financial performance.
Christopher Gerosa: Thank you, Rich. On Slide 13, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $172 million, in line with prior year. Record Information Services revenue of $12 million was up 22%, this strong performance was driven by the healthy pipeline of new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite. The favorable interest rate environment contributed to $6.6 million of interest income, up from $1.4 million. The effective tax rate was 23.4%, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.46 per share. On Slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue decreased 2% in the quarter, but year-to-date is running 2% above prior year. The decline in credit commission revenue was due to lower estimated U.S. credit market share and lower total credit fee capture partially offset by revenue generated from strong international trading volumes. The lower levels of credit spread volatility during the quarter contributed to a decrease in ETF market making maker activity, which had a negative impact on our U.S. high-yield market share. The reduction in total credit fee capture from prior year was driven principally by the lower duration of U.S. high-grade bonds traded over our platforms and a product mix shift in other credit products, primarily in U.S. high yield. On Slide 15, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses increased 10%, mainly driven by the continued investments in trading system enhancements and our data product offering. Approximately 42% of the increase in operating expenses is due to employee compensation and benefits as we increased headcount 17% to support our revenue growth initiatives. The 15% increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to higher software development costs and acquired intangible amortization expense. Professional and consulting expenses related to M&A were $1.1 million during the quarter and $2.1 million year-to-date. Our operating expense growth rate would have been 7%, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and M&A. On Slide 16, we provide you with our updated full-year 2023 expense guidance. Based on the progress operating expenses and the acquisition of Pragma, the company is refining its previously stated full-year 2023 expense guidance range of $418 million to $446 million to a new range of $432 million to $438 million. Lower variable cost savings from incentive compensation expense and clearing costs was mostly offset by $12.5 million of incremental M&A-related expenses. Excluding M&A-related expenses, our core expense growth rate is expected to be approximately 8%. Our estimated Q4 direct operating expense for Pragma is $8.5 million, which includes acquired intangible amortization expense. For modeling purposes, Pragma's third quarter 2023 total revenue was $6.9 million. On Slide 17, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid with cash and investments totaling $553 million as of September 30 and we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities. On October 2, we purchased Pragma for approximately $129 million, consisting of $81 million in cash and $48 million of stock. We continue to actively invest our cash to take advantage of the favorable interest rate environment to continue to deliver strong net interest income in the coming quarters. During the past 12 months, we paid out approximately $108 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders, and our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 based on the financial performance of the company. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Chris. In summary, on Slide 18, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We are pleased to see some early positive signs of increased volatility, driving higher levels of ETF market maker activity in U.S. high yield and higher levels of Open Trading activity month-to-date. Our client franchise and network has never been stronger with continued diversification across client segments, regions and products. We are making excellent progress with the rollout of X-Pro, powered by our proprietary data, which is increasing trader efficiency while driving better trading outcomes. Portfolio trading on X-Pro is increasing as more clients leverage our enhanced functionality and tradability data. We are not happy with current growth rates in U.S. credit. But as we continue to execute our strategy and the macro backdrop improves, we believe we will be well positioned to deliver higher levels of growth in the quarters ahead. Finally, I would like to welcome Carlos Hernandez back to our Board of Directors. Throughout his career at JPMorgan, Carlos has been forward-thinking about electronic trading and market structure, and we are delighted to have them back on the board. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Citi. Please go ahead.
Christopher Allen: Yes, good morning. Getting a lot of questions myself, just on kind of the October update. Maybe you can help clarify a couple of things. Can you give us some color just in terms of how much of high-yield activities has historically been driven by ETFs. And then from a portfolio trading perspective, it sounds like you're making nice advancements there, particularly into October. But from an overall industry perspective, how is portfolio trading tracking? And what is clearly a more volatile environment?
Chris Concannon: Great. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the questions. Just with regard to the current activity, I think it's important to look at credit spread volatility. Obviously, we do see higher levels of VIX volatility in the market, which has been driving high-yield ETF activity. But when it comes to the credit spread volatility, it remains fairly unchanged from September, high-yield credit volatility is only slightly up. So we're encouraged by the increase in volatility, as I mentioned, high-grade market share is running just slightly above September. Obviously, we have the five remaining days in the month which is a critical part of the month where volumes do increase. And high yield, given that slight increase in volatility is above September levels. And then with regard to portfolio trading, we are seeing our clients leveraging portfolio trading as a protocol. We've seen that grow this year, certainly in the lower ball months that we saw in Q3. We continue to see demand for portfolio trading solutions. And we're continuing to enhance our X-Pro as we roll it out to users. We specifically built X-Pro to target portfolio trading and rolled that out in August. So it's still very early days of our X-Pro for portfolio trading, and we're encouraged by where we stand today. And as I mentioned in the month of October, 35% of our global PTs have been on X-Pro, and that's up from just Q3. But again X-Pro right now it's still early days as we roll out additional enhancements.
Christopher Allen: Thanks. I'll be back in queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Patrick Moley: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had one on expenses. You mentioned in the guide, the $8.5 million of that was related to Pragma. So just wondering if that is maybe a good quarterly run rate to assume in '24 or whether there could potentially be some opportunity for expense synergies or reductions there going forward? Thanks.
Christopher Gerosa: Yes. This is Chris. It's a good run rate for 2024. We're still finalizing the purchase price accounting around that. But the current estimate is roughly $1.5 million of that $8.5 million represents the acquired intangible amortization expense. And so I would expect that to be a decent run rate with modest growth consistent with our core growth for planning a 2024 budget. We're still working through our budget process for '24. But in terms of layering on top of your models, I would assume that's a good run rate for you.
Patrick Moley: All right, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes, hi, good morning everyone. Just following up on the discussion about the operating environment. You made that comment in your September volume release and you've repeated it today that the last week of September was the second best week ever for the company. So maybe you can just remind us what was so good in that week and how that environment has changed so far in October, so we can kind of compare and contrast a little bit here.
Christopher Gerosa: Sure, Alex. Well, obviously, we were pretty excited about that last week of September because we were coming off a quarter of fairly low vol and low volumes. The month was, if you recall, a very large new issue month both in high grade and high yield, and we typically see higher closing monthly -- month end closing activity with regard to the new issue. So there's a higher level of turnover going into that month end of people repositioning some of that new issue bond activity. So there was -- we did see that in September and October. Obviously, new issue is slightly lower. But we typically, in the last five days of the month, the last four days of the month around month end see higher levels of volume in the market, but also MarketAxess experiences slightly higher market share during those periods as well.
Chris Concannon: And I'll just add to that, if you go to the market condition slides, you track the VIX in the upper right, the VIX was really suppressed for most of Q3, and we saw that return of volatility that Chris alluded to, which was a good tailwind for the high-yield volume coming through the platform, and we continue to see that into October. And from a credit fee capture perspective, just reminding everybody that high yield is our highest fee capture product. So the more high-yield volume that comes through, it will naturally elevate our fee capture the bottoms that we experienced in the month of September, where that was trading at roughly $150 per million. And what we're seeing so far in the month of October puts to the $155 million that we had seen for the entirety of Q3.
Alex Kramm: Excellent. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Budish: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on the prior question on Pragma. Chris, you said in your prepared remarks, you think it's going to be a key accelerant of your ability to capture the expanded TAM. I wonder if you could expand on that. And then maybe for Chris, just on terms of modeling for next year, where the revenue is going to be reported? And how should we think about sort of the growth rate of the Q3 number you alluded to earlier? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Great. Thanks, Ben. And obviously, we're pretty excited about the addition of Pragma. We were able to announce and close quite quickly. Pragma is a technology company. That's how most people should think about it. So we are enhancing our tech footprint with very new technology and obviously an algo-driven solution that Pragma brings to us. They have an equity business as well as an FX algo business. So two areas of interest. More importantly, there, we're helping -- they're helping us to enhance our algo offering, Adaptive Auto-X, which we launched this year. So that technology is quite helpful. The other piece of Pragma that we are exploring, we find could be synergistic is their EMS functionality. They have an EMS platform that they license to the NYC and it's quite attractive across multi-assets solution. So we are looking to leverage that EMS platform as well. And then we do think -- given the excitement that we see from our clients around Adaptive Auto-X, and then given some of the excitement from our clients on unique order types that we've been rolling out in our rates platform, we do anticipate higher levels of demand for both automation and algo solutions in both credit and rates growing in the years ahead. So we're excited to have kind of technology, that kind of expertise in-house at MarketAxess as we see just the excitement around our first-ever algo in credit. And obviously, we're seeing levels of demand for algos in rates as well.
Christopher Gerosa: And then on the revenue projections, we're still working through, as I mentioned earlier, the budgeting process for '24. But I called out, the quarterly revenue is roughly around $7 million. So there is that slight drag when you layer in the intangible amortization expense on the total $8.5 million. But I think those two numbers are good numbers used for run rate with a modest growth rate in each line item.
Benjamin Budish: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Daniel Fannon: Thanks, good morning. You mentioned several times the ETF market maker being increased in activity. Can you disclose what percentage of volume they have historically been for you? And then more broadly, are you seeing other parts of the market or other participants starting to pick up in terms of activity as well? You've mentioned volatility, you've mentioned ETF market makers, but I was curious about the breadth of activity beyond those -- or more specifics around that?
Chris Concannon: Sure, Dan. First, our ETF market makers make up about 20% to 25% of that volume. More importantly, we've certainly seen systematic hedge funds that have been during the credit market pickup in activity across both high grade and high yield, but particularly large presence in the U.S. credit market. The overall activity, while volumes are slightly up, the overall activity is across all shapes and sizes of firms, both large investment managers as well as ETF market makers and the hedge fund community. So we are seeing a pickup across all firms. We continue to see portfolio trading used as a solution across our largest clients. We're seeing more and more international clients using portfolio trading solutions as well. So again, multiprotocol selection is definitely the theme. The other theme that's critically important is our clients are not adding traders. They are consistently asking us to deliver technology solutions that solves workflow efficiencies for them, because they are not adding traders. And so all of it if you look at the theme of what we're rolling out from a technology perspective, it's really allowing traders to do more with less, consistently more with less and that's the feedback that we're getting from our clients.
Daniel Fannon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on X-Pro. If you can talk a little bit about the timing of the rollout, I think I want to say the last data point was 30 or so clients, I believe, are using it, if that's still a valid number or if you can talk about how that -- how you expect that to grow? And then in terms of the portfolio trading, I think you said 7%, Chris, was the share of TRACE, and then I missed the comment on October. I know that increased a lot. But if you could just talk about -- reiterate that and what portion of portfolio trading share you have of that 7% now and how you expect that to improve from X-Pro?
Richard Schiffman: Hey, Brian, it's Rich here. You can talk about the X-Pro adoption and it's been going great. We've got it up now over a 100 firms active and 180 traders on it. As Chris noted earlier, we've been focused quite a bit on our most active PT or portfolio trading users because the productivity gains for them are particularly pronounced. It's also out there for those doing large list tending to trade with a lot of small trades, X-Pro really is outstanding in that way, because it's easier to manipulate large numbers, in large list, in large portfolios things of that sort. So we're going to continue with that emphasis. It's the big push on PT, at our most active users with lots -- large numbers of tickets. And we expect this type of adoption to continue at this kind of pace should be growing pretty rapidly.
Chris Concannon: And just on the portfolio trading overall market, obviously, 7% of trades for portfolio trading is above historical averages of closer to 5%. So we are seeing higher levels of portfolio trading, but that's typical in lower volatility environments. We did what I mentioned in my opening remarks, portfolio trading ADV, global portfolio trading ADV for us in October was up 77%. Within the U.S., our market share is now just over 20% of the PT market. And then our U.S. portfolio volumes, portfolio trading volumes are up over 20% from our Q3 level. So we continue to see more penetration. We are -- as Rich mentioned, we're leading with the X-Pro platform. It is a convenient tool for our portfolio trader given the number of line items you can manage and all the pre-trading analytics that it delivers. And then overall, on X-Pro, the rollout, we're rolling out slowly and carefully because there's a great deal of training that we do with traders. We're only at 183 traders of over 10,000 traders. So it's still early days, only 4% of our credit volume in the U.S. is coming through X-Pro today. So still early days. One important trend that we've seen, we've targeted both portfolio of traders as well as what we call our power users. And we've actually, among our power users, we've seen a 20% increase in volume from those power users when comparing them on the old platform. So it does deliver higher efficiencies to the individual trader when they are sitting in that trading tool.
Brian Bedell: That's great color. Thank you so much.
Chris Concannon: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.
Simon Clinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to take a step back again and just look at the broader environment. And I was just pondering over the idea of the credit spread volatility being low. But when you look back historically, it looks like it's actually low quite a lot of the time and you get these periods of significant spike. And given that auto trading really delivers value during those periods of elevated credit spread volatility. I was just wondering if there's -- how you think about the progression of all-to-all trading and Open Trading penetration. And whether portfolio trading because volatility tends to be below average for more of the time, where the portfolio trading could actually be quite a bit larger than 7% of the volumes that we see today?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Great question. Well, first, when it comes to all-to-all trading and Open Trading, there's a very important dynamic called the Network effect that Open Trading delivers. And we are seeing alternative liquidity providers entering the market globally across U.S. credit, Eurobonds as well as EM. So we continue to see new alternative liquidity providers entering the market. We also, if you think about the dynamics and the enhancements that we're adding to our marketplace, we're allowing our clients to be providers of liquidity. Adaptive Auto-X, our algo solution and a key ingredient to that is allowing clients to quietly enter the market, both on the passive side, meaning being a liquidity provider as well as on the aggressive side. So we are growing the all-to-all network across all our products. So you can't look at it as a static offering today. It continues to expand globally. It does have spikes of activity during higher vol, obviously. And those -- we have seen those in the past. The one other important thing to mention when we're thinking out longer term, the regulatory landscape is constantly changing. And right now, we continue to hear from globally on enhancing bank capital rules. And those proposals that are out there are tightening bank capital rules, and we heard from one very large bank recently in their earnings call. Mentioned that it could tighten capital rules by as much as 20%, which would obviously impact dealer liquidity in the U.S. in credit globally. And so those -- the importance of alternative liquidity solutions will gain over time if those bank capital rules continue to tighten. Rich, do you want to add anything?
Richard Schiffman: Yes, Simon, I was just kind of add to that. It's about two things that our clients are looking for and what PT delivers in particular is workflow efficiencies. And it's quite similar to the workflow gains that came when list trading was first introduced over 20 years ago. It's much easier to do that collection of bonds all at one time. And now add to that the guaranteed execution that typically comes with the PT to have it all done in one shot. What is missing is the other part that the investor clients are typically looking for, which is execution cost reduction and getting high quality execution from that. That's where the open trading comes in. And it is on us to work and come up with the solutions that combine those two things. Just having PT, which works great in the low volatility environment. But when the market gets a lot choppier, it becomes a much more expensive trait. And we know that our clients are looking for both of those characteristics from us. So the focus is on trying to deliver both of those things simultaneously. And with that, we think that's going to build our business and grow our market share.
Simon Clinch: Great. Appreciate that answer. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. I'm going to try to squeeze in a two part question on pricing. Historically, there hasn't been much or any transaction pricing pressure in the industry. And it seems like there's still a really wide and unique moat around Open Trading due to your liquidity pool and that network effect you just mentioned in the prior question. But with respect to protocols where there may be somewhat less differentiation on liquidity, is pricing becoming even a small part of client decisions on where to trade for protocols like PT or standard RFQ trading? So that's the first part of the question. Second part of that question is really has to do with -- do you think any of your clients are becoming sophisticated enough to RFQ out to all platforms where pricing may be already impacting where they execute orders if the cover price the same across those platforms?
Chris Concannon: Great. On pricing, obviously, we don't see a lot of pricing pressure across our market globally. In fact, we've seen competitors like Bloomberg introducing pricing where they were free in the past. So we have seen unique price increases across the competitive landscape in certain protocols, pricing, as you mentioned, certain protocols that are more workflow functionality and less unique to the liquidity that you're bringing together. We've seen fairly static pricing. So we haven't seen price competition hit there. Again, clients, if you think about this universe we operate in, it's largely a dealer pay model. So the clients are less price sensitive and more focused on workflow solution, ultimately getting execution at higher levels, better pricing, better liquidity. We do not see clients are at queuing across multiple platforms with the same RFQ. In fact, that's problematic. And we -- if we see that type of behavior, we obviously need to control for that behavior because it creates really a request for price that ultimately falls on one platform and is not honored. So we do regulate that. We are -- we do pay attention to that. And I think our clients have been quite professional about that type of behavior. Rich, anything to add?
Richard Schiffman: Yes. Kyle, I'll just add to Chris' comments on the fees and things that come up there. We price our service commensurate with the value that's delivered with it. And you're aware of that in the fee schedule, there's -- for example, high yield, where it's $0.03 to $0.06 or Open Trading, where we have our highest fees that we're charging where we think we're delivering the most value to our clients. The individual performance to what we call price improvement from Open Trading that comes, right now, we're at lows where it's just shy of 2 basis points in high grade, and it's about $0.28 in the last quarter in high yield. Those price improvements or execution cost savings, that's net of the fees that we charge. So when it comes to the decision for where someone is going to trade, where you can get that type of performance, additional quality of execution, net of the fees that we're charging, it's a pretty easy decision about where to send the inquiries. So if there's a competing platform where the actual transaction fee is a little bit smaller, we're talking about tens of basis points or a couple of cents compared to the performance that gets delivered when Open Trading wins. And as I noted before, we're the large liquidity provider on the platform in these products, then the decision is pretty straightforward for the investors. And that's a message that we're continually reminding our clients about.
Kyle Voigt: Very thorough. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask on portfolio trading. You guys continue to show momentum there, growing volumes meaningfully. I was hoping you might be able to unpack how much of the portfolio trading volume is coming across in IG versus in high yield? Any notable differences that you're seeing? And as you look out, is there one area where you see a bigger opportunity with portfolio trading?
Chris Concannon: Sure. First of all, we're seeing growing demand for portfolio trading. It's such a convenient workflow solution particularly when our clients are getting large inflows, it's obviously a very easy way to get exposure quite quickly. The other method that we have seen clients use are just using outright fixed income ETFs to get that exposure and then unwinding the ETF and going into the underlying. We do see portfolio trading globally. As I mentioned, we're seeing some of our global clients using portfolio trading. And many times, they're trading a global list, not just a U.S. high-grade or U.S. high-yield credit list. So we do see that offering growing over time. And obviously, the tools that our clients are using, remember this -- when this portfolio trading was born, it was born on Excel spreadsheet. So we've come a long way. The real -- we think the real solution that our clients now are looking for is once they think they have a portfolio trade, so either they're buying a very large portfolio where they're selling a portfolio or their switching, they need to optimize that portfolio if they construct it, meaning they can truly impact the price of the portfolio by picking certain bonds in the portfolio deselecting or adding bonds. And our tool helps them with that portfolio construction and it does, in fact, optimize their pricing, which is quite helpful. And it's really the pre-trade analytics that drives that portfolio construction and that bond selection once you load the overall portfolio trade that you intend on using. But to answer your question, the PT volumes, it's largely weighted towards investment grade with about 70% in investment grade and only about 15% in high yield. And many times, we see portfolios across both high-grade and high-yield. We would expect to see growing portfolios in Europe and in Asia as well, again, using EM or across global bond less as well. And that's an offering that we recently put out our global PT offering. Traders were asking for really a global list of bonds to trade as a portfolio.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alexander Blostein: I wanted to ask you guys a question around just the expense management philosophy and margin trajectory. When you look at the revenue backdrop, obviously, has been challenged. And Chris, you mentioned you guys have been disappointed with how U.S. credit has performed and part of that environmental part of it is, I guess, the mix. But as you look at the expense growth, I think you suggested 8% core expense growth in 2023 ex-kind of some of the deal noise. Is that sort of the appropriate run rate for the business if revenue growth will improve maybe somewhat but doesn't necessarily get back to the levels it used to be. And are there levers you could pull to get the company back to positive operating leverage or that's really just going to be a function of mostly revenues and less selling expenses?
Chris Concannon: Yes. So Alex, as you know, we've made a lot of investments over the last three years. Chris alluded to the number of M&A activity, which contributed to the elevated levels of acquired intangibles amortization expense. So that provides for a little bit of noise, and we've built the teams out where it's all come together this year from a core perspective where we're rolling out X-Pro, we're rolling out the final suite of our automation tools with the Adaptive Auto-X solution. So where we stand today, we're thinking of -- the future is that high single-digit expense growth rate for the core business, recognizing that roughly 17% to 18% of our operating expenses are variable. And we've experienced some savings due to the underperformance that we have seen this year, where our variable expenses were more or less down roughly $12 million to $13 million from what we were planning for in the beginning of the year, and that more or less was offset by the $12.5 million of M&A-related expenses. So I would say that the levers are built into the model through the variable expenses. But as we think about our expense philosophy internally, we're redirecting and reallocating resources to the top priorities where we think we're going to get near-term revenue growth prospects.
Richard Schiffman: And Alex, I would just mention we're laser focused on expenses right now. We're also in a critical period for the company where we are introducing new technology across our tech stack. So that requires higher levels of investment, and that's what we've been doing. So when you look at that expense growth, we are covering both the legacy platform and the new platform at the same time. And obviously, acquisitions like Pragma enhance that technology footprint as well. So, but these models are designed to be highly leveraged. And I think, Alex, you cover a number of companies that have great operating leverage in their system, and we look to grow that over time. One important point is that market data revenue. Remember, data is just an output. It doesn't really cost anything more to produce other than the sophistication of the data that you're producing. And we see that data, our market data, as you saw in the quarter, grew over 20%, and that will help us grow our operating margin as that data revenue piece continues to grow. And again, the data that we're rolling out now on X-Pro is not data for sale today, but could be for sale in the future. It's really designed to grow our market share across the various products that we are trading. And so we're going to be leveraging that data as a way to collect orders in the bond market. And over time, we'll be able to leverage that data into hard dollars as well.
Alexander Blostein: Got it. Thanks for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Good morning. The innovations that you've been speaking to today potentially allow MarketAxess to [Technical Difficulty] block trade market?
Chris Concannon: I'm sorry, Patrick, you broke up a little bit. What was the last part of that question?
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: What's the [Technical Difficulty] about help you better penetrate the block trade market?
Chris Concannon: Okay, block trade. So first, in EM, particularly around our local market growth, we are seeing higher levels of block activity. We have been growing our block market share there. We have rolled out a request for market, which is an important protocol that a number of clients have requested that tends to introduce the opportunity for a higher block activity. And then with the rollout of our X-Pro platform, we are introducing what we call high touch solutions in November in this quarter in the fourth quarter. And obviously, hopefully see an uptake in 2024, but that high-touch offering is really designed to attract larger order sizes that need to use pre-trade analytics to decide on protocol selection. One key ingredient to that is our AI Dealer Select data, which helps you select one to however many dealers you would choose. When you're managing a larger size order, you obviously want to reduce the market impact and the information leakage of that order. So our new offering in X-Pro would help you decide, number one, what protocol can -- is there levels of liquidity using things like tradability to go into an all-to-all market where you're requesting price from the entire market, or if you're looking at lower levels of tradability, you may want to use a number of dealers, discrete dealers, and then if you choose to only use dealers, you would want to know which dealers you should select from. So that offering is really targeted launch in November, but really hopeful to see it on client desktops across the first quarter of '24.
Richard Schiffman: Hey, Patrick. It's Rich. And one other thing, we're talking about adaptive and Adaptive Auto-X and it's, again, still early days just coming out of the pilot phase, but even from the small number of clients that we have in this initial phase, we're seeing larger orders coming from it. So remember, it gives the ability to tap into the different protocols that we have available. So a common type of operation in the algo is to leave part of a block order resting in the order book. And then when other parties engage being able to then work that order up to a larger size that gets completed, we call that multiparty workup. And we've seen some encouraging early examples of that being used where the initial trade starts out at $500 million or $1 million or a couple of million and we've had cases where it gets worked up to $15 million or $20 million. And that's all done quietly without showing full size initially. People are concerned about that information leakage, and then quietly working that up to a larger size without the information leakage. So we expect to see greater adoption of that as the Adaptive Auto-X rollout expands.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Citi. Please go ahead.
Chris Concannon: Hey, Chris.
Operator: Chris, your line is open.
Christopher Allen: Sorry, guys. I had in a mute. Just wanted to ask where you guys in the hiring cycle with FTEs up 17% year-over-year, you're kind of at the end of that cycle. Do you expect prime to basically afford any expense efficiency opportunities longer term?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Obviously, the hiring cycle was quite high over the last few years, quite a competitive market that we entered in '22 and into the first quarter of '23. With the layoffs among the large investment banks and across the technology companies that market dynamic has reduced. So it's a much more friendly hiring environment. We are obviously focused on rolling out products and rolling out solutions and Pragma brings with us probably around 50 technologists, which is a great add to the overall footprint of MarketAxess. And we just see going into 2024, we're quite comfortable with the hiring marketplace. And obviously, the addition of heads that we've already added to the overall footprint of MarketAxess. And then more importantly, we have a number of things that we're doing on the tech side of re-platforming our platform, rolling out X-Pro and continuing to grow the overall automation solutions. So we continue to see sizable investments in all of those tech plants and all of those opportunities.
Christopher Allen: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. Chris Concannon, I will turn the call to you for closing remarks.
Chris Concannon: Great. Well, thank you for joining us today. Obviously, we have a very important quarter ahead and are pretty excited about the levels of activity and the number of things that we're rolling out in this quarter and the quarters ahead. So thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you in another quarter.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on July 20, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company and provide color on the market outlook; Rich Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on our market and how we executed this quarter; and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Chris Concannon, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. I would also direct you read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon.
Chris Concannon: Good morning. I’m very pleased to update you on the significant progress we made in the second quarter to enhance our franchise and drive our long-term growth. First, in terms of the quarter, we generated revenue of $180 million and year-to-date we generated $383 million, 4% above prior year levels. Earnings per share was $1.59 on net income of $60 million. We were not immune to the impact of dramatically lower volatility in the quarter, which impacted trading platforms across fixed income and other asset classes after a very strong first quarter. While our quarterly results will ebb and flow with volatility, we are confident that we have the right long-term strategy and we have made substantial progress this quarter in creating the most comprehensive global fixed income market for the future. Turning to my strategic update, as you can see on Slide 3, we will now be providing quarterly updates based on 3 new focus areas, which is the framework through which we are managing our growth and how we will communicate our results going forward. First, in terms of innovation, we have now developed and launched unique proprietary data solutions and embedded them in our platform that we believe will help our clients make better trading decisions that achieve better outcomes. We have also launched the first client algorithm, Adaptive Auto-X in the U.S. credit markets with 8 live pilot clients and plans to increase the numbers significantly in the coming months. Next, in terms of integration, we successfully launched our new trading platform last quarter, which integrates our unique data products and our various trading protocols in a single platform. Contained in that new trading platform is our enhanced portfolio trading functionality with increased capacity for large portfolios and accompanied by our proprietary data analytics that help our clients optimize their portfolios and protocol selections. And last, in terms of execution, we continue to expand our client franchise with record active clients, record traders and record active clients trading three or more products. We continue to grow and set records across various products and new initiatives, and we delivered on our new trading platform, an enhanced portfolio trading solution, and we processed a record single day of trading activity on May 31. In summary, we continued to execute in the quarter, despite the decrease in volatility which dampened activity on our platform. The initiatives we launched this quarter will be critical in addressing the recent challenges we have faced in growing our estimated market share in U.S. high-grade. While we recognize that our high grade market share can be uniquely impacted by volume and volatility in the ETF markets, we also have felt the impact of new protocols like portfolio trading slowing our market share growth. Slide 4 illustrates how we are innovating with unique proprietary data that powers our new platform and our automation suite. We sit in a privileged position as a leader of the electronic global credit market that generates powerful proprietary data. This proprietary data helps inform our clients on what to trade to achieve their portfolio construction objectives by leveraging our Liquidity Scores, Tradability data and our new Matchability data. Our unique data like CP Inquiry, CP+ Responder and Tradability, also informs clients how to trade and when to trade by recommending the right protocol to get their best price, how to size their trade, how to reduce their market impact, and informing them what to expect in terms of price outcome. And last, our newly released AI Dealer Direct Data helps inform our clients, who to trade with by leveraging artificial intelligence to determine the best counterparty for a specific trade. On Slide 5, our new trading platform will drive the gathering and directing of client orders to achieve better trading outcomes for clients. We are delivering a high-touch and low-touch trading solutions through our new order centric trading platform powered by our proprietary data and analytics. We started our broad rollout in the first quarter of this year, and early client feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We have transitioned over 30 of our top investor clients, who are now using the platform daily. Turning to Slide 6, our unique data and insights are also powering the first client algorithm, Adaptive Auto-X, designed to better link our liquidity pools. Our Adaptive Auto-X algorithms allow clients to build customized trading algorithms and enhance workflows to handle larger sized trades. Adaptive Auto-X also leverages smart order routing, so we can seamlessly link our liquidity pools and help our clients achieve unique execution outcomes. Slide 7 highlights the expanded addressable market that we have established compared to 2018. The product set that we had in 2018 gave us access to a total addressable market of approximately $4 billion in revenue. The investments that we have made over the last several years have expanded our total addressable market by $3 billion, for a total addressable market today of $7 billion. We are continuing to invest to capture the tremendous opportunity before us, while integrating the new initiatives we have acquired or built. Slide 8 provides an update on market conditions and U.S. credit. As shown in the upper half of this slide, volatility in the second quarter was down significantly from the prior year impacting activity by select client segments on our platform. ETF market maker activity in the second quarter was down 47% from the first quarter, reflecting decreased opportunities to deploy arbitrage strategies. In the second quarter, notional volumes and high grade and high yield ETFs decreased 19% and 33%, respectively, compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of reduced volatility on U.S. credit. The decrease in volatility was not unique to fixed income, with realized volatility on the S&P 500 down 52%, FX volatility down 12%, and commodities down 28%. Before I turn the call over to Rich Schiffman, I wanted to provide an update on market trends in July. With 8 important trading days remaining in the month, U.S. high grade estimated market share is running consistent with mid-June levels. U.S. high yield estimated market share, however, has rebounded and is now running above June levels and slightly below prior year July levels. Now, let me turn the call over to Rich Schiffman to provide you with an update on our market.
Richard Schiffman: Thanks, Chris. Slide 10 highlights the strength of our growing client franchise. We had a record 2,083 active client firms trading on our market in the second quarter. As an example of our global strength and diversity, active international client firms represent 51% of total active firms, and the over 5,000 international investor and dealer traders, represent over 40% of total active traders. Trading volume from hedge fund and private bank clients increased 36% year-over-year and represented 17% of total credit volume in the current quarter, up from 12% in the prior year period. A record 1,127 active client firms are trading 3 or more products on our market, which reflects the deep partnership that we have with our clients and the power of our liquidity. Once clients make the investment to connect to our platform, they want to do more with us, leveraging the power of our market to achieve superior trading results. This reflects the stickiness of MarketAxess in the workflow of our clients. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown here on Slide 11. What Chris described earlier is playing out exactly as we had expected. Automation tools are only as good as the data that informs and powers the algorithm. Given the breadth of activity on our market, we believe our CP+ data is more accurate than that of our competitors. This is validated by CP+ sales growth over the last several quarters. In the second quarter, there were a record $7.4 million algo responses from dealers, an increase of 31% year-over-year with a 3-year CAGR of 28%. Adoption of automated tools continues to increase with our investor clients. Once again, we saw record Auto-X trade volume and count in the quarter, with 3-year CAGRs of 32% and 43%, respectively, and a record 146 active client firms leveraging our automation tools. Of these active clients, 32% are top 100 clients in terms of total credit trading volume. Auto-X inquiry sizes are rising, as clients become more comfortable with automation and dealers are increasingly using their algos to handle larger size trades. It’s common for us to see clients start out small and then raise their thresholds as they gain confidence in our services. Responding to client interest, we’ve been steadily raising the maximum automation size, which currently sits at $10 million. Auto-X trade volume now represents a record 10% of total credit volume and trade count is a record 23% of total credit trades. We believe that Adaptive Auto-X, our new suite of investor client algorithms, will take our automation solutions to a new level by leveraging smart order routing to facilitate access to the MarketAxess ecosystem. Slide 12 provides an update on Open Trading, our market leading all-to-all liquidity pool. Despite the dramatically lower credit spread volatility in the quarter, which reduced price improvement measures, we continue to expand available liquidity with new alternative providers. A record 195 hedge funds provided liquidity on Open Trading in the quarter, an 18% increase from the prior year. The increased alternative liquidity on Open Trading is being driven by better data, which allows hedge funds and systematic investors to deploy trading strategies they have developed in other asset classes. One of the key drivers of our very strong increase in estimated market share for Eurobonds is the enhanced liquidity offered through Open Trading. We achieved record Eurobond trade volume in the quarter and a record 31% Eurobond Open Trading share. In U.S. high grade, no touch trades executed between Auto-X and a dealer algo represented 19% of trade count in high grade on Open Trading, reflecting the increasing usage of automation tools in leveraging our unique liquidity pool. On Slide 13, we highlight the growing international diversification of our trading business. Second quarter growth in international average daily trade volume and trade count increased 14% and 28%, respectively. This was driven by record Eurobond ADV, up 30% and EM local markets volume, up 11%. June month end was extremely strong for EM local trading with a record of over US$5 billion equivalent volume traded. This contributed to our second best day on the platform. It included two of our largest trades ever on our market, both around $300 million in size. From a regional perspective, LatAm generated record ADV in the quarter and the second best quarter in terms of revenue. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris Gerosa to review our financial performance.
Christopher Gerosa: Thank you, Rich. On Slide 15, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $180 million, down slightly from the prior year. Record information services revenue of $12 million, was up 24%. This strong performance was driven by the healthy pipeline of new contracts signed, as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite. Based on the year-to-date progression of information services revenue, we expect to achieve full year revenue growth in the mid-teens. The effective tax rate was 24.2%, slightly lower than prior year, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.59 per share. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange losses and unrealized losses on U.S. Treasury investments in the quarter and the impact of foreign exchange gains in the prior year quarter, all of which are included in other come, diluted EPS would have been down 3% versus the reported 11% decline. On Slide 16, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and fee capture. Total commission revenue decreased 3% in the quarter and year-to-date is running 3% above prior year levels. Total credit commission revenue was impacted by the dramatically low levels of volatility in the quarter, which reduced trading activity, negatively impacting our trading volumes and estimated U.S. credit market share. This was partially offset by the revenue generated from strong market share gains in Eurobonds, Emerging Markets and Munis. The reduction in total credit fee capture from prior year was driven principally by the lower duration of U.S. high grade bonds traded over our platform. Product mix shift in other credit products, primarily in U.S. high yield and client crossing activity in Eurobonds, which is executed at a lower fee capture rate. While U.S. high grade fee capture declined year-over-year, duration has remained relatively stable over the last several months, as reflected in the corporate bond duration index. On Slide 17, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Second quarter expenses increased 7%, driven principally by continued investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Employee compensation and benefits increased $3 million on a 17% increase in headcount, as we continue to add technology and customer facing roles to support revenue growth initiatives. Tech and communications expenses increased $3 million due to higher SaaS, data center and cloud hosting expenses. On Slide 18, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid with cash and investments totaling $506 million and we had no outstanding debt as of June 30. We are actively investing our cash to take advantage of the favorable interest rate environment to continue to deliver strong net interest income in the coming quarters. During the past 12 months, we paid out approximately $107 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a regularly quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 based on the financial performance of the company. Now, let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.
Chris Concannon: In summary, on Slide 19, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We have launched unique proprietary data solutions and embedded them in our new platform that we believe will help our clients make better trading decisions that achieve better outcomes. We have launched the first client algorithm, Adaptive Auto-X in the U.S. credit markets. We successfully developed and launched our new trading platform, which integrates our unique data products and our various trading protocols in a single platform. We continue to expand our global client franchise and we believe that we are entering a new period of growth in fixed income with higher rates that we expect will make fixed income a very attractive asset class in the years ahead. Now, we would be happy to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christopher Allen: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about Adaptive Auto-X, maybe you can give us a rough timeline in terms of expectations for a broader rollout of the platform, I know, you have 8 live pilot clients and you had your first trade on it. And then maybe you can provide a refresher just in terms of how do you think that’s going to impact client execution quality and the potential cost savings for clients? And how that translates into improved performance longer term?
Chris Concannon: Great. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for that question. Obviously, Adaptive Auto-X is in early stages, as we mentioned, it’s still in pilot. It will remain in pilot through the remainder of the summer. And based on early indications, performance is quite attractive. And as expected, the key thing about Adaptive is it allows a client to submit a larger parent order, which then breaks into what we call child orders, and those orders can be placed across various different protocols. The other unique thing about Adaptive Auto-X, it is pegged to the market, meaning, you can choose your relative price and it will remain pegged to the market and reprice as the market moves throughout the morning or the day. As we mentioned, we have 8 clients in pilot with probably another 3 or 4 in the queue. All of various shapes and sizes. Some of them are quite large clients, traditional asset managers and some are a number of smaller hedge funds. So we’re trying to do a broad cross section just to complete your question around the performance of Adaptive Auto-X and the goals it’s really to allow clients to outsource their trading strategies into really a very sophisticated AI-driven algorithm. And the unique thing about Adaptive Auto-X and end MarketAxess is that it takes advantage of our Open Trading solutions, both our live markets order book as well as our all-to-all Open Trading solution in RFQ. So it allows clients to actually not cross spread for some portion of their order, which is a substantial improvement in price given the size of spreads in our market. So it’s a very unique offering that leverages our competitive position in all-to-all trading, that huge liquidity pool that we always talk about Open Trading. Adaptive Auto-X is uniquely designed around that solution. And then, obviously, we plan to roll that out over the course of the fall and into next year. The client feedback thus far has been very positive. We have a number of clients begging to be in the pilot, but we’re trying to keep the pilot at this point small. The other important thing and we rolled out a number of new data products. There’s one product in particular, when combined with Adaptive Auto-X makes it a much more interesting opportunity and that’s called matchability. And matchability predicts the opportunity of a specific bond to find a matching buyer or seller on our platform. So that combined with Adaptive Auto-X’s increases a client’s likelihood of not crossing spread by being very careful about their bond selection when they’re building their portfolio.
Richard Schiffman: Chris, can I just add to this? Chris, it’s Richard Schiffman here. And just to address the question about execution quality and building on what Chris just said here, it’s really exciting to see what’s going on in the pilot, because this was an example of one of the trades, where we had something that would have been a traditional RFQ and a liquidity taker, paying bid-ask spread and getting quite competitive execution quality on our system. But because they used Adaptive Auto-X, they were able to leave their order resting in our order book live markets, when then someone else came along and executed against them. So as Chris pointed out, crossing bid-ask spread, it’s tying together the different protocols that we have that historically have kind of sat by themselves. And we left it up to traders on the system to have to go manually to each of the different protocols to take advantage of them. So that was really the most exciting thing, seeing this work across the protocols. I think we had one execution that was done three different ways, both on live markets as a provider of liquidity and then the remainder done as an RFQ, all done automatically through Adaptive Auto-X.
Christopher Allen: Thanks, guys. I hop back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Just wondering if I could ask a question on recent trends in the high grade business, it seemed that really from 4Q 2021 through May of this year, you had stabilized market share trends versus your largest U.S. competitor, especially as you had fully rolled out a PT offering of your own. However, in June specifically, we’ve again seen some share loss in U.S. high grade versus that peer. Just wondering what has driven that recently in high grade and are you hearing anything from clients that would suggest there is any pure customer switching occurring of kind of standard RFQ or even OT activity?
Chris Concannon: Sure, happy to address. Thanks for the question. Obviously, across our other competitive products, things like high yield, EM and Eurobonds, we continue to see share growth over the quarters and certainly over the years, and those are products that are offered in a competitive environment as well. High grade seems to be a unique area, where we’ve bumped into our share growth challenges and particularly around portfolio trading, as I mentioned in our opening remarks. We’ve certainly seen portfolio trading grow within the market. It’s now somewhere between 5% and 6% of the overall market and that has grown over the past couple of years. We are hearing from clients that they are using portfolio trading for workflow solutions, so they are able to move large amounts of investment flows in and out of their portfolio through a very seamless one-time trade or one price trade. We see portfolio trading happening direct with dealers, even over Excel spreadsheets, we see happening in the competitive environment. And then, obviously, we’re talking to our clients regularly on. What are their needs for portfolio trading on our platform? We are just now rolling out a number of enhancements to our portfolio trading platform, we’ve rolled out on our new platform that we talked about earlier, a brand new enhanced portfolio trading tool that expands the number of line items clients can trade. It also, more importantly, embed our unique data, tradability data, which is an important data product that we rolled out that helps clients not only trade the portfolio and determine price of that portfolio, but clients are trying to figure out what should be in their portfolio before they do a portfolio trade. We see clients more often than not amending their portfolio, adjusting the line items in that portfolio to improve price or to choose the right protocol, and they’re using our tradability data as a line by line solution to help them build that portfolio before making that portfolio trade and optimizing price. So we’re feeling very good and very positive about our new portfolio trading enhancements, and we have a number of enhancements that are rolling out in August and throughout the course of the fall.
Richard Schiffman: Yeah, Kyle, it’s Rich. I was just going to add a couple of things about it. Also, the current environment, which is pretty low volatility, as Chris pointed out earlier, there’s not a big premium being paid to get the PTs done that way. So there’s no question there’s been a bit of shift in some of that activity. We’re picking up PT business also, although, maybe not growing as fast as the overall amount taking place, we are fully invested in it and making sure that we’ve got the most competitive product out there in the market, particularly around the usability in terms of the workflow, making sure it’s very easy. The work in our new trading platform is very much geared around the PT workflow and making sure that that goes smoothly. And, in particular, longer term, this is one thing we’re quite focused on, is looking for ways to morph PTs and traditional in comp list business, so that we give traders at the point of execution when they’re going out, which is the better way to execute this trade. Should I go in comp list? Should I go PT? It’s going to vary depending upon what they’re trading, what’s going on in the market at that time. But PT, it’s a pretty concentrated business in terms of liquidity provision. I think, there’s maybe half a dozen, or eight, or so firms that are active in it and it’s quite concentrated with half that number, if that. And to forego all of the broad liquidity in the market from over 1,000 liquidity providers that we have seems an unfortunate thing to do. So that’s kind of on our long-term roadmap with PT is look for ways how we can bring that broad liquidity together with the benefits of the portfolio trading workflow.
Kyle Voigt: Thanks, Rich. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Budish: Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to kind of follow back a little bit on Chris’s question from earlier, just in terms of the kind of early reads from Adaptive Auto-X and thinking about Rich, some of your comments on auto exiting the trade sizes increase. I guess, for Adaptive Auto-X, do you think this is going to be a kind of quicker solution to seeing trade size increase? Or is it perhaps more like what you’re seeing with your Auto-X product? You expect traders to kind of get more comfortable and over time they start putting in larger and larger tickets. So, yeah, any kind of early reads from the behavior you’re seeing from your clients and pilot?
Richard Schiffman: Yeah. Thanks, Benjamin, for the question. I think, we’re going to see larger volumes coming through on it, but it might not necessarily be reflected in larger tickets, because part of what the benefit of Adaptive Auto-X is, this ability to really easily breakup a large inquiry or order into smaller pieces and get quality execution at an average price across those executions. So, I think, it will be a tool for attracting these larger orders into the system, although the actual executions of them might happen in relatively smaller pieces.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Patrick Moley: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, earlier this month, maybe late last month, there was a large liquidity provider market maker out there that was talking about wanting to become more involved in the U.S. credit market. So just wondering what your thoughts are on some of these larger players leaning into credit, maybe what it means for automation and maybe what it means for your Adaptive Auto-X tool more specifically. Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Sure. Great question. And, obviously, from a macro perspective, it’s quite positive that everyone is looking at the fixed income market as an attractive environment for the coming years with yields at these levels, obviously, the Fed is contemplating another quarter point rate hike next week. And, obviously, if the Fed halts rate hikes next week that’s certainly going to be very positive for fixed income investing. And even BlackRock recently predicted a surge in fixed income investments once the Fed stop raising rates. So the overall macro environment is quite attractive for the fixed income market and, certainly, credit, in particular. The new entrants of the most recent, I think, there was a story in the FT about Citadel joining the credit markets as a liquidity provider. It’s really a trend that we’re seeing, obviously, Citadel is a very large player across many different asset classes, and their entrance is a very important sign of things to come. We are also seeing other entrants, particularly out of the ETF market maker groups, entering the credit markets as well. And we certainly offer a unique offering with all-to-all trading, where you can have a new entrant, join the market and join a network of 2,000 clients around the globe. So the ability for that new entry to step into the market is quite powerful here, but they all are entering with a strong bend towards electronic trading. Obviously, Citadel is known for its electronic trading prowess, and the other ETF market makers and systematic hedge funds that we’re seeing enter our market are all leveraging very advanced trading technology, which makes a very attractive outcome for things like our overall automation suite, including the Adaptive Auto-X launch.
Patrick Moley: Excellent. So I hop back in the queue.
Chris Concannon: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.
Simon Clinch: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Actually I got a question about the data side and perhaps CP+, and just could you expand on the opportunities for monetizing your proprietary data set, which is significant and, I think, still quite early stage? And just how we should think about the size of that opportunity, the timing of that really flowing through into your business?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Great question. And we love to talk about our data here at MarketAxess. Just to put it in perspective, the addressable market that I spoke about, about $1 billion of that addressable market is data revenue. So we are very bullish on the opportunity in the data space. Our data revenues have been consistently growing as a result of the demand for CP+, our real time data. It’s a strong data product in the U.S. for U.S. corporate bonds. Obviously, we think it’s the benchmark for real time trading of U.S. corporate bonds. But, more importantly, in Eurobonds and EM, we’re seeing high demand, particularly in EM, which is a much more difficult market to trade. We see high demand for CP+ across those international markets. And as we grow our trading footprint, and we did grow our trading footprint both in Eurobonds and EM, that data product becomes that much more valuable. So we’re certainly projecting very attractive growth rates for CP+ internationally as well as here. With regard to the proprietary data products and I named a number of them that are newly into production and being launched over the coming months and quarters. They are all designed to really attract trading volume at this point. What we intend to do is embed them in our new trading platform, and so our clients can only see that data when they load an order on our platform and engage our platform for trading. And we believe it’s a very careful curated way of attracting more orders on the platform, but also helping our clients determine how best to trade their orders given the size and given the unique liquidity in the market. So things like tradability will predict the number of responses that you should get back on a given bond. CP Responder will actually predict the likelihood of winning an inquiry based on your unique price and size. And CP Inquiry predicts the best price of an inquiry based on the client type and the size inside of your bond. So these are very unique, very proprietary data products that we’re rolling out. And our latest AI Dealer Direct will actually help you select your dealer counterparty, which is very important when you’re trading larger size orders in our market, so all of these at the outset will be offered exclusively on the platform with lots of restrictions for use. But we do believe over time, we’ll be able to monetize them into pure data feeds for our clients to use in their own proprietary platforms. So, over time, we’re excited about the opportunity. But, right now, the focus of these data products is growing our market share across all our products.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Daniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Chris, first, I just wanted to clarify your comments around July. I think you said market share consistent with July comments, which I think you said were consistent with mid-June. Just curious if that’s different than how the end of June ended up. And then as you think about the current environment, maybe it’d be helpful to think about just given how many macro factors have been impacting both market activity as well as client behavior. What is maybe kind of the ideal backdrop for your products, your platforms and protocols to perform?
Chris Concannon: Sure. So to be accurate, my comment around June levels were running consistent with mid-June levels, obviously, we can’t predict the next eight days. And I will remind you that there is a potential Fed rate hike next week, which as you can imagine can impact volatility quite dramatically. And more and more of volumes are moving into the month end close. We’ve seen that trend building over the last couple of years and certainly it’s reflective of the indexation of the fixed income market, so again, mid-June levels is what I mentioned. And then just a macro market, we’re certainly excited about a potential end to rate hikes, because what we’ve seen over the last quarter is really a lack of investment conviction among our clients. And we heard that directly from our clients as we’ve gone out to talk to all our clients globally. Remember, we had a March banking crisis that left investors with a great deal of caution, particularly around bonds. A sizable portion of the bond market is from the banking sector. So there is quite a great deal of concern around that crisis post the March crisis. And then, now our clients have really turned to watching Fed moves and the continuation of rate hikes. But, as we mentioned earlier, any halt to the Fed rate hikes will leave investors much more attractive towards their potential fixed income investing. So we’re bullish about the market over the coming quarters and years. The other piece of information and we’ve spent the last 6 months going out talking to our clients, as you probably saw in many of their own earnings release releases, they’ve been cutting costs as a result of the revenue challenges that they’ve had as a result of last year. And those cost cuts come in two important pieces: it comes in technology budgets have been cut and headcounts have been cut. So if you can imagine the environment where rate hikes are halted and there’s a surge in investing in fixed income assets, those clients are going to need to outsource their trading solutions and outsource their tech needs to deal with the workflow challenges that they’re going to have, particularly the reduction of their traders that we’ve seen. So we feel exceptionally well positioned around the current market environment, particularly if you see rate hikes halted and the need by all of our clients for technology solutions and better workflow solutions things like our new trading platform offers very seamless workflow solutions as well as our whole automation suite, which by the way continues to grow quarter-over-quarter across high grade, high yield, EM and Eurobonds. So we’re quite excited about the position we’ve put ourselves in, given the potential for the inflows that could come into the fixed income environment.
Richard Schiffman: I’m just going to add to that, Chris. Daniel, it’s also worth looking at the refunding calendar and I don’t have the exact number offhand, but I thought I heard something like next year. It’s over $1 trillion of paper that needs to be refunded and that’s going to create a lot of activity in the market, which is definitely favorable for our platform.
Daniel Fannon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could share your latest thoughts on the regulatory landscape. Is there anything in particular that you guys are watching that could be a helpful tailwind for the business or maybe a little bit of risk on a headwind side that we could see in the coming years? And then specifically, just curious, the latest you’re hearing on the proposal to cut the TRACE reporting time from 15 minutes to 1-minute, what sort of impact that might have? Thank you.
Chris Concannon: Sure. From the regulatory side, obviously we have a global footprint, so we are mindful of regulations across the globe here in the U.S., obviously, we’re still tracking the SEC’s proposals around the treasury market. They’re obviously very favorable towards all-to-all and we continue to hear support for all-to-all and treasuries by regulators. T1 is another proposal that we’re tracking quite closely, obviously the requirement to move settlement to T1 does have an impact on institutional straight through processing and many times that can be favorable to electronic trading more broadly and electronic processing. So T1 is one we look out for, and while it’s a lot of work for everybody, it’s slightly favorable to the electronic solutions over the long-term. The TRACE proposal moving to a 1-minute reporting time, if you look at the market, the majority of the market is near that reporting time today, obviously, manual reports take a little bit longer. But we would expect that to improve, again, similar to T+1 straight through processing and electronic trading more broadly. In Europe, we continue to hear from the regulators around, what is an MTF, the perimeters of an MTF, and what needs to be in an MTF? And it’s certainly having an impact on the regulatory environment, where we see potential new entrants in alternative platforms that try to aggregate trading. It’s very clear in Europe that MTF regulation is becoming more restrictive based on those trading perimeters. We operate in MTFs throughout Europe, so we’re quite comfortable in that environment, where you need to be an MTF to step into our space. But, more broadly, we don’t see any regulatory wins that have material detriment really much more positive to support electronic trading across the globe.
Michael Cyprys: Yeah, great. Thanks so much.
Richard Schiffman: One thing I would just add to that, Michael, if there’s any change in bank capital requirements to the tighter side that’s going to be a tailwind for electronic trading, certainly for all-to-all trading, because that liquidity has to get made up somewhere else and if it becomes harder for the banks to be providing it, it’s going to open the door for a lot more activity in Open Trading.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alexander Blostein: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So, a little bit of a bigger picture question for you guys, and I appreciate all the discussions around some of the new initiatives, but I guess when we look at Slide 11, where you outline progress on Auto-X, CP+, algo trades, et cetera. They’re all up into the right, but the high yield or high grade rather market share has been relatively range bound, as we talked about for the last couple of years. So are they just taking share of the back book? So kind of like the legacy RFQ business and that’s kind of the change in client behavior that you’re observing, but it doesn’t really materialize in higher market share and what in your view will necessarily sort of change that? So as you think about high grade goals over the next couple of years, what could that look like on the back of these initiatives?
Chris Concannon: Sure. First, obviously, we continue to grow share, as I mentioned, across a number of our key products in the face of competition and high grade in particular, we are generally impacted by a lower volatility, particularly around the ETF market, given how important we are to the ETF market makers and some of the systematic hedge funds that trade that ETF arb. So we typically are more impacted than any competitors in that market. With regard to high grade portfolio trading, while we did grow our portfolio trading in high grade somewhere around 13% year-over-year, it’s really not as fast as the market has been growing. So the competitive impact in high grade is largely around the growth of portfolio trading in high grade. We do feel very comfortable about the launch of our enhanced portfolio trading platform and our embedded unique data attributes, and that’s what clients are asking us for. We’ve been out talking to clients that are portfolio traders and, obviously, as Rich mentioned, it’s a very concentrated dealer market in the portfolio space, but it’s certainly also concentrated among the number of traders that trade portfolio trades at the various client desks. I will tell you we are protocol agnostic, while we obviously have different rates for different protocols. We are delivering protocols that our clients are asking for and we’re delivering unique data to help them decide the appropriate protocol at the appropriate time. I do think the other patterns that we have recognized that is lower vol, we do see higher levels of portfolio trading in the market, because it’s just easier to price a portfolio when the market isn’t moving or gyrating. So we’ve also identified that in the second quarter, given the lower volatility.
Richard Schiffman: Maybe it’s about automation, what that is going to do here, one thing we learned in the earliest days of the company that when we make things easier, people trade more. So all of this investment that we’re making in automation and Adaptive Auto-X and all these capabilities, one nice benefit from all this is the potential for increases in turnover and seeing more activity that way. So we believe as this starts to take hold, we’re going to see the benefits come from that more activity taking place, because it’s just easier for people to trade.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. For clients who access your platform via the leading order management systems, to what extent do they have access to your entire suite of protocols, data solutions, workflow solutions, and algorithms?
Chris Concannon: So, yeah, there’s a number of leading sizable order management systems across the globe that we interact with. We certainly work closely with our partners at those order management systems to ensure that our various protocols, our various APIs and our data is available. And we’ve certainly worked closely with some of the largest. The nice thing about our design is when the OMS connects to us; they can move orders into our environment. And then within our environment, clients can move those orders across various different protocols, so they become available instantly in our environment to move them from protocol to protocol. As we mentioned, the new platform that we’ve launched allows clients to load those orders directly from the OMS. And we’re integrated to really all of the OMS that are material in our market. And once they’ve load those orders onto our platform, they can manage them as high-touch, low-touch, and no-touch, which is really delivering them into our automation suite. So it allows a client to really have a centralized cockpit to decide how to trade their various order sizes, and then from that cockpit, they can deliver those orders into each of our protocols. All those protocols are instantly available. But more importantly, we embed that data that I spoke about earlier, that proprietary data side-by-side with their orders, so they can make logical decisions based on data that they’ve never seen before, on what protocol, what dealers, and what automation solutions are available to them. And that’s really had an impact. In fact, as we were rolling out our new platform, we embedded it with a number of what we call power users. And we’ve seen those power users increase their overall activity levels moving from migrating from the old platform to the new platform. To go back to your original question, the integration with the OMS is quite complete, and the new platform is showing early signs of higher levels of activity, given the seamless interactions that clients now have and the number of line items they can manage on a single platform. The other piece of good news with regard to the OMS is our Adaptive Auto-X solution has a number of unique characters in it, when it actually fills a larger size trade, it can fill it in a series of smaller sized trades, as Rich mentioned earlier. Those interactions have all been integrated with all the leading OMS providers. And so, we’re able to access the clients on those platforms can have easy access and seamless access to Adaptive Auto-X. And right now we have within our pilot, a number of clients that are spread out across the various OMS’ that we interact with.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: Thanks for taking the follow-up. Question on retail, I was hoping you could just maybe elaborate on how you’re interfacing with retail demand. I know you guys are more of an institutional shop, but you do have connectivity to wealth platforms, you also get the benefit from the ETF side. So just any color there you can share and how you think about expanding that? How attractive do you view that end market? Thank you.
Chris Concannon: Sure. Great question. And, obviously, we have seen retail re-enter the fixed income market and it’s quite exciting to see fixed income assets as an attractive investment for retail. And you see that in the TRACE numbers as the average trade size and TRACE has dropped dramatically over the last 2 quarters and continues to thrive. We touch retail in a number of different ways, we recently launched our Axess IQ platform, which is designed specifically for private wealth firms, and we’re seeing a great deal of success on that as we continue to onboard new clients on a regular basis each quarter. And it’s hitting record volumes and tapping into a very important part of the retail private wealth sector. The other area that we see retail coming into our market is through the growth of SMA, separately managed accounts. To remind you, these managed accounts are managed by large institutional investors that are using our platform every day. Their tickets come in much smaller size. And so part of the growth of our automation solution that you see quarter-over-quarter is really a reflection of the growth of SMA and the burden of managing small tickets within a large institutional player. Their demand for our automation is growing as the SMA assets are growing. And, certainly, the forecast by industry experts on SMA growth, particularly around the fixed income arena is quite high for the years to come, given where yields are. So we think we’re well positioned for supporting the retail market and quite excited about the potential growth of that SMA part of the industry.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Rich Repetto. Please go ahead.
Chris Concannon: Oh, boy.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, I’m a personal investor. And I’d like to ask, what are your mid-June volumes, because you’re comparing your July volumes to a number that’s fictitious and non-disclosed? So just trying to figure out what your mid-June volumes were?
Chris Concannon: Okay. Rich, are you with Reppeto & Associates now?
Unidentified Analyst: That’s exactly it, yes.
Chris Concannon: All right. Well, we would appreciate if you go back to the golf course, enjoy your retirement. But it’s a fair question, Rich. Look, we are looking at – we can’t predict the next 8 days, so we do want to give some color around the activity levels that we are seeing. And as I mentioned, high grade market share is running at our mid-month June levels, and we’re very excited about next week and month end. So we’re not going to forecast those high grade market share numbers, because July has a lot more involved given the Fed rate decision next week. But thank you for your question and really appreciate your time today away from your very busy schedule.
Unidentified Analyst: Very helpful. Thank you.
Chris Concannon: All right.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call to Chris Concannon.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, and thanks everyone for your time today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks again.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-26 14:25:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on April 26, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Davidson: Thank you, Bo. Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with an update on key business trends; Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter; and then Rick McVey, Founder and Executive Chairman, will provide an update on the market environment and the long-term opportunity ahead for the company. Before I turn the call over to Chris Concannon, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. I would also direct you read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon.
Chris Concannon: Good morning. I'm very pleased to share with you our strong first quarter results on my first earnings call as CEO of MarketAxess. We continue to execute our growth strategy during the quarter and delivered record revenues which increased 9% or 11% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share grew 15%, reflecting the continued improvement in our underlying revenue and earnings growth trends, as shown on Slide 3. These strong results were broad-based across products, protocols and geographies, reflecting the powerful diversification of our model driven by the investments we have made over the past several years. Specifically, we delivered record levels of average daily trading volumes across nearly all products. The fourth consecutive quarter of strong estimated market share gains, record levels of commission revenue across U.S. high yield, emerging markets and eurobonds, record levels of revenue and trading volume contribution from our international businesses and record levels of volume from newer client segments, new initiatives and record levels of automation. In summary, we had a very strong quarter with records across key products and protocols. The impact of the rapid rate rise in 2022 has now filtered into the broader market, resulting in the banking sector market dislocation in March. While we have seen a retracement in industry volumes over the last several weeks, we believe this is a temporary pause as the markets digest the events of March and their impact on the trajectory of rate hikes for the Federal Reserve. Lastly, I could not be more pleased to have Nancy Altobello as our new Lead Independent Director of the Board, which was announced earlier this week. Nancy brings a wealth of audit, talent management, diversity and corporate culture experience to the role, and I'm looking forward to our continued collaboration and partnership. Slide 4 highlights the strength of our unique all-to-all solution, Open Trading. We were very pleased with the performance of Open Trading in March. As liquidity became more challenging in March, we saw daily highs of Open Trading share grow to 57% in high grade and 61% in high yield. For the quarter, we registered record Open Trading average daily volume of $4.5 billion, up 21%, with record U.S. high-grade share of 34%. We are executing approximately 13,000 trades per day in Open Trading and approximately 32,000 trades per day across total credit. Open Trading also delivered total price improvement of $252 million, well in excess of our quarterly revenue. Slide 5 highlights our multi-dimensional growth across new products, new initiatives, new client segments and geographies. First in new products, we grew estimated municipal market share to a record 6.4% in the quarter with 376 active client firms trading. We have also recently integrated the muni broker system with the MarketAxess pool of liquidity to provide clients with more trading options. In U.S. treasuries, we continue to see client growth in our treasury offering with 250 active participants on the platform up from 145 in the prior year. We have established a very strong pipeline of future growth cylinders with record volume across dealer RFQ, portfolio trading, our diversity dealer initiative and Axess IQ, our front end for private banks in Europe. We are also seeing strong contributions to our growth from newer client segments, including hedge funds, systematic funds, dealer initiated flow, and private banks. We generated a record 216 billion in trading volume from these important client segments, which now represent 25% of our total credit trading volume. Our estimated share of U.S. high grade can fluctuate given various market factors including the banking crisis, block trading activity, new issuance, and growth in client segments outside of our focus on institutional client flow. For example, we estimate that the dealer-to-dealer retail segments of TRACE grew 31% year-over-year and now represent a combined 28% of high grade TRACE up from 25% in the prior year. Lastly, in emerging markets, we had record ADV, this quarter with local market volume growing 10% year-over-year to a record $71 billion in the quarter. Slide 6 shows the continued strong adoption of automation tools by our clients, powered by CP+. Automated trading increased to a record $69 billion in volume and a record 398,000 trades. Importantly, our automation tools have continued to grow through periods of significant market dislocation, which is a testament to the quality and accuracy of our CP+ data. Today, Auto-X represents 20% of total credit trade count and 8% of our total credit trading volume. At the core of our automation tools and workflow is CP+, our world-class algorithmic pricing engine, which was a key driver of our record data revenue in the quarter. With the recent launch of Adaptive Auto-X, which is currently in pilot, we are delivering an algo trading solution that automates trading across protocol and liquidity pool while seeking to greatly improve their execution quality. Before I turn the call over to Chris Gerosa, I wanted to provide an update on market trends with three important trading days remaining in the month. Market volumes are weaker in April, but U.S. high grade estimated market share is improved from March and is running above first quarter levels. Now let me turn the call over to Chris for a review of our strong financial results.
Chris Gerosa: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 8, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. For the quarter, we delivered record revenue of $203 million, up 9% driven by strong market share gains across most products. On a constant currency basis, revenues would've increased approximately 11%. Record information services revenue is up 12% or 18%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The benefit of the contract signed in the fourth quarter and increased adoption of CP+, Axess All Prints and TraX data was a positive driver of a strong year-over-year performance. First quarter post-trade revenue included the negative impact of approximately $700,000 on the strengthening U.S. dollar compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the year-over-year growth rate would've been approximately 8%. The lower contribution from RFQ hub was driven by a tax adjustment related to the 2022 financials. The effective tax rate was 25% below the prior year period. On Slide 9, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fees per million. Total commission revenue increased 10%. Our growth in total credit commission revenue was driven by record increases in estimated market share and healthy increases in our trading volume, but was partially offset by lower average fee capture across U.S. high grade. The reduction in high grade fee capture from prior year was driven principally by the lower duration of U.S. high grade bonds traded over our platform compared to the prior year. While U.S. high grade fee capture declined year-over-year, duration has remained relatively stable over the last several months as reflected in the corporate bond duration index. On Slide 10, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. First quarter expenses increased 10% driven principally by investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, expenses would’ve increased 12%. Employee compensation and benefits increased $5 million on a 12% increase in headcount, mainly in technology and customer facing roles to support revenue growth initiatives. Tech and communications expenses increased $3 million due to higher subscription and data hosting expenses. Clearing costs were flat, despite higher Open Trading volumes due to renegotiated clearing fees related to U.S. treasuries and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Our marketing and G&A expenses increased principally due to increases in advertising. G&A costs, higher office related expenses that have been reduced in a prior year due to the pandemic. On Slide 11, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid with cash and investments totaling $440 million, and we had no outstanding debt at quarter end. We are prudently investing our cash to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment to continue to deliver strong net interest income in the coming quarters. We are a strong cash flow generator as our trailing 12-month free cash flow came in at $271 million. During the past 12 months, we paid out $107 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. And our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 based on the financial performance of the company. Now let me turn the call over the Rick to provide an update on market conditions and a long-term growth opportunity ahead of us.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Chris. Slide 13 provides an update on market conditions and U.S. credit. As we have noted over the last several quarters, last year’s rapid rate increases dramatically impacted investment grade index returns, and the higher rate environment is now beginning to flow through to the investment portfolios of banks. The distress trading conditions in some parts of the bank and finance sector in March led to a short-term increase in TRACE volumes with transactions and distressed bank names moving back to the phone, due to the extreme volatility. We believe that the recent softness in corporate bond volumes reported to TRACE is likely to be temporary due to the uncertainty in the banking sector and the upcoming May Fed meeting. The overriding theme in my view is the highest yield environment we have seen in over 13 years and the opportunity for global investors to reallocate assets back into fixed income. That trend was apparent in the record, high grade TRACE volumes in Q1 reflecting higher trading velocity. Market volumes in credit normally fall in April from March due to the holiday calendars. So part of what we are seeing currently is seasonal. Investment grade TRACE ticket count in Q1 grew 59% and average trade sizes declined 25% as fixed income becomes an investible asset class again, and investors reenter the market. Both retail and institutional investors are seeing a higher ticket count leading to an essential need to embrace trading automation for efficiency. Lastly, all these positive market drivers are manifesting themselves in increased velocity of trading. Turnover was an annualized 74% in the first quarter in U.S. high grade up from 64% in the first quarter of 2022. Yields are at their highest level since 2009, and at that time, high grade annual trading turnover was around 80%. Trading velocity is benefiting from higher yields, greater market participation and the technology benefits of improved trading efficiency. Slide 14 illustrates the total revenue opportunity we have before us, which has expanded significantly in the last few years as we have invested to expand our product offering. The product set that we had in 2018 gave us access to a total addressable market of approximately $4 billion in revenue. Since 2018, we have diversified our products and protocols and expanded geographically. For example, we acquired unique capabilities in the U.S. treasury market. We complemented our organic growth and municipal bonds with mini brokers. We have expanded into ETF share trading with our investment in RFQ hub, and we accelerate our growth in post-trade data with the acquisition of regulatory reporting hub. We have also increased our investment in data products, including our comprehensive real time data product CP-plus, and our entry into the index space with both high grade and high yield indices. The investments that we have made over the last several years have expanded our total addressable market by $3 billion to a current estimate of $7 billion. We are in early stages of executing in many of these areas, and we feel more confident than ever in the long runway of growth opportunities still in front of us. In summary, on Slide 15, we continue to execute well across against our growth strategy. We delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth driven by a combination of strong market share gains and improved market volumes. Our global footprint continues to broaden and deepen as we diversify our product offering. We have a strong pipeline of new products and new trading protocols and increase client diversification driven by growth with hedge funds, private banks, and dealer initiated order flow. Now, we would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. McVey. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question this morning from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler.
RichRepetto: Yes. Good morning, Chris and Rick and Chris. First congrats Chris for taking over the helm. I guess the first question is, you come from a long background of automation or other experience in other asset classes and you talked about a lot of metrics here that smaller trade sizes, increased velocity, that point to this electronification. So I guess, one question is this Adaptive Auto-X, what kind of impact do you think is that a key to further along the automation trend or what other – what tools do you see besides Auto-X that are going to really spur that conversion?
Chris Concannon: Well, first thanks for the question and thanks for the congrats. Rich, you’ve probably – you’ve covered me for a long enough number of years that you probably already know my answer to the question. I’m quite bullish about electronification of the bond market. I’ll start by mentioning we did have record volume and record revenue in our automation suite. But the first key ingredient to automation is data. Data is a key ingredient. If you have good data, you’re going to have good automation. Second, if automation replicates what manual traders do identically or a similar replication, then you’ll have constant growth in automation, meaning people will adopt it to gain efficiencies. The key ingredient to what I’d call accelerated growth of automation is if it achieves better results than the human execution and does it efficiently. And that’s really what we’re targeting Adaptive Auto-X to do, which is achieve better results by automating the execution, solution across protocols, across liquidity pools and giving it unique data. Our automation, it’s important to point out our automation suite, which Adaptive Auto-X is just in pilot now and just launched just a couple weeks ago. But our overall automation suite grew 40% year-over-year which is quite healthy growth to hit those records. And more recently we saw in – we launched Auto-X in municipal, and we saw that grow quickly to 23% of total exempt trades, which is pretty impressive growth. So my point is, Rich, that automation when it’s starts to be adopted, it can have pretty healthy growth rates, even in the more challenging market that we saw in the first quarter. The automation tools held up throughout the difficulties of March. With all that said and all that growth and all those records when you really add up our total automation footprint in the U.S. corporate bond market, it’s just under 2% of the market. So we have a really long way to go when it comes to automation. To put that in comparison, the FX market has seen algos – client algos now achieve over 20% of the market. So while we’ve still seen record volume and record growth in our automation suite. We’re at the early stages of automating the full bond market.
RichRepetto: Got it. Got it. And Chris, I think you guys addressed some of this, but we are seeing volumes now lighten up from mid-March and you talked about seasonality of April and sort of reallocation I think is still going on. But can you just make investors a little bit, has the outlook for 2023, I thought super strong. Is that still a case or is this just a momentary pause or has anything changed the outlook for volumes – credit volumes for the year I would say?
Chris Concannon: So great question. I mean, we couldn’t be any more bullish about the bond market, despite the – what I’ll call momentary or temporary disruption in the market. Rich, bonds are cool again. We’re seeing a higher interest from our clients as well as their clients in terms of allocation of investment dollars towards fixed income market. It’s certainly a market that is providing better yield and better principal protection than the stock market. I would say we are in a risk off environment coming off the heels of a – the market disruption in the banking sector. But we also are seeing a unique April month of holidays. I will tell you my friends in the equities, the FX, the derivatives, and even the crypto market, they’re all complaining about volumes. So it’s not unique to the fixed income market. It’s really market wide that we’re seeing this risk off environment. We do have the Fed next week, so I do think a lot of investors are sitting on the fine line waiting to see some of the Fed moves, and we are going through earning season as well. This week we are seeing higher levels of activity. So it’s encouraging now that all the vacation and spring breaks are over, we’re seeing higher levels of activity. More importantly, we do see and expect higher new issue market in May. So we’re hearing more positive things around the new issue market in May.
RichRepetto: Got it. Got it. Lastly, most of the top level managers and fixed income trading platforms are skilled golfers. So I guess my question, Chris, what have you done to improve your golf skills?
Chris Concannon: So that’s a very appropriate question Rich. I would say my golf score is correlated to our revenue and market share. As it – as our revenue and market share goes up, my golf score, my handicap will continue to rise.
RichRepetto: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next now to Chris Allen of Citi.
Chris Allen: Yes. Good morning, guys. I won’t comment on your golf game. I know, how challenge it is. Just on the CP-plus uptake showing up in the market data. Is that just a longer-term ongoing trend or is that maybe an anticipation of Adaptive Auto-X launch? And then maybe you could just give us some color just on what the feedback has been on the pilot phase there and kind of expectations around when that’ll be formally launched to the broader marketplace?
Chris Concannon: Sure. And your first question on market data or just CP-plus generally.
Chris Allen: Just how that’s kind of flowing through into market data, like what’s driving that?
Chris Concannon: Yes. So obviously the growth in market data, and as we mentioned, we saw record revenues in our market data in Q1, largely driven by the growth of CP-plus across U.S. high grade, high yield EM and Eurobonds. It’s certainly becoming the benchmark of real-time pricing in the U.S. corporate bond market and where – that’s where we’re seeing the demand for CP-plus. So we’re excited about that. That CP-plus is a key driver of our automation success. Again, record revenue and record volumes in our automation suite driven by the superiority of CP-plus. It’s a key ingredient as well to our Adaptive Auto-X, which allows clients to take advantage of across all of our different protocols and also take advantage of providing liquidity based on CP-plus pricing. So it’s certainly a sign that our largest institutional clients are comfortable with the price point of CP-plus and what it produces in terms of price of U.S. bonds. Adaptive Auto-X’s early days, I will tell you the excitement as we went out to talk to our largest clients across the U.S. and Europe, they’re all extremely excited about access to Adaptive Auto-X. We had to actually reduced the pilot because of overwhelming demand to get into the pilot, but it’s early days and something that we’re super excited about.
Chris Allen: Thanks, guys. I’ll get back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Kyle Voigt of KBW.
Kyle Voigt: Hey, good morning. I like the addition of that chart on flat five that shows the volume growth from some of these newer user segments. I guess the one that I wanted to hone in on that’s all record volume in the quarter was this hedge fund clients and growth there. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more color as to how that’s ramped over the last couple years and where you’re seeing a lot of the growth from – is that from systematic funds or is it from credit hedge funds? And also if you could comment on whether you’re continuing to see growth in the number of those hedge fund clients being onboarded on to the platform as we can – try to think about whether this growth from this segment has momentum and is sustainable as we look ahead?
Chris Concannon: Yes, no, it’s an exciting area, Kyle, that we’ve spent a lot of time on. We have a team dedicated to our hedge fund segment and particularly focused on the systematic fund complex. That’s an area that’s exciting to me because I’ve known these clients from my equity and FX days and they’re all ramping up and gearing up to take advantage of the current fixed income market structure. All to all is a key ingredient to them. They are both – they both cross the spread, but more importantly, they are providers of liquidity and see that as a huge opportunity to launch some of their trading strategies in the fixed income market. In an environment where you only cross spread, it's very difficult for systematic hedge funds to engage their strategies in that market. And our all-to-all platform provides them with the ability to both provide liquidity as well as cross spread at a much more reasonable cost. And that's the key part of their trading strategy. I would say there's a healthy pipeline of new entry from the systematic fund group. I think we're still early days. We've seen some fund groups have substantial success in the U.S. credit market across both high-yield and high-grade, and they're certainly expanding that success into other product areas. But I'd say it's a healthy pipeline, and we're still a long way off from a more mature entry of that segment.
Kyle Voigt: That's really helpful. And if I can ask just a follow-up on the muni business. Just wondering if you could talk about the transition of the MuniBrokers business and what that means for revenues and revenue captures – revenue captures rates as we go through that transition. And then maybe you provide some updated thoughts on kind of the long-term potential revenue capture that you see for that muni bond business. I think it was just under maybe $200 per million in the quarter. But I recall that when you launched into the muni space, I think the opportunity at that time felt like the fee capture rates could be closer to $400 or $500 per million. So just wondering maybe if we can get an updated kind of view in terms of long-term, what the fee capture opportunity is and then maybe what the market share opportunity is as you see it today, too.
Chris Concannon: Sure. First, on overall muni, the muni business is thriving. We did hit a record market share in the muni market, so again another record for the quarter. We're super excited about the integration of MuniBrokers. Our vision of the MuniBrokers acquisition was, one, collection and acquisition of data to help us build our data products across all our products; but also it was the acquisition of more liquidity and more transaction volume, so not only the MuniBrokers business, but also integrating a large quantity of that business into our MarketAxess pool of liquidity. We've started that final step of integration and are very excited about the outcome so far, but it's not a big bang integration. It's a multistep integration over the course of the next quarter. With regard to capture, I'll let Chris jump in and answer the capture question.
Chris Gerosa: Hi, Kyle. And just a reminder, the MuniBroker fee model was a subscription-based model. And it ranged anywhere from $60 to $80 per million. And our plan is to convert that volume into Open Trading, where we'll capture our Open Trading team model. And minding everyone, this is a tax-exempt muni product, which typically ranges between $150 to $200 per million. So we're looking to capture that either fee card as we transition that volume into our platform.
Kyle Voigt: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to jump in a little bit on the high-yield business. Chris, I think, you gave an update on high-grade market share. So I was wondering if you could comment on high yields as well in April. And bigger picture, we've seen just more volatility in the market share within high yield over the last, call it, 6 to 9 months. Maybe you could just kind of comment what is the bigger driver of market share shifts we've seen month-to-month, and sort of what do you think about is the ideal environment for high-yield share to sort of accelerate on a more consistent basis?
Chris Concannon: Sure. First of all, we obviously saw a record volume and record revenue in our high-yield market in the first quarter. So again, a number of records in the first quarter. As we look at April, obviously, volumes – and TRACE volumes are down substantially across both high grade and high yield. So it's a more challenging market. And then – but overall, the high-yield market, I'm super excited about. We continue to make headway in the high-yield market. Our OT penetration is a key ingredient in high yield. We saw 51% of our high-yield volume be through Open Trading liquidity, which obviously is where we're gaining a great deal of market share. But overall, we see high-yield participants enjoying that alternative liquidity, particularly when the market continues to get stressed. So when there's volatility in the high-yield market, Open Trading does spike, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. So to the extent there's additional volatility, to the extent we see high-grade bonds dropping into the high-yield market, we'll continue to see that volatility throughout the course of the year. And that volatility does -- has historically led to higher market share for our Open Trading.
Alex Blostein: Okay. Got you. And I guess the dynamic in March with the decline in high-yield market share was almost too much volatility. Is that kind of how you describe it?
Chris Concannon: Well, there was clear volatility in March throughout and more importantly there's a number of distressed bonds that we don't trade in Open Trading during those times. But yes, we saw substantial volatility in March, which also led to some of those spike market shares in our Open Trading solution.
Alex Blostein: Okay. Thanks. And then just maybe my follow-up. I was hoping you guys could hone in a little bit more on the retail trading opportunity you see. Maybe frame what kind of the retail trading contribution is in credit today across the platform and maybe help delineate what the fee per million difference is there and how that could ultimately drive an improvement in the blended fee per million over time. Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Yes. Well, first, our primary business is the institutional credit business, the institutional fixed income business. That's our distribution channel and has been historically. We have seen a recent rise in retail in the market, an area that we haven't dedicated full resources to. We do see an opportunity in retail, and we've made headway with Axess IQ, our private bank offering in Europe. We're seeing higher demand for that offering. We've launched it to a client in Asia as well. So we do see an opportunity in retail, particularly given where our execution quality sits in terms of the institutional market. If you look at the muni market, even high grade and high yield, the overall market trade size is declining from a historic level. So we're seeing smaller trade sizes across our platform and across the TRACE market. So we do think we have a very viable retail offering given the quality price that we can deliver with an Open Trading trade execution, just higher quality price and being able to deliver at much smaller sizes than historically. So we think there is a wonderful retail opportunity as retail reinvest in the fixed income market given the yields that this market is showing.
Alex Blostein: Awesome, thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Maybe if you could just zone in a little bit on just volatility in general, thinking about obviously some of the more extreme trading in March, if we do have that type of environment off and on this year. How do you view in terms of the market share dynamic – or I should say, really more like the behavior of trading across desks? Do you tend to see more usage of the phone? Or is that more in distressed bonds like you alluded to, Chris? And what – can you talk about the education process, I guess, and the merits of the Open Trading platform and the price improvement that you can get in those types of environments? And if – is that sort of an uphill battle to try to sort of gain share? Or do you think it's really achievable?
Chris Concannon: So first, we thrive in volatile markets. We do – if you look back at 2020, there was obviously records set across 2020. So our platform, our offering does thrive in volatile markets. More importantly, and March was evidence of this, our automation tools ran consistently throughout the disruption and volatility in March so – which is a key differentiator from prior volatile times like 2020. So we feel really good about the offering. We feel exceptionally good about the liquidity that is provided through our all-to-all during more volatile times. As I mentioned, our OT markets or Open Trading all-to-all market share did spike upwards during the most volatile times of March, reflecting alternative liquidity providers stepping into the market when traditional providers are stepping back from that market. So we feel good if there's volatility in the market. We feel really good about our position in the market. And – but particularly around the distressed bonds, that's a market where – and again, they're not frequent, but that's a market that does tend to go to the phone or go to chat when there is a distressed bond situation. But again, we do enjoy the benefits of volatility. So if volatility comes back into the market, we would expect an offering that is quite comfortable for our clients.
Brian Bedell: Okay, great. And then a follow-up, just going back to the slide where you showed the market – where you showed the growth in the new segments or actually not new segments, but growth in particularly hedge funds and systematic strategies. Can you talk about your market share in those areas versus your overall market share? In other words, I guess, if you continue to penetrate those markets, should we expect that to be a positive contributor to your market share going forward?
Chris Concannon: Well, first of all, the new entry, particularly the systematic fund complex, I think it actually has a benefit to our market share, but overall turnover in the market. These are new strategies that are being launched into the fixed income market that we haven't seen before. So it's really new turnover and attractive to both us and our clients, our bank clients and our liquidity providers to interact with that kind of liquidity. So the new entry is a positive for not only the liquidity and the bond market, but also overall turnover and velocity of trading in the bond market. Obviously, the new entry takes full advantage of all-to-all, so we're obviously favored given our all-to-all offering across all of our products from high-grade to high-yield to munis, and even our treasury product is another place where we're seeing entry. So super positive for the market, super positive for velocity and turnover in the fixed income market, but particularly positive for MarketAxess and our all-to-all offerings across all the products.
Brian Bedell: Great, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Daniel Fannon of Jefferies.
Daniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up, Chris, on some of your comments and your prepared remarks around the factors that impact your market share. And obviously, new issuance has always been something you've talked about, but I think there was also discussion around products or growth in areas that you don't – or parts of the market that you don't participate in. So maybe if you could expand upon what your true addressable market is within kind of high grade as we can think about what the factors or what your market share should look like based upon what you are currently in and maybe what you plan to enter in, in terms of additional markets going forward.
Chris Concannon: Sure. First, I want to point out that we had first quarter record revenues and record volumes across most of our products. We certainly – and we also had a sizable growth in share in our U.S. corporate products as well, high yield grew over three percentage points in market share. And we had records in open trading ADV across U.S. corporate bonds as well. So overall growth and records across our U.S. corporate products is quite exciting, when we look at, if we want to get granular and look at a market share of high grade, we saw across TRACE higher levels of retail. That's a client segment that we have not chased after or spent resources on, retail clients do have connectivity to us, but the overall retail market did grow in investment grade bonds over the course of the first quarter. And that's explains some of the lower average trade size in the TRACE market as well. But quite frankly, we're quite happy with record revenues and record volumes across our U.S. corporate market and quite happy with our market share growth across the U.S. corporate market.
Daniel Fannon: Understood. Okay. I guess then just a separate question, following up on the distribution fees or higher, you said there was some dealer I think new dealers as well as upgrades from existing fee plans. So maybe as we think about that good run rate from here, is the upgrade cycle something that we should think about as ongoing? Any more color that would be helpful?
Chris Concannon: Yes, Dan, it was really a combination year-over-year and sequentially both upgrades and new dealers signing on for fixed fee plans. But as you point out, it's difficult to anticipate what that number or how it could change going forward. From a modeling perspective, we would recommend, and we're looking at it as Q1 being the run rate, but also recognizing that there is risk to our fixed distribution fees to the extent there's consolidation in the dealer sector, we could see fees dissipate or alternatively we could see new dealers come on board to offset that.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Simon Clinch of Atlantic Equities.
Simon Clinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I recall that I think it was last quarter you mentioned that you were looking at ways to, I guess, share in more of the value creation of open trading with your clients. And I was wondering if you could just update us on your thoughts around that, how you'd expect to, I guess, implement such a strategy over time and how meaningful that could be?
Chris Concannon: Sure. First of all, open trading continues to set records. So we had a record revenue in open trading and we obviously see saw record spikes of open trading market share of our overall market. And it also continues to deliver substantial cost savings to our clients. And as I mentioned in my open remarks, cost savings that are actually higher than our total revenue, so very attractive to our client base. The other attractive piece that open trading delivers is the ability for clients to avoid crossing spread and reduce – and improve their overall execution quality. And that's an area of focus of ours as we encourage clients, more clients to use all open trading to provide other clients with liquidity. It's a key ingredient to our treasury offering as well, where we're offering open trading or all to all in the treasury market for the first time and seeing a number of very large clients taking advantage of that offering. So exciting activities in our open trading offering in treasuries but also across open trading – across all our products, it continues to be a driver of market share in munis, in our emerging markets in high yield and high grade. So super exciting activity in the quarter on our all to all open trading offering. And we're continuing to see clients and client behavior change to take advantage of that.
Simon Clinch: Okay, thanks. And then just secondarily in terms, when we think about the comments about market share so far in April for U.S. high grade being you're back above Q1 levels. I was wondering if you could perhaps put it in terms of the market share. If you adjust out the sort of distress bonds that sort of distorted everything, has the market share been pretty stable after you adjust for that in March through to April? Or has there been a pickup even relative to that sort of adjusted level?
Chris Gerosa: So there's – I appreciate the question. There's three important days left in the month. Obviously, it's month end. So we certainly enjoy higher levels of activity around month end and we'll be putting out our monthly volumes and market share next week. So it's just a little bit too early to predict where our market share levels are going to end up. But as I mentioned in the open remarks, we are seeing market share in high grade above Q1.
Simon Clinch: All right. Thank you.
Chris Gerosa: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thank you for taking the question. Maybe just continue with the theme just on April, maybe you could just comment a little bit of what you're seeing around pricing trends on the fee per million side so far in April. How's that sort of stack up versus the first quarter? And then if maybe you could elaborate on some of the moving pieces around the IG versus high yield fee capture in the first quarter?
Chris Concannon: Yes, I'll take this one. I made comments in my prepared remarks that with respect to the high grade fee capture, we've seen stability and it's very indicative of the Bloomberg Duration index that's out there for everybody to monitor. And there's a lot of factors that contribute to our fee capture. You have the product mix, you have the protocol mix across our Q1 open trading, and so it really depends month to month on what mix of product is coming through. And I'll point to where we saw upside in historical quarters was we saw a heavier mix of high yield, which is our highest fee product in the product set. And in this month we're seeing elevated volumes with Eurobonds relative to the market volumes that we're seeing sequentially, which is one of the lower fee capture products. So really goes down to what's the product mix because we're not seeing the same impact that we saw with the high grade duration compressing our fee capture year-over-year.
Michael Cyprys: Okay, great. And then just a follow up question, as you guys have more and more success with open trading that does, I believe, tie up more working capital for clearing of those trades, because you're self clear. So maybe you can just remind us how much of the balance sheet resources are being used to support the clearing of customer trades, and if open trading volumes were to say double, how should we think about that translating into incremental balance sheet resources being used to help support that? And then how do you think about driving more balance sheet efficiency for that over time?
Chris Concannon: Yes, so in a peak of March, we had enough capital residing within our two clearing broker dealers to support the elevated trading volumes that we were seeing in light of it contributing to increased fails and increased deposit requirements. So of the $330 million of cash that you saw at the end of March, roughly $200 million of that was residing within the two clearing entities to support open trading. So as we think about our balance sheet today, we feel very comfortable with the amount of capital residing in the company to support our business and not seen on the balance sheet. We didn't have any outstanding debt at quarter end, but we do have access to $750 million of borrowing facilities, a secured facility at the holding company and $250 million unsecured facility at the holding company and $250 million of secured to broker dealers, which we have not had to borrow on late, but we do have the ability to secure additional funds if we need to.
Chris Gerosa: I would just point out a growth in open trading and particularly a doubling of open trading will produce additional cash to our balance sheet pretty dramatically given our current corporate margins. So that's a healthy problem to have as you grow open trading to produce more cash into the balance sheet. So again, Chris mentioned spikes in open trading. We have plenty of capital to support open trading spikes and open trading growth as it stands today.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We go next now to Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. Can you provide an update on the current competitive dynamics in the recently issued component of the corporate bond market and how much a total market volume does that segment represent?
Chris Concannon: So the competitive dynamic of corporate bond market?
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: The recently issued component,
Chris Concannon: So Patrick, I'll jump in here, but as you know, following us for a long time, those numbers ebb and flow with the calendar. So the newly issued bonds and peak periods can get up to 12% 13% of TRACE in the short-term. And they average something lower than that, probably more like 7%. So it ebbs and flows with the calendar, but quite honestly, I don't think the dynamic has changed in terms of the competitive landscape around new issues.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. Thank you. And then can you provide an update on what you're seeing in terms of client interest in your portfolio trading solution?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Our portfolio trading solution had record volume in Q1. It's grown substantially year-over-year. We have obviously been delivering numerous features and functionality to clients throughout the course of 2022 and even today we're constantly delivering functionality. So the reception is in the numbers given the records that we've seen in portfolio trading. I do think portfolio trading particularly in March and part of the first quarter is a little bit challenged to provide portfolio trading during more volatile times. But portfolio trading is an important part of the market and we'll continue to be here as a workflow solution for clients and we continue to deliver high value tool for clients to manage their portfolio. I think the next step in portfolio trading is really building the analytics to decide what to portfolio and what not to put in your portfolio trading. Which is really what we're hearing from our clients in terms of demand, they want to understand analytics around the portfolio to adjust their portfolio, either pull bonds out or put bonds in to improve the pricing of a portfolio. But certainly very pleased with our performance in the portfolio trading landscape.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And it appears we have no further questions this morning. I would like to turn the conference back to the company.
Chris Concannon: Thank you all for your time today and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the MarketAxess first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Would like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great day. Goodbye.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on January 25th, 2023. I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company. Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review key business trends and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2021. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year results. We continued to execute our growth strategy and delivered the third consecutive quarter of record market share gains across nearly all our product areas. Strong increases in trading volumes and significant price improvement for clients through our unique all-to-all trading protocol, Open Trading. Our underlying revenue growth trends improved materially in the quarter despite near-term bond duration and FX revenue headwinds. We delivered 8% revenue growth, 10% adjusted for currency, EBITDA growth of 10% and EPS growth of 15%. With this strong finish to the year, we delivered our 14 straight year of record annual revenue. Slide four highlights the key areas of our growth strategy. Our leadership position in global credit continues to expand beyond just U.S. high-grade with record estimated market share in high-yield in municipals, record share in Eurobonds and accelerating share gains of almost 300 basis points in emerging markets, reflecting our increasing global diversification. The deep pool of liquidity on our platform continues to expand with a record of nearly 2,100 active client firms and a record number of active traders. We have seen especially strong growth in our international business with over 1000 active client firms and nearly 6,000 active traders. As traditional sources of liquidity have become scarce, the importance of our all-to-all liquidity increases and a record 38% of our credit volume was executed through Open Trading. This has been a key driver of our estimated market share gains and a source of valuable price improvement for our clients. For the full year 2022, an astonishing 1,300 client firms provided liquidity on the MarketAxess platform. In summary, the foundation of our business has never been better with accelerating growth in trading volume, new market share records, increasing momentum in new product areas, and a substantial addressable market opportunity. With this strong financial performance as backdrop, earlier this month we announced that Chris Concannon, a proven leader, deeply experienced in electronic markets will assume the CEO role in April and I will take on the new role of Executive Chairman. I would like to congratulate Chris on the promotion as CEO. It is well deserved and given his strengths in automation, e-trading protocols, data product delivery, and ETFs, Chris is the right person to lead the company. And now is the right time to make this transition because we have never been in a better position. I am excited about my new role as Executive Chairman where I will continue to work with Chris and our Board of Directors on long-term strategy, key client relationships, regulatory affairs and investor communications. We will continue to invest actively in our business by developing new trading and data capabilities, adding new product areas and expanding internationally. We believe we have an outstanding opportunity set for the next decade and beyond, and many reasons to believe the fixed income market environment will be favorable for e-trading and data revenue growth. Slide five provides an update on market conditions and U.S. credit. In 2022, the Fed raised the Fed funds rate a total of 425 basis points, making it the fastest rate hike cycle since 1980 to 1981. This shock to the fixed income markets, especially with the initial moves in the first half of the year, drove an unprecedented 14% decline in investment grade indices for the year, the largest negative return I have seen in my career. Along with these price declines duration declined approximately 20% from year end 2021 levels to the lows in October, directly impacting high-grade fee capture for institutional client e-trading activity.

TRACE:
TRACE: Slide six shows the strong multi-year gains in estimated market share from the pre-pandemic period in 2019. This is the third consecutive quarter of top quartile market share gains for the company. In Q4 2022, all but one of our primary products were in the top quartile of historical data for year-over-year quarterly growth versus the past 10 years. Strong market share gains across our global product set combined with improving market volume and bond duration trends positioned the company well for revenue growth in 2023. Now let me turn the call over to Chris for more details on business trends.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick, and thank you for the kind remarks. The last several years have been an incredible experience leveraging your deep fixed income market knowledge and working with you as a trusted partner and executive. The track record that you have established is unparalleled and I am deeply grateful to you and the Board for having their confidence to pass the CEO reins to me for the next phase of the growth trajectory for MarketAxess. This is truly an honor, so thank you for all your support and I'm looking forward to working with our clients, with you and with the Board on our many strategic initiatives that we will continue to unlock shareholder value for years to come. The team that we have assembled here is world-class and we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. Slide eight illustrates some of those tremendous growth opportunities. As we begin 2020, the strength of our franchise in terms of product and geographic breadth has never been stronger. Our leadership in global credit is expanding reflected in the strong market share gains that we achieved over the last several quarters. These gains only serve to reinforce the sizable revenue opportunity that we have ahead of us. We believe the product opportunities that we have are further enhanced by the current market conditions. Higher yields typically lead to higher velocity of trading, which will increase the demand for electronic trading solutions. January month-to-date has seen strong new issue activity, which reduces market share in the short-term, but increases outstanding debt. Our total credit ADV month-to-date is showing solid double digit growth year-over-year and sequentially. Slide nine provides an update on Open Trading. The diversity of our liquidity pool has made a significant difference in the quality of execution for our clients. We delivered price improvement of $945 million in Open Trading for the full year well in excess of our annual revenue of $718 million. We believe that the price improvement opportunity we deliver to clients provides us with additional flexibility to fine tune our pricing over time particularly when we are delivering such high levels of execution quality to the client transactions. Open Trading is able to deliver these levels of price improvement because it increases market participation by bringing a multitude of investment banks, systematic and alternative funds, ETF market makers and institutional investor clients into one unique pool of liquidity. This unique liquidity pool is good for market participants and more recently regulators have become more focused on these types of protocols that support liquidity and market resiliency. This is a particular focus in the rate space where we believe our all-to-all solution in U.S. treasuries is very well positioned with a record 244 active client firms now on the treasury platform up from 192 in the prior year. Slide 10 highlights the increasing momentum we are seeing with automation and credit trading. Automation tools are critical to solving for the pain points facing our clients. Clients are facing increasing cost constraints and need to find more efficient workflow solutions. Our automation suite of tools will be critical to helping our clients solve for these cost pressures while delivering high quality execution. Automated trading increased to a record $62 billion in volume and a record 383,000 no-touch trades reflecting continued strong adoption. Today, Auto-X represents 20% of total trade count and 8% of our credit trading volume. We also saw increased adoption of our Auto-X Responder solution during the fourth quarter. Additionally, the use of dealer algorithms continues to grow across our platform. Clients are increasingly facing higher ticket counts and smaller trade sizes while trying to manage their technology costs. Our automation tools are increasingly in demand to help address these growing challenges. Lastly, in the first half of this year, we will have an initial launch of our Adaptive Auto-X solution, which will provide algorithmic workflows for clients to systematically access broader liquidity across multiple trading protocols. This new service is expected to unlock additional cost savings for clients while simplifying client workflow. Slide 11 illustrates the growth we are continuing to drive in portfolio trading. The fourth quarter was another record for portfolio trading with total volume of $31 billion up 135% year-over-year. Estimated high-grade and high-yield portfolio trading market volumes have remained relatively flat at around 5% to 6% of secondary TRACE volume over the last several quarters. We believe approximately 65% to 70% of our portfolio trading activity is currently using electronic trading venues. And based on that, we estimate that we had an estimated 31% share of the electronic portfolio trading market up from 17% in the prior year. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Gerosa to provide an update on our financials.
Christopher Gerosa: Thank you, Chris. On slide 13, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $178 million up 8%, which was our best fourth quarter ever driven by record market share gains across most products. Excluding the impact of FX, revenue would have increased approximately 10%. These strong results include the negative impact of a 9% decline in total credit fee capture, driven principally by the lower duration of U.S. high-grade bonds traded over the platform. Record information services revenue was up 9% or 17% excluding the impact of FX. The full year effect of the contract signed in the fourth quarter is a positive driver as we move into 2023. Fourth quarter post-trade revenue included the negative impact of approximately $1.1 million on the strengthening U.S. dollar compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of FX, the year-over-year growth rate would have been approximately 8%. The increase in [Technical Difficulty] was principally due to a higher interest income of $3.2 million driven by higher rates. The effective tax rate was 25.4%, slightly below the prior year period, which included the negative impact of return to provision adjustments. On slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and fee capture. Total commission revenue increased 9%. Our growth in total credit commission revenue was driven by record increases in estimated market share and healthy increases in our trading volume, but was partially offset by lower fee capture across U.S. high-grade. The lower high-grade fee capture was driven principally by higher bond yields and slightly lower years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. All else equal and assuming the same level of trading volume, we estimate that the change in U.S. high-grade duration lowered our fourth quarter commission revenue by approximately $10 million. While the U.S. high-grade fee capture declined year-over-year and was down slightly from 3Q 2022 levels, duration did move higher intra-quarter as reflected in the Corporate Bond Index duration, which is well below those set in October 2022. On slide 15, we provide you with our expense detail. Fourth quarter expenses increased 8%, driven principally by invest investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Excluding the impact of FX, expenses would have increased 12%. Employee compensation and benefits increased $3 million on an increase in headcount, mainly in technology and customer facing roles to support revenue growth initiatives. The increase in clearing fees was due to the strong increase in credit open trading volume. On slide 16, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of December 31st, our cash and investments were $515 million and we had no outstanding debt. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow came in at $261 million. During the year, we paid out $106 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and for 2022 we repurchased 280,000 shares for a total of $88 million, $100 million remains on the outstanding repurchase authorization. Our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.72, which was based on the financial performance of the company. On slide 17, we have our 2023 guidance for expenses, the effective tax rate, and CapEx. We expect that total 2023 expenses will be in a range of $418 million to $446 million. Approximately 65% of the increase is due to our continued investments in trading system and personnel to support our product and geographical expansion. We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2023 will be in the range of 25% to 26% and 2023 CapEx is expected to range from $52 million to $58 million of which the majority relates to capitalized software development costs, resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements. Our full year expense and CapEx guidance is based on foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31st, 2022. Now let me turn the call back to Rick.
Richard McVey: Thank you, Chris. In summary, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We delivered record levels of market share and enhanced our competitive position in the institutional client e-trading space, both in the U.S. and on the international front. Our global footprint continues to broaden and deepen as we diversify our product offering and achieve record growth in active clients. The market is increasingly turning to our unique Open Trading solution for liquidity and significant price improvement. Market volumes have improved and we are currently seeing positive trends in fee capture and FX. And lastly the improved macro backdrop for fixed income markets is creating a very attractive operating environment for MarketAxess in 2023. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Richard Repetto: Yes. Good morning Rick and Chris and Chris. First Rick, congratulations on the transition to the Chairman role. It's very well deserved and we thank you very much for mentoring that proven leader in the new asset class, Mr. Concannon.
Richard McVey: Thanks, Rich.
Chris Concannon: Yes, I needed some extra mentoring Rich.
Richard Repetto: But no, true, you stuck with it and congrats Rick. So you're very bullish on the outlook for volumes. You know U.S. high-grade I think is already standing at a record level in January and appears that the stars are lining up. I guess my question, Rick, is there anything that we should be, like, how can this get derailed the outlook on volumes? Because we've seen it happen in commodity volumes when you -- people expected energy, oil, but financial products generally have performed as expected I guess, but is there anything that you're watching that could potentially be unexpected and impact volumes?
Richard McVey: Not currently. But of course it's a full year ahead and markets are full of surprises. I will say it's encouraging to see that the mutual fund outflows that took place most of 2022 have started to turn into inflows, which is opening up the new issue calendar for the high-grade market as we start the year. And who knows that the expectation right now is that we could have a soft landing and the inflation numbers will continue to come down, but nothing is certain and there is the possibility that we get a negative surprise on inflation and the Fed has to continue to move rates higher in the near-term, but that's not the expectation right now. And I will say, while the high-grade market is wide open, we are still not seeing anywhere near normal levels of activity in markets like high-yield and emerging markets in even euros. So it's a good sign that high-grade is leading the way and we're having robust levels of new issue activity this month. But what I would expect to happen is this improving environment will work its way into the high-yield in emerging markets as well. And EM in particular volumes were greatly depressed in 2022 with some of the market challenges and FX challenges throughout the course of last year. So there's a huge opportunity there that is the market environment does continue to improve and we have China reopening that EM market volumes may follow the path of high-grade and improved. They have not done that yet, but that would be something to watch, I think, in the quarters ahead.
Richard Repetto: Got it. Got it. And I was just looking at the, this is for Chris Gerosa, the cash, excuse me, the cash levels seem like they went up substantially like over $150 million quarter-to-quarter cash and cash equivalents. Any explanation or color behind that?
Christopher Gerosa: Yes, Rich, it's a seasonality effect with our clearing operations. We have to put capital into DTC to support our failed activity. So at the end of September, you have elevated fails, which takes on some of the cash and the seasonality impact as you get into December, there's less trading volume lower fails, which reduces in more cash on the balance sheet that we don't have to hold at DTC.
Richard Repetto: Got it. Got it. And, one last thing, Rick, the seasonality here usually, and you mentioned the higher new issuance, so just so I guess we can, I don't know what is braced, but people won't be, I guess is it fair to expect that the market share numbers in January are likely to come down? They seasonally seem like they do that all the time because low issue -- our issuance is low in December, then higher in January, so that they had to assume that market share is likely to come down, do that, that seasonal effect?
Richard McVey: That is the norm. That is, you're exactly right, Rich. That is the normal month-to-month seasonal pattern because new issue is at the lowest level in December and often the highest in January. But we're taking a holistic view of our credit market opportunity and the guidance that Chris gave in credit ADV month-to-date in January puts us at or around record credit ADV levels. So we see robust trading activity when we look more broadly across all products that we're involved in credit.
Richard Repetto: Got it. Thanks guys and looking forward to the transition.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Allen with Citi. Your line is open.
Christopher Allen: I wanted to followup a little bit on the high-grade side. One of the -- basically the one pushback we're getting on the stock now is just that the market share of high-grade has been pretty static if you kind of look at it over the last three years, right around 20%, 22%. I was wondering if you could provide any color there, particularly in the context of recent quarters you see in the average trade size coming down, which should be helpful for your market share of high-grade. I'm just wondering if there's any dealer activity in terms of balancing share on high-grade versus high-yield where you're seeing good gains there, or there's some other factors apply?
Christopher Gerosa: Yes, Chris, I'm happy to take that one. And I think the way to think about high-grade is, we are seeing record levels of activity even in the fourth quarter in our Open Trading all-to-all solution. So we are seeing gains in terms of Open Trading hit 33% of our total volume in Q4, so we are seeing gains there. We are also seeing gains in our portfolio trading solution in high-grade. We had record volume in PT in high-grade of $17 billion up close to over 90%. So we're making gains. Obviously direct dealer RFQ has been running flat for us. We also made gains in our dealer RFQ, sorry, was up 23%. But when I look at high-grade and high-yield full U.S. corporate credit, the overall activity from our clients is still positive and you're obviously seeing those big gains in high-yield. But again the high-yield gains are driven by our Open Trading volume which ADV grew by 43% in the Q4. So, overall credit activity on the platform is showing signs of substantial growth, particularly driven by Open Trading.
Christopher Allen: Got it. And then just wanted to ask, I mean, obviously the environment looks like it's trending positively in a number of different areas and I agree with Rick in terms of the opportunity to get better. But when I think about things under your control, just automation tools have been a key focus for you. Where are we at in the rollout of products and capabilities around automation tools and the new things on the horizon and commerce are more just blocking and tackling around existing products and where are you from the customer penetration, particularly in the buy side there?
Christopher Gerosa: Sure. Automation continues to be a driver of activity on the platform. It had nothing but records across the Board in Q4, record volume of $62 billion in our Auto-X solution and then overall trades on the platform was automation accounted for 20% of total trades on our platform. So we -- not only did we see heightened growth in Q4, but overall the year of 2022 sort of record volumes of total of $220 billion in automated volumes. As we look forward in 2023, we continue to hear from our largest clients around their cost controls that they are facing, particularly given the AUM performance of 2022. So they are facing bigger and bigger tech challenges and looking to us to help outsource some of those challenges in workflow solutions like our automation tools. As I mentioned in our open remarks, we are launching in the first half of this year what we're calling Adaptive Auto-X, which is a true client algorithm which adapts to market conditions as it trades. So it's a unique solution that's being rolled out for the first time in credit trading in the U.S.
Richard McVey: Just a couple of comments to add to Chris's points is that, quantitative easing caused significant changes in client asset allocation over the last three or four years, and the net result was underweight fixed income because of the zero interest rate policies around the world that has now changed. So I think what you're seeing is the very beginning stages of people starting to reallocate into fixed income, and you see it with the mutual fund inflows kicking off the year, the retail numbers are way up, the ETF assets are growing and a lot of this is driving small tickets. Some of that retail money is coming into SMA accounts, some of it into ETFs, but all of it with just this massive growth in tickets. So it's not an option to automate, it's a requirement. And I think we're going to continue to invest in tools to help our clients with that. And I would expect a very robust year of automation growth this year. On the institutional side, the other thing I would add, Chris, is that we are still seeing as a result of the massive amount of trading opportunity that's now in our Open Trading order books significant increases in market participants, both in market makers as well as systematic credit funds. So all of this points to the fact that fixed income is a better investing and trading environment now than it was for years due to quantitative easing and that's one of the reasons that we're excited about 2023.
Christopher Allen: Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. Chris Concannon, yes. You mentioned a comment about flexibility to fine tune your pricing over time in relation to Open Trading, right now where you're adding the most value to clients. I guess, how much room do you think there might be to fine tune that pricing over time and how do you kind of balance potentially making pricing changes with maintaining pricing and trying to incentivize as much flow as possible to move in that direction?
Chris Concannon: Well, first of all, we're very careful about how we adjust pricing historically and over time. We do want to continue to deliver that high value execution quality that you see in Open Trading. The value of open trading gets sizable across product. We saw the value being delivered in high-yield in particular, which increased the demand for our high-yield Open Trading offering given the growth rates in high-yield and OT of over 40% and the overall growth rate of our high-yield offering. I would say we're very careful about fine tuning pricing, particularly around OT, but we're confident in the flexibility that we have given the sizable savings that we talked about in the opening remarks.
Kyle Voigt: And to be clear, were pricing adjustments made already or are they planned for 2023?
Chris Concannon: We have not announced any pricing plans for 2023. We're quite comfortable with the current dynamic of our capture rate, because as behaviors change, and we saw that the behaviors changed obviously in 2022 to our detriment and capture in high-grade, but as those behaviors change in 2023 we're confident that the pricing opportunity that we have in 2023 is quite positive given the behavioral changes that we're already seeing.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. and just for a followup, just taking a step back, if we were going to kind of rewind maybe five years ago and think about the opportunity that you had in high-grade and high-yield from a market share standpoint, I don't think anyone would have guessed that you would have effectively had the same market share in both as we sit here today. So I guess the first part of the question is, just given the different liquidity dynamics in these two markets, do you still think that high-grade total electronic share will ultimately settle at a higher level than high-yield over the long-term? And just to follow up on Chris Allen's earlier question, is there some level of market share where it just gets harder for a single player to gain incremental share? Is that playing into anything that's happening in high-grade at all, because obviously the high-yield dynamics seem much different right now with the momentum there?
Chris Concannon: So first on electronic share and electronic adoption across the fixed income market, I do see that over, we will see differences in adoption across the various products that we offer. So obviously investment grade has seen the highest adoption of electronic trading, high-yield is growing rapidly, particularly on our platform. If you look at emerging markets, the opportunity is one of the largest opportunities globally. But we're seeing higher adoption rates there, particularly in 2022, where we have record shares, record share in both TRACE and global EM market share, estimated market share. I think munis is probably one of the most interesting product for electronic market share is probably in the most need of electronic adoption, particularly given the size of the average ticket in munis and we've seen -- we had a record year of adoption in munis, both record market share and record ADV. I would say that we look at it holistically across the entire fixed income landscape, not just one product. Our clients don't trade just high-grade. They trade across the entire fixed income landscape. So when they -- we think about electronic adoption, it certainly can achieve in my view, the 90% rate that we see in other asset classes, because at one point in the electronic adoption evolution you get to a point where you have to go all the way, not just part of the way, and your workflows become fully automated and fully electronic. So I predict very much higher levels of electronic adoption across high-grade, high-yield, emerging markets, and in particular munis and obviously we think we will play a key role in that. When our clients are outsourcing trading solutions, they're not studying market share by product like we all do. They're studying that solution and the quality of execution that's being delivered on the other side. Hopefully that answers your question.
Richard McVey: Just one, add on too, Kyle. I think with high-yield in particular, the liquidity challenges in the U.S. credit markets were most pronounced in high-yield and that plays right to our favor. And what I think it's showing you is that when liquidity is challenging, Open Trading is significantly differentiated from any other way of conducting trades in the high-yield market or elsewhere. And anecdotally, you'll hear stories of challenges in inventory, in the leverage loan market, in the high-yield market that creates constraints around balance sheet for secondary trading and the high-yield market, I just think is another data point that shows that we have a unique solution for liquidity through Open Trading that people are not able to find elsewhere. And I think that just positions us great for market share gains for many years to come because of the investments that we have made there.
Kyle Voigt: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: The next question is from Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gautam Sawant: Good morning, Rick, Chris, and Chris. I had a quick question on RFQ-hub. Can you provide us an update on the build out of that platform and how we should think about incremental future volume contributions from the ETF channel?
Richard McVey: Sure. Happy to take that one. So RFQ-hub, just a reminder, it is owned and operated by Virtu and I don't want to jump ahead of their earnings call on activity levels for RFQ-hub. We are excited about what we've seen thus far from RFQ-hub and our investment in RFQ-hub and the year that it had in 2022 just in terms of client activity, client engagement, and the work we've been doing with the partners in RFQ-hub, both our dealer partners and obviously BlackRock as a key partner as well. We do think the demand for fixed income ETFs by our institutional clients is climbing. It's a wonderful vehicle for dealing with capital flows to get exposure to the overall credit market quickly and through a liquid instrument. So we're seeing heightened levels and heightened demand from our client base on fixed income ETFs and expect that to continue, particularly given the activities in 2023 and the attractiveness of the fixed income market as an investment vehicle going forward. So we're very happy about the overall opportunity that the ETF market provides us through our investment in RFQ-hub.
Gautam Sawant: Thank you. And just as a follow-up question, I wanted to circle back to the commentary around fee per million. You've said that in the deck it's up Corporate Bond Index duration is up 6% from the lows of October. Have you seen that trend kind of continue into January with some of the new issuance changes in the marketplace and some of the trading dynamics changing?
Chris Concannon: No, the index itself has been relatively stable to the exit rate that we saw in December.
Gautam Sawant: Got it. Thank you.
Chris Concannon: Yep.
Operator: The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein: Hey everybody, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I had a bit of a market structure question for you guys. So as you look at the accelerating shift from active bond mutual funds into ETFs which again continues to accelerate here, even year-to-date, I think over 70% flows into fixed income are going ETFs. How do you think that impacts turnover rates for the credit markets? And the reason why I ask is, naturally that creates secondary degree of liquidity in the kind of the ETF wrapper, but I wonder if that also impacts positively or negatively turnover in the underlying bonds, especially when the flows are so concentrated with the handful of players, particularly with BlackRock?
Christopher Gerosa: Great question Alex and we obviously are well positioned as we think about inflows into the fixed income market, as you point out we're seeing inflows into the ETF fixed income market in particular. We're also seeing inflows into SMA products as well across the fixed income landscape. Both of those inflows, both ETFs and SMA products leave us well positioned for 2023 as we see continued attractiveness in the fixed income products as investment vehicles. In particular around ETF inflows it's a wonderful situation for us, given our position with ETF market makers. Some of the largest ETF market makers are very strong clients of MarketAxess and in particular play a major role in our Open Trading offering. So we feel like we're well positioned to take advantage of inflows into the fixed income ETF market. It also justifies our investment in RFQ-hub that we were talking earlier and the attractiveness of having an ETF execution solution as a part of our overall offering. But again, turning to the SMA opportunity, these are -- SMAs are growing. We saw growth in 2022, despite some of the challenges in the fixed income market and as we go into 2023, we'd expect the SMA account to grow as well. Those deliver very small tickets in terms of the workflow that comes through institutional clients and that heightens the demand for our automation solution. So we're excited about the overall market environment in fixed income as an investment vehicle and the growth in AUM back into fixed income are coming into those two main products, where we think we're well positioned.
Richard McVey: And Alex, I'll just add onto that too, is that while standalone the turnover of an ETF portfolio is likely to be lower than an actively managed portfolio, that's only really part of the story because the ETF share liquidity is adding to the overall liquidity of the fixed income market and giving dealers and investors another way to transfer risk quickly. So I view it as very positive for overall liquidity and activity because of that tool as a way to quickly transfer risk. And don't forget, there are a whole group of industry participants that are now actively trading the shares versus the underlying bonds, which is additive to velocity. So I think you have to take a holistic view as how that, how the growth in ETFs is adding to the fixed income ecosystem in order to get a valid outlook in terms of what it means for velocity.
Alex Blostein: Yes, that will make sense. My second question was just a quick follow up, I think to the last question around the fee capture, right? So I think I heard you guys say that you continue to see positive trends in fee capture into January. Could you dissect that a bit between IG and the rest of the business? So in other words, like is this a function of a mix where maybe high-yield is quite active and that's what's driving your comments around positive fee capture, or you're actually starting to see an improvement in the underlying IG capture rate as well?
Christopher Gerosa: Yes, no, I think it's the latter. It's really the high-grade fee capture is directly impacted by the market conditions. And when we talk about the developments were going back to October when Rick pointed out that the Corporate Bond Index duration was a low, and we've seen a strong recovery going through November and December. And I sized up the math of a year-over-year comparison. But when you look at the bond yield movement and years to maturity so far in January that we put on a chart relative to December, the high-grade fee capture was more or less at the same level. We saw the exit rate as of December.
Alex Blostein: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Daniel Fannon: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to followup on just the non-transactional revenue, just thinking about 2023 and what, as you think about info services and post-trade, what are the kind of good growth rates or appropriate growth rates to think about for the next 12 months or beyond?
Richard McVey: Yes, Dan great question. I'm glad you asked it, because we mentioned in our prepared remarks that some of the data contracts that we signed were towards the back end of Q4. And I mentioned in the last call that our target was to hit an FX adjusted growth rate of 10%. We fell just short of that, and a lot of that was due to the timing of when we signed those contracts. But the good news for the 2023 outlook, we think that the growth rates will be in the 10% to 12% range for information services on a constant currency basis and we hope to do better than that. And with respect to the post-trade, that continues to be a mid-single-digit growth rate. We're not expecting any significant upside, as you've seen in the past due to the acquisition of Reg Reporting Hub.
Christopher Gerosa: And I'll just add, we'll continue to see demand for our CP+ products particularly across high-grade, high-yield and now EM where CP+ provides a level of transparency that is hard to achieve with any other product out there on the market. We're also excitingly rolling out CP+ for treasuries and my personal favorite CP+ for munis, a market that needs more real-time transparency and we're excited for those two products to be out in the market during 2023, so some exciting new products, where we're seeing a lot of the growth of our market data revenue in the suite of CP+ products.
Daniel Fannon: Great. That's helpful. And then just on the expense guidance in the context of what you guys are characterizing as certainly an improving environment from a revenue perspective. So the midpoint at 10% maybe dissect that a little bit in terms of where those incremental dollars are going and if we're going to, if revenues come in, maybe above what your base case is, is that just flow through to compensation or are there other areas where you would spend more if the environment is constructive from a revenue perspective?
Chris Concannon: Yes. So operating expenses, we've always talked about the fixed variable mix being 16% to 17% variable and what contributes to variable expense? It's really three line items. It's our cash incentive bonus pool. We have some treasury licensing fees that are directly pegged to the treasury business, and we have our self-clearing line item. And I'm happy to say that we've employed a very disciplined approach with the challenging operating environment in 2022. We're continuing to manage that disciplined approach in 2023, and we've had some success with lowering some variable fees directly correlated to the clearing business. So I think as you see the Open Trading business grow, we're going to see operating leverage come through on that line item. So just to help size up the math, on 16% to 17% of that total operating expense base is variable with the balance being fixed. And to the question on which line items are that 10% being attributed to compensation is going to be the biggest uplift year-over-year, which is around, mid-teens growth rate then you have your T&E resuming to more normalized levels, which is about a mid-teens growth rate. On the page, we put directly what the depreciation and amortization is 10% of $40 million is $4 million. And in the balance stand across it is 1% to 2% across all the other line items on the income statement, with the exception of clearing that will be pegged to our growth in Open Trading. I hope it helps you dissect, where you need to allocate that $40 million across the income statement.
Daniel Fannon: Yes, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys:
BestEx: And then just more broadly on the regulatory backdrop, what are some of the key regulations, proposals perhaps that are maybe on the horizon that you guys are tracking and that could be impactful for your business? I know in the past we've talked about all-to-all trading and rates as well as potential treasury clearing.
Chris Concannon: Sure, thanks Michael. And I would say nothing meaningful in terms of what has come out from the SEC so far. I think I'm right in saying that a lot of the best execution revisions were focused on dealer obligations as fiduciary and agency trading. So not quite as relevant around the world of fixed income, but we do expect something much more material at some point during 2023, which is what I would view as long overdue revisions to the fixed income electronic trading and ATS rules, and something that I was directly involved in promoting and supporting as part of FIMSAC at the SEC when the industry participants were helping the commission think through that. So what I'm looking forward to is really a level playing field with standardized e-trading rules across the ATS community. The staff continues to do their work on that. So we're not exactly sure what the timing will be but, I would expect that those fixed income ATS rules will be out sometime during calendar year 2023.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thanks. And just a followup question, just curious, your latest thoughts on M&A here just given the rising cash balance, where that might be most additive to the platform and how you think about enhancing connectivity to clients including retail clients, now that fixed income and particular retail fixed income is becoming more in vogue.
Christopher Gerosa: So we obviously look at the coming 2023 as an opportunity given the re-pricing of many financial assets a number of small companies. When we look at the marketplace, there is what I call scarcity of assets. So we're really talking about an M&A strategy that involves much smaller size bolt-on type of product offerings. The FinTech space has clearly been repriced. So there's an opportunity and there are a number of FinTech providers in the market that will start facing capital challenges in the year ahead. So with a very strong balance sheet, we feel well positioned to take advantage of a re-priced market with a number of FinTech players that may be in need of capital. So excited about what's ahead, but again, there's nothing material out there given the scarcity of assets that we look at.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Just why don't you to ask about execution quality and the price improvement that you're getting for your clients in particularly regards to portfolio trading versus some of your more, legacy protocols like list trading. I guess first of all, to what extent do you think the price improvement is better in some of the other protocols outside of portfolio trading and that will limit PTs share or is that not really an issue and the clients are more focused on getting the trade execution done?
Richard McVey: So it's a great question, Brian. I view portfolio trading as really a demand for liquidity and capital because these are very sizable trades that our clients are in need of, so they're demanding higher levels of capital commitment from our dealer partners. And so I do think that portfolio trading done in comp or in dealer competition, which is what our electronic solution offers our clients does result in a better execution quality across the full portfolio. We also rolled out analytics and will continue to roll out analytics that help our clients judge how portfolios are being priced relative to either an individual or a list trade, however you want to call it. So we think clients are being given all the proper tools to evaluate portfolio trading as a large block trade or as an individual or list trade, where they get the participation of additional market participants. So right now, portfolio trading, we see it, it has grown. It has grown over the last couple of years. We do see that growth rate flattening at some point depending on market dynamics. More importantly, what we're seeing in the first quarter is obviously smaller trade sizes. So the demand for more trading activity at smaller size is probably going to be a theme that we see in 2023, and that's where many of the other list trading and other alternative protocols that we offer come into demand. So while we do see strength in portfolio trading as inflows come in, many times our clients are using the portfolio trade as a way to get instant exposure, and they pay for that capital utilization from very large dealers.
Brian Bedell: Great. That's great color. And then just -- go ahead.
Chris Concannon: If I could just add, we're one, we're really pleased with the growth in PT we've seen on MarketAxess and the ability to give clients their choice depending on the, the risk that they're trying to move. I will say, and we previewed this a year ago that as volatility has picked up, don't forget the dealer side, it's become much more difficult to manage the risk of large portfolios from the dealer side and I think there have been two outcomes of that in 2022. One is that the growth rate of portfolio trading volume has slowed dramatically. And if you look at the last 12 months, it's been right around 5.5% of secondary TRACE volume over the last year. And it's been even slower than that in high yield, where the liquidity challenges are more severe. So the growth rates of PT volume are down, but also, we see greater concentration in terms of the dealers that are printing portfolio traits than we did a year ago. And I think that's just it, the level of sophistication that's required to manage that risk is way up because of volatility. So all those factors weigh in terms of the quality of the pricing that comes through in PT, and as a result of client behavior on where they think they're going to get best execution.
Brian Bedell: That's very interesting. Thanks for that color. And then just one follow up on the ETF substitution, a number of questions were asked on that. Obviously definitely improves velocity, but how do you think about the nature of the client base that's using that in terms of, I guess, revenue capture? So the punch line of the question is, does the greater velocity more than offset any diminution of revenue capture or is the revenue capture pretty similar to your overall fixed income trading in investment grid?
Christopher Gerosa: Well, I'll start by thinking about the velocity first. I mean when you think about ETF activities on the equity markets, fixed income ETF activities on the equity markets, there is a direct correlation to activity in open trading, but across the overall fixed income market. And so, as you mentioned, velocity does increase with the level of inflows into fixed income ETFs. The other important point is, and it goes back to the levels of electronic trading in the fixed income market, as ETFs become a dominant product of choice by investors, the demand for electronic trading goes up because those ETF market makers need to hedge in an electronic capacity. They are executing electronically in the equity market, the transfer of that risk is best done in electronic form in the fixed income or the underlying market. So we do see a very strong connection between velocity and ETFs and velocity in electronic trading in the fixed income market. We also see a number of new participants in the ETF market that are leveraging our Open Trading solution from systematic hedge funds, alternative hedge funds, and the ETF market makers see huge benefits of leveraging a broader network in the fixed income market, a broader network than they are they typically have access to. So again, Open Trading is certainly a wonderful tool for the average ETF market maker and any systematic hedge fund that's using ETFs as an investment vehicle.
Brian Bedell: That's super helpful and congrats to you, Chris and Rick as well.
Christopher Gerosa: Thanks.
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Mr. McVey for any closing remarks.
Richard McVey: Thanks for joining us this morning and we look forward to updating you on business trends next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-19 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on October 19, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company. Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiatives, and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. We continue to execute our growth strategy and delivered the second consecutive quarter of record market share gains across nearly all of our products, strong increases in trading volumes, and significant execution cost savings for clients through our unique all-to-all trading protocol Open Trading. Our dealer and institutional investor clients are facing very challenging credit market trading conditions and our focus is delivering value for them to help navigate through elevated market volatility. And through these challenging markets, our leadership position in global credit continues to expand beyond just U.S. high grade with record estimated market share in high yield and municipal bonds in the U.S., record share in Eurobonds and accelerating share gains in emerging markets. The breadth of our global market share gains continues to expand in this volatile market. Engagement of institutional investors and dealers on our platform continues to increase with a record of nearly 2,000 active client firms and a record number of active traders. We have seen especially strong growth in our international business with nearly 1,000 client firms now active including strong growth in Asia. As traditional sources of liquidity have become scarce, the importance of our diversified liquidity pool increases, and further enhances our leading market position. It is encouraging to see institutional clients and dealers leaning into MarketAxess across so many products during a period of challenging liquidity. We are also making excellent strides in developing new growth cylinders with another record quarter in municipal bond trading volume and a record quarter in portfolio trading volume. In U.S. Treasuries, there were 226 active client firms trading on the platform, up from 122 in the prior year as we continue to gain traction with investors in our unique all-to-all treasury solution. U.S. corporate and emerging markets debt outstanding in the market has been growing at three-year compound growth rates of approximately 4% and 9%, respectively, which, when combined with higher rates, sets a strong foundation for trading growth in the institutional client e-trading space. In summary, the breadth of our business has never been stronger with accelerating growth in trading volume, new market share records, increasing momentum in new product areas and a growing addressable market opportunity. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Just one year ago on our earnings call, we stated that Central Bank tapering would lead to a more normalized yield levels and volatility in the bond markets around the world, and that is exactly what has happened. In a very short 10-month period, we have moved from massive Central Bank quantitative easing to the current state of Central Bank quantitative tightening due to the elevated levels of inflation. We have seen a rapid increase in yields around the world and investment-grade bond indices are down a remarkable 22% year-to-date. While current trading conditions are extremely volatile, we believe higher bond yields create a better investing and trading environment. We maintained our view that bond trading velocity will grow in the years ahead due to growing bond market participation and increased adoption of trading automation. What we did not predict was historically rapid rise in interest rates, driving one of the steepest declines in corporate bond duration dropping 18% year-over-year. This reduction in duration has had a negative impact on our high-grade fee capture which is the only bond product that institutional investors trade in yield instead of price. At the same time, the U.S. dollar index moved to 20-year highs in a short period of time. Despite these short-term revenue headwinds, our overall revenue growth trends have improved materially in the last few quarters and we would expect both the duration and FX revenue headwinds to diminish in the future as market conditions stabilize. In the very early weeks of Q4, total credit and rates, average daily volume is running similar to September levels and well above last October. Slide 5 shows the strong year-over-year increases in estimated market share and the magnitude of our share gains since the pre-pandemic period. This is the second consecutive quarter of top quartile market share gains as compared to our long-term average year-over-year share gains. All but one of our primary products were in the top quartile of historical data for year-over-year quarterly growth versus the past 10 years. We focus on the longer-term trends, and as illustrated on this slide, we have grown market share by almost 550 basis points per product since the third quarter of 2019, which equates to an annual increase of approximately 180 basis points across products. These growth rates reflect the strength of our franchise and underpin our confidence in our ability to capture the market opportunity in front of us. Slide 6 illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing. The strong market share gains we delivered this quarter only served to reinforce the sizable revenue and earnings opportunity that we have ahead of us. We have a unique position in large and growing global debt markets. We are leveraging our global client network and technology to grow share in existing products and add new product areas to the platform. And as we grow market share, our data and content become even more valuable which makes us even more excited about the many ways that we are pursuing the data and ETF opportunity. We believe we can capture this opportunity and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments in new initiatives.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Rick. Slide 8 provides an update on Open Trading. The benefits of Open Trading are coming through in the form of significant increases in execution cost savings for our clients. The importance of all-to-all trading is clearly shown in the record percentage of our global trade volumes benefiting from price improvement. Open Trading price improvement generated $260 million in estimated transaction cost savings delivered to our clients in Q3, double the savings levels from one year ago. We believe that the market is moving in our direction because of the benefits of all-to-all trading. We are also innovating and bringing this model to the U.S. Treasury and municipal bond space. One of the largest fixed income asset managers in the world, PIMCO, recently released a viewpoint piece suggesting that the entire U.S. treasury market would benefit from a shift to all-to-all trading. We agree with their view. A record 1,800 unique firms or over 90% of our active client base executed at least one trade through our Open Trading network during the quarter. This dynamic is clearly shown by the data with record overall Open Trading penetration of 37% and record high-yield Open Trading penetration of 53%. Slide 9 highlights the increasing momentum we are seeing with automation in credit trading. Automated trading increased to $52 billion in volume and over 290,000 trades in Q3, reflecting continued strong adoption during a period of heightened volatility. This speaks to the increasing comfort that dealers and investor clients have using our tools and their confidence in our CP+ data fee. Today, Auto-X represents 18% of total trade count and 7% of our credit trading volume. We are also seeing record Auto-Responder trading volume where our clients are optimizing their execution quality. Additionally, the use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 6 million algo responses in the third quarter, up 33% from the same period last year. The impressive three-year CAGR shown on this slide reflect the strong long-term growth of our trade automation suite. As the use of automation tools increases, we believe we will see an impact on trading velocity over time. Slide 10 illustrates our growth in portfolio trading. The third quarter was another record for portfolio trading with total volume of $25 billion. We delivered this strong performance through continued international diversification. Eurobond's portfolio trading volume doubled in the quarter and EM portfolio trading volume was up over 20% sequentially. EMEA-based clients executed approximately 30% of our portfolio trading volume in the quarter. Estimated high-grade and high-yield portfolio trading market volumes have remained relatively flat at around 5% to 6% of secondary trading over the last several quarters. Slide 11 is an update on emerging markets where we continue to see strong growth in local markets and market share. We achieved 8% growth in emerging markets trading volume during the quarter, 12% growth on a constant currency basis. Local markets' trading volume of $60 billion increased 33% on a reported basis and 47% on a constant currency basis. We continue to onboard new clients with record 1,376 active clients trading EM on the platform, and we traded in 28 of our 30 local markets. 80% of the emerging market opportunity is in local markets, which is a huge and growing market for us. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Gerosa to provide an update on our financials.
Chris Gerosa: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 13, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. Third quarter revenue was $172 million, up 6% driven by strong growth in trading volume and record market share gains, but was negatively impacted by the lower duration of U.S. high-grade bonds traded and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenues would have increased approximately 9%. All else equal, and assuming the same level of trading volume, we estimate that the change in U.S. high-grade duration lowered our third quarter revenue by approximately $8 million. Information Services revenue was up 1% or 10% excluding the impact of FX. We continue to expect our full year 2022 information services revenue growth rate to hit our historical growth levels of around 10% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter post-trade revenue included the negative impact of approximately $1.7 million on a strengthening U.S. dollar compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of FX and onetime revenue activity in the quarter, the year-over-year growth rate would have been approximately 8%. The increase in other income was principally due to higher investment income of $1.3 million as we are benefiting from a more attractive interest rate environment and a $900,000 gain on our equity investment. We expect other income in the next few quarters to increase slightly as we plan to benefit from higher investment yields on our cash and deposit balances. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, and we are reconfirming that we expect the full year effective tax rate to be at the upper end of the previously stated range of 24% to 26%. On Slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fees per million. Total commission revenue increased 7%. Our growth in total credit and total rates commission revenue was driven by healthy increases in our trading volume and estimated market share, but was partially offset by lower average fee capture across U.S. high grade. The lower high-grade fee capture was driven principally by higher bond yields. The weighted average years to maturity of bonds traded in U.S. high grade has remained stable year-over-year on the platform. On Slide 15, we provide you with our expense detail. Third quarter expenses increased 9% driven principally by investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Excluding the impact of FX, expenses would have increased 13%. Employee compensation and benefits increased $4 million on an increase in head count mainly in technology and customer-facing roles to support revenue growth initiatives. Technology and communications expense increased $4 million on higher software subscriptions, cloud hosting expense and technology licensing fees. Professional and consulting expenses decreased $3 million driven by lower acquisition-related consulting expenses and lower recruiting fees. Given the progression of operating expenses and the impact of FX fluctuations year-to-date, we are refining our full year 2022 expense guidance range to $390 million to $398 million from the previously stated range of $385 million to $415 million. The new midpoint would imply 9% growth year-over-year. On Slide 16, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of September 30, our cash and investments were $352 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $239 million. We are refining our full year 2022 CapEx guidance range of $58 million to $62 million to a range of $48 million to $52 million mainly due to a transition from purchasing to leasing fixed assets and the FX impact on our international investments. During the third quarter, we paid out $26 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 280,000 shares for a total of $88 million, $100 million remains on the outstanding repurchase authorization. Our Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend of $0.70, which was based on the financial performance of the company. Now let me turn the call back to Rick.
Richard McVey: Thank you, Chris. In summary, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy and are pulling all the levers within our control. We delivered record levels of market share and enhanced our competitive position in the institutional client e-trading space, both in the U.S. and on the international front. Our global footprint continues to broaden and deepen as we diversify our product offering and achieve record growth in active clients. .The market is increasingly turning to our unique Open Trading solution for liquidity and significant price improvement and the market opportunity before us continues to expand. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Richard Repetto: Yes good morning, Rick and Chris and Chris. I guess the first question is on the market share gains and U.S. high yields have some significant gains really starting probably last quarter. But I guess Rick, the question is, can you characterize what's driving that and is it similar to the U.S. high grade market volatility and market share gains you saw it like early in the pandemic? Is it the similar situation of liquidity demand?
Richard McVey: It certainly is Rich - if you look at our high grade and high yield bid-ask indices, they are near - they are approximately double where we were a year ago and already at about 80% to 85% of where they were in March of 2020. So liquidity conditions are incredibly challenging. And as a result, clients are leaning on the all-to-all trading model that we have developed in high yield for diversified sources of liquidity and price improvement. So I'd say it's obviously a completely different model that we run in all-to-all trading. And the consistency of delivering price improvement is what's driving high yield clients and dealers to execute more of their volume with us on the platform.
Richard Repetto: Got it. And one follow-up, Rick. This is on the treasury market and regulatory proposed changes to clearing central clearing. So if I had to sum up and you correct me if I'm wrong, but the proposed rules from the SEC would require central clearing of treasuries from a wider audience, including proprietary traders and hedge funds. And what do you see as the impact on the - I guess, the treasury marketplace if that was to occur, and do I have it correct, I guess to sum up the proposal?
Richard McVey: Chris, do you want to take the first cut at that?
Chris Concannon: Sure, Rich, and I have to say you're reading the proposal like a lawyer that was an accurate summary. The way we view the SEC's proposal is, the policy goals of the proposal are sound. The market will benefit from centralizing clearing at DTC of treasury activity, because of the net settlement benefits that DTC provides and the guaranteed settlement that DTC provides. So organizing the market to have more centralized clearing is favorable to the overall market. I think the key piece of the proposal is how we get there. And there are steps, the way that proposal is structured, because it's really a rule change to - that supports the clearing agencies proposed rule changes. There are some benefits embedded in the customer protection rules that the SEC are proposing for clearing firms to allow them to have more favorable capital treatment if they're clearing on behalf of other broker dealers, particularly the proprietary trading firms. So I do think we're at least a year or two away from the final implementation of the clearing agency rules. Remember, the SEC has to approve the rules, and then the clearing agencies have to file their own rules to comply with the proposed rule so a few steps away. There's still obviously some discussion around the repo proposal that the SEC incorporated into the overall clearing proposal. Again, the policy benefits are sound, it's really the steps that we get that we use to get for the final outcome. So there are some impacts, but I do think we are ways away from the final implementation of the other goals of the proposal.
Richard Repetto: Got it. I'll take that lawyer comment as a positive. I'm usually suspect of any lawyers of those of lawyer degrees, Chris.
Chris Concannon: I always think highly of lawyers, just try not to be around them as much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Allen. Your line is open.
Christopher Allen: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about fee per million, which has been obviously a bit of an overhang on the stock. I wonder if you could maybe give us some color just in terms of how fee per million progressed over the course of the quarter, specifically around high grade, you start to see some stability there? Any other dynamics, whether it's an EM that's going on local versus hard currencies? And also what was the thought process on pulling back on the disclosure there in terms of breaking it up between the different products?
Chris Gerosa: Hey, Chris, so I'll get into the technical discussion of the sequential decline - or I should say we're stable, relatively speaking for total credit. And then the charts that we provide in the deck, I mean, we provide the view of what the years to maturity and bond yields look like from a 3Q perspective and - on Slide 4 of the deck, there was some pressure on high grade fee capture giving the movement in the years to maturity was down slightly and bond yields were up slightly. But just to remind you that the technical merits of that is every 100 basis point move in bond yields is around a $4 impact on fee capture and every one year to maturity is around $14 to $15. So there were movements and there was slight pressure on high grade fee capture. But relatively speaking, it was stable to the Q2 exit levels. And what we're seeing so far in October is around the same. Of the $16 decline in total credit fee capture, roughly 60% of that was due to the duration impact from high grade and the balance of the 40% was due to product and protocol mix. So high grade was a bigger impact, but there were other variables that were contributing to that as well. And that was a year-over-year comparison, Chris, I know you asked about the sequential, but I just wanted to hit the year-over-year decline.
Richard McVey: And on the second half of your question, Chris, a couple of thoughts and responses there one, in one way, we've increased transparency on fee capture, because we have started to provide the total credit fee capture on a monthly basis rather than quarterly. So we think that will be well received by investors. Secondly, it's one of many examples where we were providing a lot more granularity on fee capture than the rest of the market. So we think by going to total credit fee capture, we've aligned ourselves with what we see elsewhere in the industry. And thirdly, as we've said, the vast majority of the high grade fee capture change was all due to the increase in rates and duration. And there is a publicly available data point that I would point all of you to that will show you what's going on with duration and corporate bonds. And that's the corporate bond index duration. So anyone that wants to follow it more than monthly or try to dissect high grade versus other products, there is a way to do that with the public date on the corporate bond index. So all three of those factors drove the decision to shift to monthly and go to a full credit fee capture per million.
Chris Concannon: And Chris, you mentioned EM, so I have to obviously, answer that question as well. Our EM volume in the quarter is up about - 7.7% over Q3 last year. And that's in the face of market volumes being down. But as you mentioned, local market ADB is up 32% year-over-year. So obviously, super exciting for us to tap into that local market, it obviously has a slight impact on capture, as you notice. But overall, EM our volumes continue to grow. And we're super excited about that local market piece because it's up so large, year-over-year.
Christopher Allen: Got it, appreciate the color there. And then I guess, I just wanted to follow-up a little bit kind of on the environment, you gave some colors on high yield, just in terms of some liquidity challenges there. But maybe more so on high grade with the commentary we've kind of heard is spreads are widening up. Why isn't trading activity better? This is a function of clients waiting for - from a picture of the economy. Are there other factors involved are there - they are outflows impacting activity? I'm just trying to think about what's the potential catalysts ahead to improve the environment from - specifically on the high-grade side?
Richard McVey: Yes, the high-grade market volumes are actually holding up reasonably well year-to-date given the extreme volatility in the market and the challenges with liquidity. You actually see the market volume challenges more clearly in the international products, and a huge part of that is just the FX translation back into dollars in our reporting. But there - in EM, in particular, you have a risk-off environment you clearly have had outflows in bond funds. I don't think most investors are used to these kind of price changes in corporate bond mutual funds and ETFs. It's not anything I've ever seen in my career. And in fact, in the last 20 years, if you look at the high-grade index, the worst year we've had was down about 4%, and here we are down 22% year-to-date. So it has driven some outflows as well. So I think all of those factors are at work. We still feel very strongly that debt in the world is going to continue to grow as it has been. And we really feel that the increase in participation in automation over time will increase velocity, but there are a number of factors that are contributing to some challenges in the very near term on market volume growth.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gautam Sawant: Hi, good morning. One of the key differentiators of the MarketAxess platform is value-added data. Can you speak to recent enhancements to your data and analytics capabilities? And if there's been any pricing changes to your offering?
Chris Concannon: Sure. So on the data front, obviously, we have our premier product, CP+ and Axess All, two products that are obviously used by a large community of both dealers and clients. We continue to see high demand for both products but particularly in CP+ because we've rolled out additional product for CP+. So not only do we have CP+ for U.S. corporates, but we also have it for Eurobonds, EM. We've now launched a CP+ for treasuries and EGBs as well. So we see growing demand as we as we grow market share as well as we roll out additional products. We're looking at future launches in municipals as an opportunity as well, and working on that. The other area that has been growing interest from a data perspective by our clients are what I'll call portfolio construction data. And that's really how we help our clients to select the right bonds based on liquidity and activity in the market when they're constructing their portfolio. An example of this is used in our MarketAxess 400 Index where we select bonds - 400 bonds in the investment grade space. That are the most liquid bonds across our platform. So we use that data to construct the investment-grade index, the MarketAxess 400. It's now been launched into an ETF [LQIG] in partnership with State Street. So we're super excited about being able to take our data on our platform and to convert it into portfolio construction. And we're seeing higher and higher demand from our clients around that unique data that they can use on a daily basis to help construct the most liquid portfolio, particularly given the liquidity challenges that we're seeing in the market in this time.
Gautam Sawant: Got it. And just as a follow-up, as you consider the narrowed expense range, excluding some of the FX benefits, where are expenses coming in below your initial estimates? And could you expect to see any of those expense benefits carry into next year?
Chris Gerosa: Yes. The rationale behind tightening the range was really driven by the FX impact. And we provide good disclosure in our 10-Qs on the market risk liquidity section, where every 10% move in exchange rates, particularly around the sterling and the euro is going to be around a $10 million impact on operating expenses. So it's not as if we've pulled back the investment strategy. We're continuing to invest in the platform and changing our investment philosophy from leasing as compared to purchasing. But all that's doing is just shifting our spend across the income statement. But the FX was a headwind for us, and we just felt it was appropriate to tighten the range for the investment community.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is Michael on for Alex. Maybe just following up on that. there was a meaningful step up in tech and communication spend this quarter. And I think the press release referenced enhancements of trading systems as well as higher subscription and licensing costs. Where are you guys making incremental investments? And should we still think about 10% to 12% over the next few years? Or -- and what extra investment are required to support that growth range? Thanks.
Chris Gerosa: Yes. So we called it out. It's around our cloud investing, licensing for our platforms that support our U.S. Treasury business. IT security is a big investment area for us. And as we think about the 2023 expense guidance, we're in the early days of our budget planning, but the preliminary outlook is that we're going to see around 10% year-over-year growth in operating expenses. And that's assuming, of course, that we're looking at an exchange rate around today's levels. So that's subject to change depending on where the foreign currency markets take us.
Richard McVey: I would just say in terms of our -- what's driving our desire to continue investing is the -- what we see in client behavior and adoption of all the new products and protocols that we're delivering to the market. And in addition to our core business market share gains being well above average, we're really encouraged with the progress that we're making in municipal bonds and government bonds, and clearly now have a competitive offering and portfolio trading as well. And we're super excited about the share gains that we see internationally, and how big the emerging markets and euro opportunity is. So our view is that we're getting all the right signals that our clients want to automate more of their fixed income trading around the world. And we have an opportunity to continue to do more with existing products and also add additional products in the years ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. Maybe shifting gears a little bit. Can you help us understand how much of the high-yield revenue might be coming from ETF market makers, specifically in the quarter, and maybe how that's changed versus 2021? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: So obviously, ETF market makers are an important part of our overall market across all of our products, not just high yield. Our Open Trading -- a record Open Trading market share of penetration of 53% is certainly reflective of seeing alternative liquidity providers stepping up and filling the gaps of liquidity in the market as other traditional liquidity providers are more challenged from a balance sheet perspective. We don't give out overall statistics on any one segment, particularly our ETF market makers, but they are a strong partner to us and strong partners in the liquidity that they provide to our clients. So I would expect ETF market makers to continue to grow on the platform. If you look at the growth of the ETF market and the new product offerings being delivered to that market, we would expect higher correlations As more products come into market, we would expect higher correlations of ETF market makers being part of our market. The other thing to point out is all of the large investment banks have sizable ETF market-making presence. So there's really no way to discern what is ETF market making anymore and what is separate type of investment bank, traditional client to deal with business. So it's -- everybody is in the ETF space, including some of our hedge fund clients. So to try and triangulate what that really is, is quite difficult to do.
Richard McVey: And I just would remind you -- and you see in high yield that over half the volume is going through open trading. There are three main sources of that liquidity, and they are all growing. One is what we call the alternative market-making community, and a lot of those are ETF market-making participants. The second is just allowing more dealers to compete for order flow efficiently. And those are dealers anywhere in the world that have market-making businesses that may not have counterparty relationships with clients that are utilizing our platform, but they can compete for order flow here. The third, and I think the most interesting long term is that in environments like this, when liquidity is challenging, we're seeing more opportunistic investors leading with price and being the price and liquidity provider. And all three of those different segments are contributing to the diversification of liquidity that we see. And the best example of that, as you point out, is in our high-yield marketplace. .
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Daniel Fannon: Thanks. Appreciate the time. Just wanted to follow up again on high yield. Just thinking about sustainability of some of the share gains and what you were just talking about with some of the momentum. But looking at the comparison to the beginning of the pandemic with high grade and the benefits of your platform seas and that it normalizes as spreads come back to a more normal territory. Would you anticipate some normalization in your market share, if and when kind of activity in the high yield kind of slows down and spreads tighten a bit?
Richard McVey: I do think you see fluctuations depending on the liquidity conditions in the market. But the overall trend. And that's actually why we provided a three-year view on share. So you can see even though we went through that extremely volatile period in '20 with the spike up and then some reversion in '21 when market conditions were very stable. When you look at three-year growth, the trend is pretty darn clear. And so I do think the direction of travel on share overall is positive. But in the short term, quarter-to-quarter, we will certainly see impact based on market conditions. Quite honestly, when I look out to '23, my own expectation is that it's likely that volatility is going to remain high. This is a very delicate balance for central banks around the world to try to control inflation without sending the economy into recession in a significant way. It sure looks to me like they're going to be dealing with that challenge all of next year. So our outlook on volatility is that it's likely to favor our model going into '23.
Daniel Fannon: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on capital return, it looks like buybacks were kind of halted this quarter after three quarters of relatively stable levels. Just curious on your outlook for share repurchases here.
Chris Gerosa: Yes. So our capital management strategies around share repurchases has been to offset dilution from employee equity grants. And we spent a lot of money this year, almost $90 million repurchasing 280,000 shares, which essentially accomplished two years of offsetting equity dilution from the awards we give to the employees. And what's different today, Dan, is we're in a much more attractive investment-yielding environment. So when we're thinking about deploying cash, returning value to our shareholders through higher returns on our cash balances is something that we think about as we think about our capital management strategy going forward.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back to some of the commentary around trading automation. I think you mentioned the automated trades are about 18% of trades, but 7% of volumes. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the initiatives to expand automated trading to larger trade sizes and expand usage across your customer base. Maybe you could talk about some of the hurdles, and how you're working to overcome them.
Chris Concannon: Sure. I'm happy to answer that. So obviously, as we mentioned, automation continues to grow across the platform. If you take a step back and look at the macro challenges of our clients, particularly in '22 with falling AUM, which obviously cuts their revenue, there's a need to outsource trading solutions. And so there -- we're feeling that demand from our clients to help them solve automation solutions that they need for their trading, and we're seeing that obviously in the growth with -- seeing record automation at $52 billion in the quarter, up 36% over the year. So the demand continues. The areas where we're seeing heightened interest, it's really two areas. It's the basic workflow, small execution sizes continue to grow and then also the no-touch region, which is really an API solution where there is no trader involved, the orders come in directly and they're processed. I would say Auto-Responder -- and I mentioned this in my remarks, Auto-Responder where clients are able to capture spread through an automated solution and be working in order in the market. That's where we're seeing heightened demand, particularly given the spread levels in this current market. They're all very comfortable with our data feed. It's controlled by CP+. And obviously, the adoption rates even in this volatile market has been high. The other exciting area of growth for us is in the muni space. In the quarter, we executed our first Auto-X in municipal bonds, and we see heightened demand in that area. Again, very small ticket sizes in munis, and a lot of workflow associated with the muni market. So we're super excited about what we can do not only in high-grade, high-yield Eurobonds and EM, but also in the muni space.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up with the -- on the balance sheet side, $325 million cash position. How do you think about deploying that here, prioritizing maybe buybacks, but -- or investing organically in the business, but also M&A? Where might that be helpful in terms of filling any gaps or accelerating growth in certain areas?
Chris Gerosa: Yes. So the -- I'll just repeat the investment priorities, invest in the platform, potentially some opportunistic M&A and return capital to the shareholders. And of that $350 million, when we think about cash, we also think about the investment line item. So round numbers, it's $350 million. And roughly $250 million is supporting our Open Trading business and $100 million is balanced for our working capital investment needs. But that $350 million today is earning around 3%, which is representative of Fed funds. So as we are working through our capital management strategy for 2023 in connection with our budget, we're recognizing the opportunities we have on the investment yield front and balancing that with how we're going to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and repurchase programs.
Michael Cyprys: So if I just follow-up, just really quickly there. Does that imply about $100 million of excess cash then, cash and investments?
Chris Gerosa: Yes, as of 9/30.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equity. Your line is open.
Simon Clinch: Hi. I appreciate you pick my question here. I was wondering if you could circle back to the high-grade market. And just help me understand sort of the market share trends. I mean this is the one area where, obviously, the market share trends haven't been as robust as other segments for you. And just wondering how to think about why that should be the case, given the volatility we've seen of late? What's it going to take for that to really accelerate?
Richard McVey: Yes. I think if you look at it -- a lot of it is the market shocked at investor clients have gone through this year with a significant drop in corporate bond price values and indices and the outflows that they are experiencing. I do think -- if you still look at the institutional client space, we have a meaningful lead on our competitors there. But we have lots of interesting things going to add to what we've done so successfully around RFQ. The growth in portfolio trading is clearly very relevant to us. We have not historically been competitive in the D2D space that's actually growing as dealers use electronic trading more, to move inventory more quickly through the market. We have some ideas there that we think could be successful around how to compete more effectively in D2D. And as I said, the automation tools in our mind are likely to increase both usage and velocity for trading on the platform. So it's a strong leadership position in the institutional space today, and we think we have many ideas to continue the market share gains in the years ahead.
Simon Clinch: Okay. Thanks for that. And just as a follow-up on the portfolio trading side. I know you said that the share of portfolio trading is sort of flatlined at about 5% to 6%. But actually, if you look at the numbers, it's still creeping higher. And I was kind of expecting portfolio trading to maybe retract a bit from share of volumes in a higher volatility environment given that it just becomes much harder and much riskier price for participants there. So should we just expect that figure to keep creeping high regardless of the volatility environment?
Richard McVey: Creeping higher is, I think, a good explanation of the trends in portfolio trading this year. And the growth rates in the prior two years were significantly higher. So some of the analyst expectations on growth were much higher than what we've observed this year. So yes, we think it's going to be used selectively for situations where large portfolios can be moved mostly through the dealer community. But I think you will see that volatility does impact pricing and portfolio trading, and it's becoming more concentrated too, and there was no volatility in the market. We observed more dealer market makers winning portfolio trades on MarketAxess a year ago than we do today where that liquidity has become concentrated around three or four dealers that do portfolio trading very well. So yes, our expectation would be exactly that, that it will probably creep higher in the years ahead. And we think we have continued opportunities to continue to take share.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Richard Repetto: Yes, I just have a follow-up on -- two follow-ups on questions that were asked earlier. Chris, on this treasury regulation, central clearing is good for a number of reasons, but it also requires margin. And I know it's not going to be until whenever. You said it was another year plus down the road. But could it impact trading of these proprietary traders or hedge funds, if they're required to put up margin in a centrally cleared environment?
Chris Concannon: So the way - obviously, they're trading today, they have favorable margin treatment as they're clearing outside of the central clearing house. Two things I would think would happen as you organize more volume in the central clearinghouse. Obviously, margin offsets to get created as you're netting down more of the activity that's cleared away. But also the fees that are charged, if you grow that clearing volume dramatically, and there's a sizable portion that clears outside the central clearing house. I would expect fees to be reflective of the overall volume coming into the central clearing. But it's not clear that the margin impact will be dramatic for all of the proprietary traders. There's -- one of the key elements, as I mentioned, is that we've seen a number of clearing firms, firms that clear on behalf of others step out of the market over the years because of the challenges around capital treatment for that clearing of treasury business. They're really trying to create a benefit for those clearing firms. So we'd see more clearing firms step in to clear on behalf of others, clear on behalf of those proprietary trading firms that you mentioned. So there are solutions. And the SEC is well aware of some of the capital impacts for bringing that volume back into central clearing. Again, there's a lot more detail that has to be worked out, both at the - on the proposed rules as well as when we see the clearing agencies actually draft their rules that comply with the SEC's rules. So it's a complicated step-by-step process, and there's, a number of opportunities to create favorable capital treatment for the proprietary trading firms.
Richard Repetto: Got it, thank you Chris. And then Rick, I guess the last question is, I understand the pros and cons of the disclosure and compared to what - your peers and what you've done. But I guess the question surrounds like as market share in U.S. high grade has been more stagnant lately as well as the pressure on the fee capture that - is U.S. high grade the more mature market? Is that any proxy for way other credit markets can go over time? And therefore, investors don't have the disclosure or - like I think you're still pretty positive on the opportunities in U.S. high grade as well that you spoke about on the call. So I guess the...?
Richard McVey: So positive on the market environment, the market opportunity and our transparency and I haven't had anyone challenged our view that we're the most transparent e-trading platform in the space in terms of the granularity of detail that we provide to analysts and investors. And we think we've added some important information with the monthly disclosures, and we're happy to point you to the duration factors that you need to see shifts in duration that are impacting fee capture in that product. But I - we continue to have a view that fixed income is going to follow other asset classes. I think the demand for automation with investors Rich, are noticeably higher today than they were a year ago because of the drop in asset values across asset classes. And so, our expectation is that our investment in automation and the clients' need, for it will continue to drive the share levels across all fixed income product areas in electronic trading higher in the years ahead. And I think when it's - when we look back five to 10 years from now, we're going to see, it's landed in a similar place to other asset classes with 70% to 80% of the volume taking place electronically.
Chris Concannon: And Rich, I would just add, if you really think about the growth of MarketAxess today and in the years to come, it is breadth of product that we are growing. There's not one product we're putting up records across our product categories. And we want our disclosure, which is, as Rick mentioned, far more than most of the platforms in the space. And we want that disclosure to recognize the breadth of product that we're offering, not just in investment grade capture rate. And so, we've made this adjustment. We've actually become more transparent on a monthly basis than most platforms in the space. But if you look at the overall records across the product categories, we want to make sure our disclosure reflects that breadth of products, not just one category.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi good morning. Maybe if I could just ask a question on the Eurobond business and the significant share gains there. Can you just give us an update on how much of that total market you estimate to be electronic? And from a competitive perspective, we can obviously see your share in Tradeweb share. I guess the question is, do you believe that Bloomberg is still seeing significant share in that market? And how much electronic shares left on their platform? And then I'll ask my follow-up with this one is, are you seeing Bloomberg do anything strategically to catch up in terms of investing in their offering or developing protocols in that market or should this kind of continuation of seeding share should investors expect that to kind of continue near term? Thank you.
Richard McVey: Yes, I'd happy to comment. And - of course, I think the environment has been favorable for us given the all-to-all trading benefits that we drive to Eurobonds and also EM for CEMEA market participants in a very challenging market environment. So I think that is the core competitive advantage that we have that you see coming through in our Eurobond and EM market share. Unfortunately, Kyle, it's hard to get at the number of what the true electronic share is in Europe today because I believe I'm correct in saying that both of our competitors include pure processing volume in their e-trading numbers. And so, when dealers get their reports, they're seeing the processing volume mixed in, and that's the way we see the public reports coming out. And we've decided to stay true to providing only our fully electronic volume in Europe and elsewhere around the world. But when we look at it, we think that the electronic share in Eurobonds is probably around 45% of the total market. So there's plenty of room yet to grow. And I think when you look closely at the trends, and you include just the fully electronic volume, you'll see that we're not only gaining share on an absolute basis, we're gaining share from competitors.
Chris Concannon: I would just mention - there's a sizable opportunity in the Eurobond market in terms of electronic block trading. We continue to see, obviously, our record share average trade sizes are still small relative to the block market. But we are gaining block market share as well. So I think there's a huge opportunity in the Eurobond market to increase the electronic trading of blocks. Obviously, the dealers are quite comfortable of providing price for large-sized trades. And we think that opportunity is quite sizable in the Eurobond market.
Kyle Voigt: Thanks and if I could just squeeze in one more question. Now the call is running a little bit long here. But just in terms of the Mid-X protocol, I think it launched at the end of last year in the U.S. And there was some enthusiasm, I think, around what that uptake would be throughout this year given the kind of pure all-to-all nature of that protocol. I guess are you still seeing good levels or high levels of client interest around utilizing that in the U.S., and maybe just kind of an update on the uptake there.
Chris Concannon: Yes, I think, the way we approach the dealer-to-dealer business - and Mid-X is really a dealer-to-dealer offering. We have that offering live in Europe, and we continue to see demand for it. In the U.S., we're seeing higher demand for our dealer RFQ platform where dealers can come in and use Open Trading anonymously and request price from other dealers. And we continue to see growth in the dealer-to-dealer business, both globally in terms of Mid-X as well as the dealer-to-dealer RFQ business across U.S. and Eurobond market. So I think the offerings, that we are certainly growing is that dealer-to-dealer business. They look at things like live markets, RFQs as well as a mid-market session-based trading. In this environment with heightened volatility, those mid-market sessions are a little bit more difficult to manage because dealers are typically looking to move out of their inventory more rapidly than waiting around for a mid-market section. So we see heightened demand for dealer RFQ over any of those mid-market solutions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Rick McVey.
Richard McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q2, 2022 MarketAxess Holdings Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. Stephen Davidson. You may begin.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess second quarter, 2022 earnings conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the Company; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiatives; and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Let me now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. We continue to execute our growth strategy in the second quarter and delivered strong results across our key operating metrics. Importantly, we have increased our leadership position in the global credit institutional e-trading space versus our primary competitors with strong market share momentum in corporate bonds and emerging markets. We are now moving back into a much more favorable trading environment and the investments we have made to expand our foundation for growth are paying off. We achieved record levels of estimated market share across both credit and rates, driving a new quarterly record for global credit trading volume. Specifically, we delivered record quarterly market share in U.S. credit, high yield emerging markets, Euro bonds and U.S. Treasuries. We established a new record for global active clients and traders. The benefits of open trading, our differentiated liquidity pool are coming through with the highest level of transaction cost savings for clients since the pandemic environment in 2020. Beyond our core business and protocols, we are making excellent strides in new product areas. We achieved another record quarter with $23 billion in total portfolio trading volume. Municipal bond trading ADV was a record $371 million with a solid mix of tax exempt and taxable Muni activity and a record 342 active client firms. And U.S. Treasuries achieved record market share this quarter with 160 active clients trading. We also made several key announcements this quarter designed to enhance our data and ETF trading capabilities with the launch of an ETF on our market access investment grade 400 index. Our strategic collaboration with MSCI and our minority investment in virtue financials RFQ-hub for ETF share and equity derivative trading. In summary, strong growth in trading volume, broad based market share gains and increasing momentum in new product areas, including U.S. Treasuries and municipal bonds are driving significantly improved operating performance. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Just eight months ago, we predicted that an end to accommodative central bank policy and quantitative easing would drive a return to wider credit spreads and higher credit spread volatility. That is exactly what is happening today. And we are now in a much more favorable operating environment. The median bid/ask spread in high-grade has moved from two basis points to four basis points in a very short period of time. And this has been accompanied by unusually large price movements in the market, with high-grade and high yield bond indices down approximately 15% year-to-date. When liquidity is at a premium as it is today, more diverse sources of liquidity matter and the price improvement opportunity over open trading becomes a key differentiator in the market. We believe that this is a key contributor to our broad based market share gains across high grade, high yield, emerging markets, dollar corporates and Euro bonds, as reflected in our record composite corporate bond estimated market share of 20.2% which is up from a pre-pandemic share of 15.6% in Q1, 2020. One thing we did not anticipate was the rapid change in the slope of the yield curve, which has inverted in just nine months. Central bank tightening has led to a substantial increase in short maturity yields and a reduction in average maturity is traded, which has created a short term headwind for high-grade institutional fee capture. Over the last 30 years, the yield curve has only been inverted about 5% of the time. As a result, we expect the yield curve to return to normal when the Fed is comfortable, the inflation numbers are trending lower. Slide 5 illustrates our expanding global client network. The depth and diversity of the liquidity on our global platform is clearly shown by the addition of new active clients and traders globally. We set new records with 1,935 total active client firms, with record international active clients increasing to 982 on the platform, driven primarily by strong growth in Asia. Active investor and dealer traders also increased to new records with over 11,000 active traders on the platform, including a record 5,300 total active international traders. Our large and growing institutional client network is our biggest asset and provides the foundation for long term growth as we add more products and trading protocols to our global trading platform. Slide 6 illustrates how the improved macro backdrop and our diverse liquidity is delivering significant cost savings for our clients. Wider spreads have created an environment where the benefits of open trading are coming through in the form of a significant increase in transaction cost savings for our clients. Liquidity conditions and fixed income trading has become challenging once again, reminding all market participants of the importance of all-to-all trading liquidity. The increased activity over our platform is clearly shown in the record levels of total credit and open trading executed trades. In the quarter, we delivered $238 million in estimated cost savings via open trading, which equates to an annual run rate savings of approximately $1 billion well in excess of the total annual commission revenue we currently generate. The combination of transaction cost savings and significant improvements in trading and post trade efficiency creates a strong value proposition for our clients. We believe our substantial first mover advantage in all-to-all trading will continue to differentiate market access from our competitors for many years to come. Slide 7 illustrates the strong year-over-year increases in estimated market share. The share gains that we achieved in the second quarter exceed the long term average gains for the company. We believe this is the most compelling quarter we have ever had for meaningful and comprehensive market share gains across all products and regions and 92% of our volume is conducted with institutional investor clients. According to the major global banks we recently surveyed, the market access lead in institutional client electronic credit trading has widened in all three geographic regions. To give you some historical perspective, although one of our primary products were in the top quartile for year-over-year quarterly growth in estimated market share over the past 10 years and high-grade was in the second quartile. In the long term, market share gains are the strongest contributor to shareholder value in our DCF model. Slide 8 illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing. The strong market share gains we delivered this quarter only served to reinforce the sizable opportunity that we have before us in terms of top line growth potential. All else equal, one percentage point increase in market share across all our products generates approximately $50 million in incremental revenue annually. And the total revenue opportunity in front of us is substantial with an estimated $9 billion revenue opportunity in the fixed income e-trading sector by 2031 assuming historical market growth rates. If you add some expectation for higher trading velocity in the years ahead, as well as a growing data opportunity, the revenue opportunity is even larger. Importantly, with our financial model, we can capture this opportunity at very attractive returns with our current return on equity of approximately 25% in our current EBITDA margins north of 50%. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments in new initiatives.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Rick. Slide 10 provides an update on open trading and our protocol expansion. In the second quarter, over 38,000 orders and $21 billion in notional value was available daily through our open trading marketplace, an increase of 32% and 33% respectively. A record 1700 unique firms were active across our open trading network during the quarter, with approximately 1000 firms providing liquidity. This diversity of participation continues to drive significant cost savings for our clients as credit spreads widen with the total savings delivered through open trading year-to-date. Live markets rates are innovative all-to-all solution in U.S. Treasuries saw trading volume increase 57% year-over-year with a strong increase in market share as well. We continue to onboard clients and launch new rates products. Live markets for credit saw total trading volume increased to 3.5 billion in the first half of the year which is up 76% compared to the second half of 2021 with 171 clients active on the platform. Given the recent liquidity challenges in the rate space, we believe that our all-to-all model is increasingly being viewed as a potential solution for liquidity challenges across both the credit and rates markets. Municipal bonds also registered record ADV of $371 million. Excluding MuniBrokers, our organic Muni volume grew 84% year-over-year. We continue to build liquidity on the platform with another major municipal bond firm coming online and beginning to trade in the coming days. Slide 7 highlights the increasing momentum we are seeing with automation in credit trading. Automated trading on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to 57.6 billion in volume and over 305,000 trades reflecting very strong adoption despite the increase in volatility. Today Auto-X represents 19% of total trade count and 8% of our credit trading volume. We also are seeing an increase in auto responder trading volume and automated responses. Adoption in Europe has been particularly strong with Auto-X volume up 53% and trade count up 50%. Additionally, the use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform with approximately 5.7 million algo responses in the second quarter, up 23% from the same period last year. The impressive three year CAGR is shown on this slide reflect the strong long term growth we are experiencing across our trade automation suite. Slide 12 illustrates the powerful diversification of our model across products and protocols. The second quarter was a record for portfolio trading with total PT volume of 23 billion, which represents an increase of 64% from Q1. We delivered the strong performance with estimated portfolio trading market volumes in high-grade and high yield increasing only 9% sequentially resulting in very strong estimated market share growth in the second quarter. Estimated high-grade and high yield portfolio trading market volume represented approximately 6% of the total high-grade and high yield TRACE market in Q2 up slightly from the first quarter. Estimated high-grade and high yield portfolio trading market volumes have remained relatively flat as a percent of total trace over the last four quarters. In the first half of the year, we had a record 96 active clients and we executed a record 534 trades driving record portfolio trading volume of 37 billion. Through the first half of July we have already registered 67.6 billion in portfolio trading volume and are currently trending to a new monthly record. Slide 13 is an update on emerging markets where we continue to see strong growth in local markets and overall market share. We achieved 13% growth in ADV in emerging markets during the second quarter with record local markets trading volume driving record estimated market share. Local markets trading volume of 68 billion represented a record 39% of total EM volume. The strong performance in local markets was driven in part by strength in EM trading volume across our APAC region. We also continue to onboard new clients with a record of 1,370 active clients trading EM on the platform. Slide 14 outlines our data strategy. The three pillars of our data strategy are as follows. First, our goal is to create best in class front office trading and real time data solutions that leverage CP+ and our trade automation capabilities. Next, we are creating data solutions that enhance the portfolio of construction process like our recently announced collaboration with MSCI, which leverages our proprietary tradability data and liquidity scores. Last we want to continue to develop new trading protocols and tradable products for our active and systematic clients like our recently launched MarketAxess 400 liquid bond index. We are in the early stages of implementing this strategy and the announcements that we made this past quarter will be key catalysts for our success. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials.
Chris Gerosa: Thank you, Chris. On slide 16 we provided a summary of our quarterly financials. Second quarter revenue was $182 million up 3% from the prior year including the impact of lower U.S. hybrid fee capture and foreign currency fluctuations. Strong growth in trading volume and market share gains across credit and rates was partially offset by a 10% decrease in total credit fee capture and lower information services and post trade revenue. Information services revenue in the quarter were negatively impacted $600,000 from a strengthen U.S. dollar from a year ago, as well as lower data sales due to timing. Considering the new data contract pipeline in the second half of the year, we expect our full year 2022 information services revenue growth rate to hit our historical levels around 10% on a constant currency basis. Second quarter post trade revenue included the negative impact of approximately $1.1 million on the strengthening U.S. dollar compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusting for currency fluctuations, combined information services and post trade revenue would have increased approximately 3% from the second quarter 2021. EBITDA was 105 million and our EBITDA margin was 58%. The increase in other income was due to 5.5 million in foreign currency transaction gains which benefitted EPS by $0.11 per share in the quarter and a small gain from our investment in RFQ-hub. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we expect other income in the remaining quarters of 2022 to net out to zero due to estimated gains from our RFQ-hub and improved investment yields on our cash balances. The effective tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior year. Due to lower than expected excess tax benefits related to share based compensation we now expect the full year effective tax rate to be at the upper end of previously stated guidance range of 24% to 26%. On slide 17, we provided more detail on our commission revenue and our fees per million. Total commission revenue increased 5%. Our growth in other credit and rates commission revenue was driven by healthy increases in our trading volume and estimated market share, but was partially offset by lower average fee capture across high-grade and other credit. The lower high grade fee capture was driven by a combination of higher bond yields and lower years to maturity, which accounted for approximately 85% of the $31 year-over-year decline. The decrease in other credit fee capture was driven principally by product mix shift as a result of the increase in EM local markets trading volume, which has a lower average fee capture as these are rates focus markets. Higher distribution fees across hybrid and other credit helped offset the impact of lower average fee capture across credit. On slide 18, we provided you with our expense detail. Second quarter expenses increased 9% driven principally by investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Specifically employee compensation and benefits increased 5 million on increase in headcount. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2 million due to higher software development and acquired intangible amortization expense. Technology and communication expense increased $2 million on higher software subscriptions, market data and technology licensing fees. On slide 19, we provided an update on cash flow and capital management. As of June 30, our cash and investments were $325 million, and our trailing 12 month free cash flow was $274 million. During the second quarter, we paid out $26 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased approximately 179,000 shares for a total cost of $49 million. We have $100 million of capacity remaining on the existing repurchase program. Our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 based on the financial performance of the company. Now let me turn the call back to Rick.
Richard McVey: Thank you, Chris. In summary, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We hit on all cylinders this quarter across most operating metrics within our control. And we believe that high-grade fee capture is likely to move higher in the future as the yield curve returns to normal. The record level of market share gains we registered this quarter are a clear indicator that the investments we have made to expand our growth cylinders and increase our product diversification are paying off. Our strong execution, broad based market share gains, increasing momentum in new products and expansion of our global footprint are setting a very strong foundation for growth in periods ahead. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin our question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Richard Repetto with Piper Sandler.
Richard Repetto: Yes, good morning, Rick and Chris and Chris. I guess the first question is on the capture, Rick. And I know it caught everyone by surprise. But I guess when the yield curve steepens again, we're not in this invert. Like, is it like a spring loaded effect where there should be no impact to market, the nice market share gains you've made, like lower fees in any way, not in any way impacted market share, I guess is my point and would an increasing fee per million not impact market to have going forward?
Richard McVey: Well, I think the question is about return to normal curve and what that is likely to do for fee capture. There are two primary factors that go in. this is the nature of institutional client trading in high-grade corporate bonds only. There has been very little movement in our fee capture for other credit because those are price based products. But within high-grade corporate bond, institutional client trading, clients trade on a yield spread to treasuries and our transaction fee is also based on a yield spread which is why duration matters in determining that outcome for high-grade fee capture. So there are two key things that go into that. One is the overall level of yields and the other is the average maturity of bonds traded on the platform. Both of those worked against us in the year-over-year period, because of course, yields are much higher year-over-year, which drives down duration and the curve has inverted. So you had very unattractive yields in the short end of the curve one year ago, you have now have the most attractive yields at the short end of the curve because the yield curve inversion. So both of those have worked against us. So yes, if we get back to the normal shape of the yield curve, which we would expect to over the periods ahead, you should see that the average maturity is also returned to normal, which all else equal will help fee capture. The other question that is what our overall yield levels in that mix to drive the total fee capture. But as you've seen from long periods of time, we're at the lower end of what we've experienced historically in high-grade fee capture and that came off of a period when the curve was relatively steep, and we'd been at the higher end. So we think over time is all neutralizes and averages out. But unfortunately, in this particular period, we've had both drivers of fee capture pointing lower, even though we've had absolutely no changes in our fee model for high grade trading.
Chris Concannon: And Richard I would just add, as we see fee capture picking up as that yield curve adjusts, and our clients start trading across the curve, we don't see that increase in capture impacting our share growth either. Obviously, these fees have been in place for many years. And clients aren't sensitive to that type of fee change over time as the yield curve starts to change.
Richard Repetto: Understood. Thanks for answering my question. One follow-up, is it looks like your headcount decline quarter-over-quarter, and just trying to understand that and sort of the picture of the guidance for the OpEx going forward and continued investment. So the client headcount was sort of surprising. I guess any more color on that?
Chris Concannon: Yes Richard, it's really all about timing. When we look at our full year hiring plan, we expect to hit the full year budget by the end of the year. And as of today, we've got just over 50 heads identified as Q3 hires. So it's just a timing when you're looking at sequential headcount impact, but year-over-year we're up 7%. And we're going to, we strongly believe we're going to hit our hiring plan. It's just a matter of the timing and the back end of the year. And it's good question on the operating expenses because the storyline this quarter was definitely FX. It had an impact on our revenue, but it also had a benefit on our operating expense. Our operating expenses would have been just around 2.5 million higher if you adjust it on a constant currency basis. So the level of operating expenses $97.5 million in the second quarter. When you're thinking about the exit rate for Q3 and Q4 consistent with last quarter, it should be like a 3% to 4% growth rate on top of Q2 and of course, that's assuming that the currencies are constant.
Richard Repetto: Got it. Understood. It's very helpful. And I know Chris Concannon wants to build out his team further.
Chris Concannon: Yes, unlike the bank, so we recognize the investment opportunities. So we're not pulling back on our hiring plans. We're trying to accelerate that.
Richard Repetto: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse.
Gautam Sawant: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to know what technology and protocols the MarketAxess platform has that could increase primary market, corporate bond market share and that marketplace, we're seeing technology becoming increasingly embedded in the new issue processes. And I want to just have you expand on if there's an opportunity for MarketAxess to compete in that primary market the same way you've been able to grow in the secondary market?
Richard McVey: There are a variety of workflow solutions that are active in the primary process. It's not a space that we are currently in and our focus continues to be almost exclusively around secondary trading and growing out protocols and products and market share there. Having said that, live markets is focused on the most liquid and the corporate bonds, including newly issued bonds. So we do think we're providing a new solution with live anonymous trading at the liquid end, supported by a number of the leading banks to develop that protocol that we would expect would be very active over time and newly issued bonds. But the workflow solutions around the new issue process are not currently an investment area for the company.
Gautam Sawant: Got it. Thank you. And just as a follow-up question, can you share insights of the type of activity that you're seeing within the fixed income ETF market and how quantitative tightening is impacting the processes that market participants are taking? And does the growth of that fixed income ETF market, how will that affect the velocity of corporate bond trading and I guess the changes of investors holding to maturity versus like trading more?
Richard McVey: Yes. What we've seen in the past, there's been a real transformation of market making and risk transfer and fixed income in especially in credit over the last three or four years. So you see a variety of new tools at work from portfolio trading to ETF share trading, increased algorithmic trading, increased trading automation with clients, all of which were participating in actively. ETF shares had a very active quarter volume this quarter. Part of that was outflows in the sector. But a part of it is because the institutional market, both dealers and investors are using ETFs as another risk transfer tool. And my view is all of this is good for velocity, much of the way that S&P futures accelerated the growth and underlying stock trading I think where we're heading is a model where there are a variety of different tools. There is more automation, with both investors and dealers, and you'll see more active trading and more active velocity. And ETF share trading is a welcome addition to that equation because it's just another tool to help clients and dealers transfer risk.
Chris Concannon: And Rick, I would just add, as we see rates rise, and fixed income assets become more attractive, particularly for retail investors we would expect fund flows to be quite positive towards fixed income ETFs and rather than managed funds over time. Obviously ETFs provide a more efficient investment strategy given some of the expense ratios. So we would expect ETF flows in the fixed income arena to increase with the more attractive fixed income rate yields that we'll be seeing in the future.
Richard McVey: Yes. And finally, Chris, obviously, our investment in RFQ-hub, along with some of the leading market makers is a sign of our expectation to offer ETF share trading through the market access trading platform. So we're very pleased to have been able to complete that step in the second quarter with virtue and the other market makers and we will be working toward a strategy to bring those capabilities to our clients on market access.
Gautam Sawant: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, it's Michael on for Alex. So last couple of quarters, we kind of seen on the high yield side, the dealer shifting to distribution payment plans. I was wondering if you could help us kind of understand the potential net revenue impact of those moves and what's been the driver and how much more might still be in the pipeline? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Yes Mike. You're right, we've seen migration for. I mean two high yield dealers migrating to a fixed fee plan and those fixed fee plans are $150,000 a month. So it's 450 per quarter that you're seeing a pickup. And it's a good sign for us because it means that those dealers anticipate that they're going to do more on the platform. We're still charging a transaction fee for those fixed fee plans. But they're not, they are paying a lower transaction fee as compared to the monthly minimum commitment fee planning around previously. But as of today, we haven't identified any additional dealers. So the group of dealers that you're seeing hitting the credit fixed fee distribution is expected to remain the same for the foreseeable future.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies.
Daniel Fannon: Thanks, I wanted to talk about the market backdrop a bit more. Obviously, spreads have widened. You've continued to talk about automation. But I guess are you surprised that the overall trace volumes aren't higher, given the backdrop of what some of those factors have created? Or are presenting?
Richard McVey: Not terribly surprised. One of the factors, Dan is you saw and in all of the bank and major dealer, second quarter earnings, including [Euro] is that the new issue calendar is way much lower than it had been previously. And that clearly is an important catalyst for overall TRACE volumes. So that factor is certainly in the trace volume numbers that you see from the second quarter. And we've had a pretty big shock to the market with a 15% drop in prices. So the overall dollar value at work and corporates is lower than it was at the beginning of the year as well. So I'm not terribly surprised. As you know, we continue to believe that we see lots of reasons for optimism on velocity with the increase in market participation, including lots of new and interesting clients continuing to come online in credit trading, and the 40% compound growth rates we're seeing in trading automation with both dealers and investors and the new liquidity tools that we just talked about. So we are optimistic long term, but we're not surprised with some of the short term headwinds around overall market volumes.
Chris Concannon: And, Dan, I would just add, we're hearing from our clients about some of the liquidity challenges. And those liquidity challenges aren't just in treasuries, we're also seeing liquidity challenges in credit. So many times, given challenges around liquidity, it could impact overall volumes. But that's why our OT or open trading alternative liquidity solution did actually see some positive yield in the second quarter and gains across many of the different products in terms of overall volumes, but also penetration within those products.
Daniel Fannon: Understood, thank you. And then as a follow-up on the non transactional revenues. I heard the info services outlook of 10%. I want to make sure that's for the whole year or the second half of the year. And then within post trade I know there was some anticipated run off from some clients. Just want to understand the run rate for that portion of the business and thinking about growth maybe not either this year or prospectively how we should think about that. Thank you.
Chris Concannon: Sure. I'm happy to tackle both. So for info services obviously, we have a very strong pipeline and we saw a number of contracts slipped from Q2 into Q3. So it's really just a timing issue. And also, Q1 last year saw some one time revenue items as well that we didn't see this quarter. We feel very strong about info services and the product offerings that we have. We continue to see progress in our CP+ product, as well as our newly announced Axess All Prints which is part of the Axess All suite of products. We're confident about achieving those double digit annual growth rates. And that is an annual growth rate number that was referenced earlier. With regard to post trade we were obviously impacted by some of the year-over-year currency changes. But the post trade business also saw some expected attrition, as you mentioned, clients from the recent acquisition of Reg Reporting hub, as we migrated that platform. We had some targeted attrition. We were really pushing to transfer clients that were highly profitable. So we saw some expected attrition of clients on that business. That business also has a very strong pipeline of clients, obviously, much more subscription based business. So I suppose that pipeline builds we start to see revenue really show up in the prior quarters for those products. Some of the new products on post trade that we're excited about, we continue to see progress in our repo match service, seeing year-over-year gains and a number of key clients joining that matching service and then a new product called [sonar] which is part of our post trade offering for existing clients. It's a wonderful surveillance tool that allows clients to review their own activity. And that's a product that's newly launched and we would expect to see revenue showing up at the end of the year or early next year.
Daniel Fannon: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Maybe a related question to the prior question on industry volumes but more so regarding the idea that entire market velocity of trading will increase as electronification moves higher. I guess given that we've seen hybrid electronic trading moved from 20% to near 35% to 40% over the past several years. Are you surprised we really haven't seen turnover rates move higher over that time period? And what do you think the tipping point is that accelerates that velocity of trade?
Richard McVey: I think we're still in the midst of the transformation of the trading and risk transfer model and global credit. So not terribly surprised that we haven't seen the increase in velocity. But as I mentioned earlier, Kyle, I still see lots of reasons to be optimistic longer term.
Chris Concannon: And Rick I would just add, during that time period, we saw the overall fixed income market grow dramatically as a result of the massive new additions that we've seen over the last two years. So you have a very large growth in the overall fixed income. Asset class in the short term, impacted the turnover rate of that asset class. More importantly, if you think about electronic trading in fixed income, it's largely driven by RFQ, timed RFQs. So even though the electronic version is more efficient, and more trades can get done it doesn't have that dramatic impact on velocity as you would expect from pure electronic trading. I'd pay close attention to some of our products like automation, which really streamlines execution, and can actually increase velocity dramatically. And our automation numbers are up sizably grew 39% from last year, and we're seeing record volumes across both trades and overall volume, notional traded. So I would pay close attention to that automation suite of products because that really pushes the accelerant on velocity of trading.
Kyle Voigt: Great, thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up regarding revenue capture. Just wondering if you can provide the average years to maturity for high grade in the quarter. And remind us the historical range that you've seen for that high grade bucket?
Richard McVey: Yes, for the second quarter was just over nine for the years to maturity and it's been hovering around high eight, low nines for the last couple of quarters, it peaked out at 10 Kyle back in Q1 of '21. But going back longer term in 2019, it did hit the mid 7s. But we've seen stabilization so far in July of 2022.
Kyle Voigt: Understood, so it sounds like most of the movement, I guess sequentially in the key captured was mostly related to the yield curve shortening duration rather than a mix in the years to maturity.
Richard McVey: Yes that's right. I mean, if you're looking at sequentially, we actually had a $2 pickup on years to maturity, but we were hit with the bond yield movement.
Kyle Voigt: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Good morning, to follow-up on the last question there. On your prior quarterly earnings call, you guys had indicated that high-grade fee capture had stabilized in April relative to first quarter levels. And then obviously, it was down $12, quarter-over-quarter for the entirety of the second quarter. Does that imply that peak capture in May and June was then probably in the 130s? And if so, is that what we should be thinking as we enter the third quarter?
Richard McVey: Yes, Patrick, if we go back to last quarter, we're talking about stabilizing it was more in a context of the exit rate for Q1. When you go back to December, or the fourth quarter, our average fee capture was in the mid 160s. We averaged out 155 for the first quarter. So each quarter sequentially during that first quarter, we saw a decline in fee capture that brought us to that 150. And the same thing goes for April, May and June. But we're seeing more stabilization in the last three months relative to where we were in April. But the one item that's difficult to predict is years to maturity, as Rick mentioned, we've really taken a hit on bond yields. But it's difficult to predict how the trading behavior is going to push long or short, dated bonds on the platform?
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. And then sticking with the topic of fee per million, as you guys keep growing market share in emerging markets, is it your assumption that you will probably grow faster in local currency rather than hard currency? And if so, should we think about EM fee per million coming down over time?
Richard McVey: It's been the case here recently, which we're super excited about Patrick, because the global local market opportunity is larger in the aggregate than the hard currency opportunity. So this is a great sign of the evolution of our global EM franchise, which opens up a significant new revenue opportunity. And yes, longer term, we would expect EM local currency trading will outstrip hard currency trading. And we'll think more about it. But we're happy to provide some granular information there as we go. But all of this is new revenue through the growth in EM local trading, which, to us is really good news for shareholders, because we're starting to penetrate a very large and important part of the EM market.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Want to just circle back to portfolio trading. I think you mentioned it was coming in about 6% of industry trace levels overall. Seems to be holding up a bit better perhaps than feared in a tough market backdrop. So just would be curious to hear your thoughts around that. How do you see that volume value proposition evolving in a tougher market backdrop here? And then more broadly, when you look at your portfolio trading offering and others across the industry, just what sort of enhancements can be made to that offering across the industry that market access to drive more usage and uptick and PT broadly?
Chris Concannon: Well, I'll start and I'm sure Rick will have a few thoughts on portfolio trading. Obviously, we had a record quarter and we were able to execute 330 trades over that quarter and saw our market share of electronic PTs grow. We do think that while portfolio trading plays a role in transferring of risk in the marketplace. It's a very expensive trade to perform both in terms of time while managing the trade but also in terms of spread that is ultimately paid. So we've seen our clients look and perfect the right portfolios to trade with dealers and also we've seen dealers become much better at trading portfolios with their clients. The key I think to what we've seen, and again this is all estimated market share of trace, trying to retrace and understand what was a portfolio trade, we do see it has flattened out as a percent of overall trace volumes. So we're not seeing any growth even at times when it was less volatile than the second quarter. But despite the volatility, in the second quarter, we saw clients still make use of portfolio trading tools and also use our platform for portfolio trading. Key differentiators really what we're hearing from our clients are the need for analytics around portfolio trading, better data around the liquidity around individual names, estimated what the overall price of a portfolio trade would be, whether or not it would be preferred to trade it as a list instead of a full portfolio trade. So analytics that helped clients decide whether or not to put on a portfolio trade and also what parts of their overall list should be traded as a list or as a portfolio that's really, we're seeing a lot of demand for both real time pricing of the portfolio, but also analytics on how to perform the portfolio trade.
Richard McVey: Yes, I would just add, Michael, the path from zero to 5% share of trace was pretty steep. So a year ago there were a lot of expectations out that it was going to continue along that steep path. And as Chris mentioned earlier, it's been pretty flat for four quarters in a row and 5.5% or so of trace. So that's a change from where we were a year ago. And in our conversations with dealers and clients, it's much more difficult to manage the risk in a large portfolio trade today than it was eight or nine months ago. And that's reflected in the pricing that's coming through on portfolio trade. So the level of enthusiasm to promote portfolio trading is down in the dealer community. In my opinion, and it's reflected in pricing, it's not quite as tight as it might have been when we were in the very low volatility environment last fall, but in terms of enhancements there are lots of different client practices around PT and we're knocking out a lot of enhancements that are important to them every month, very focused on the things that they would like to see added. They're also super excited about what we've done to integrate CP+ in our analytics. So it makes them, it makes it easier for them to track pricing as they're working up a portfolio. And we're benefiting from the large credit trading footprint that we've had for many years around the world that trades bid and offer lists with us all day long. So all of those are working in our favor and pleased to say that our goals for this year around portfolio trading growth are very much on track.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thanks for that. And just a quick cleanup question on the capture rate. Can you just remind us what the impact would be to the high grade capture rate of interest rates? I guess it's the back end of the curve a 10 year treasury goes up by 100 basis points and how to think about the impact to capture if we see a one year move in years to maturity from here?
Richard McVey: Yes, Mike, where we are in a curve right now every 100 basis points is $4 to $5 and every one year to maturity is around 15.
Michael Cyprys: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. It seems we have a follow-up question from Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse.
Gautam Sawant: Hi, thank you for taking my follow up. Can you help us maybe contextualize how July market share is trending so far? And then if the type of trading activity you're seeing in the marketplace, if that's more fundamentally driven or if it's more due to the overall like pickup in credit spread volatility and it's the macroeconomic drivers?
Richard McVey: The share trends in July are very similar to what we saw broadly in Q2. The second half of July market volumes are almost always higher than the first half because of the trading days around the 4th of July holiday. So we have eight full days of trading that represent a significant part of monthly volume still in front of us. And on your other question, I don't think that there's anything I could say about the first two weeks of trading in terms of any significant differences in client patterns versus the second quarter results that we went through.
Gautam Sawant: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call over to our presenters for closing remarks.
Richard McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. Enjoy the rest of this summer and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on April 20, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Davidson: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the Company; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiatives; and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. In the first quarter, we continued to execute our long-term growth strategy and total revenue of $186 million was our second highest quarter ever. EBITDA for the quarter was $106 million and EBITDA margin was 57%. Trading volumes rebounded strongly as market conditions improved from prior quarters. Total average daily trading volume reached a record $38 billion. We achieved the second highest level of average daily volume in total credit and we delivered record U.S. Treasury, emerging markets and municipal bond average daily volume. Total active clients trading on the platform also reached a new all time record for the quarter. These strong business results are a clear sign that the investments we are making to expand our foundation for growth are paying off. Importantly, as spreads have widened, the benefits of our unique all-to-all liquidity came through with total Open Trading estimated transaction cost savings rebounding to over $200 million for the quarter. Average transaction cost savings per trade through Open Trading were up approximately 60% from recent quarters. In our unique Live Markets all-to-all order book, we are continuing to gain traction across both rates and credit with a new quarterly record ADV in U.S. Treasuries of $25 billion, up 38% year-over-year and record volumes and active clients in corporate bond Live Markets. Beyond our core business and protocols, we are making excellent strides in new product areas. We registered a record $14 billion in portfolio trading volume, emerging market, local market trading reached a new record of 22%, municipal bond trading ADV was a record $288 million, which benefited from the integration of MuniBrokers and we launched our MarketAxess 400 Index to create a highly tradeable corporate bond index as well as Axess All Prints, a real-time European fixed income trade tape. We believe our growing global product footprint, record numbers of institutional clients and improving market conditions create a strong foundation for long-term growth. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Credit spread and interest rate volatility have both increased over recent months driving record trading activity on the platform. The first quarter saw high levels of investment grade corporate bond issuance, which is likely to slow for the balance of the year. While we are only three weeks into the new quarter, estimated high-grade, high-yield and emerging market share are all tracking well above Q1 levels. Combined U.S. high-grade and high-yield estimated market share is currently above 20%, up from 19.1% in Q1. When combined with share trends in Eurobonds, munis and U.S. Treasuries, the breadth of our market share gains has never been better. Central Bank monetary policy has shifted dramatically with higher rates and the likely reduction of balance sheets to reduce inflationary pressures. We believe that higher bond yields and less Central Bank quantitative easing will support higher market volatility in the periods ahead. Higher bond market volatility is already driving increased demand for Open Trading liquidity in U.S. Treasuries and credit versus prior quarters. This is coming through in market share trends, active client firms and overall trading volumes. Slide 5 illustrates our expanding global client network. The increasing network effect on our platform is clearly illustrated by the addition of new clients globally. During the first quarter, we set new records with 1,913 active client firms globally with over 1,000 firms integrated from their order management systems. Our increased investment internationally is paying off with a new record 975 firms trading actively outside of the U.S. with notable traction in Asia. For the first quarter, a record 32% of our global credit trading volume came from clients outside the U.S. Additionally, the number of active institutional investor and dealer traders set a new record at approximately 11,200 traders. 92% of our trading volume continues to be with institutional investor clients and the remaining 8% represents dealer-to-dealer trading volume. In Europe, we now have nearly 1,000 client firms utilizing our post-trade regulatory reporting services up from 440 firms at the end of 2020. Slide 6 illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing. We have included this slide again this quarter because it reflects the enormous opportunity we have in front of us and the expanded foundation we have established to diversify our business. Our broader product footprint and growing menu of protocols create multiple options for growth. We are in very early stages of electronification in most of these markets and we estimate they conservatively represent a $9 billion revenue opportunity for our sector. We believe it is also likely that all-to-all trading and trading automation will lead to higher levels of overall bond trading velocity. We are excited about the many ways we are pursuing a larger data opportunity, the launch of our MarketAxess 400 Index and our real-time European fixed income trade tape are both examples of this investment. Finally, we continue to expand our post-trade business with additional clients and post-trade services. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments in new initiatives.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Rick. Slide 8 provides an update on Open Trading and protocol expansion. Open Trading provides our clients with one of the deepest and broadest pools of liquidity for bonds. Open Trading is a unique competitive advantage that we leverage across all of our products and protocols. In the first quarter, over 36,000 orders and $20 billion in notional value was available daily through our Open Trading marketplace, a record 1,710 client counterparties were active across our Open Trading network. This diversity of participation continues to drive cost savings for our clients as credit spreads widen. Clients saved an estimated $201 million in transaction costs during the quarter. Live Markets for credit had record trading volume in the first quarter with record trade count already surpassing full-year 2021 levels. And we now have 1,200 bonds actively quoted daily across high-grade and high-yield. Our Live Markets for treasuries reached record volume of $1.5 trillion during the quarter, an increase of 40% from last year and a record $2 million trades up 64%. We now have 20 of the 24 primary dealers’ active on our Live Markets Treasury platform. And our Mid-X sessions protocol increased 72% in Eurobonds and continues to build in U.S. high-grade and high-yield after launching in the fourth quarter. Slide 9 highlights the increasing momentum we are seeing with trade automation. Our trade automation tools powered by our Composite+ market data that delivering workflow efficiencies, reducing our client's cost of trading and further embedding us in client workflows, while delivering premium execution quality. With our trade automation tools, a large portion of our client's order flow can be executed through a low-touch or no-touch solution with the confidence that they are achieving best execution through a highly efficient trading technology. Trade automation on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to 49.3 billion in volume and over 280,000 trades, reflecting increasing client adoption and higher levels of client penetration. Today, trade automation represents 18% of total trade count on MarketAxess and 7% of our total volume. Trade automation has become a critical outsourced trading technology solution for some of our largest institutional clients. Additionally, the use of dealer algorithms partly supported by our powerful market data is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 5.3 million algo responses in the first quarter, up 12% from the same period last year. Slide 10 illustrates the powerful diversification of our model across products, protocols and revenue type. In the first quarter, we continued to see increasing contribution from our new protocols that I just touched on earlier as well as from portfolio trading and our Diversity Dealer Initiative. Trading volume from these new initiatives represented 12% of our total credit volumes in the first quarter. The month of March was particularly strong in terms of record client participation and record number of portfolio trades. Our global platform is now generating market data that enhances and enables many of our global trading protocols. Our unique market position allows us to create proprietary market data solutions such as our MarketAxess 400 Index, our CP+ total markets and our recently launched European fixed income trade tape All Prints. Our information services and post-trade business have become an important part of our franchise, generating combined record revenue this quarter of approximately $20 million. As a result of our increased diversification, our recurring revenue consisting of fixed distribution fees, information services and post-trade business hit a record $51 million, representing an increase of 9% year-over-year. Slide 11 is a deeper dive into emerging markets, which is one of our largest global opportunities. We achieved record revenue and ADV in emerging markets during the first quarter. The record quarter was highlighted by a record trading day on March 31 of over $8 billion, almost $1 billion above the previous single day trading record. As a reminder, emerging markets at MarketAxess is a combination of external debt trading in dollars, euros and yen and local markets trading across local currencies. We have close to 30 different marketplaces active on our trading system and these local markets are now roughly one third of our EM trading volume. We see a tremendous growth opportunity in many of these local markets and across LATAM, EMEA and Asia, because they are principally rates markets in very early stages of electronification. We are not only experiencing exceptional growth in EM trading volume, but we are also onboarding new clients with a record 1,348 active clients trading EM on the platform. Clients are increasingly embracing our solution in local markets for larger size trades, which is reflective of the increasing adoption of a request for a market protocol, where we saw an increase in trading volume of 48%. Block trades account for approximately 75% of local market volumes. So we think we are well positioned to capture this important segment of the market. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials.
Christopher Gerosa: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 13, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. First quarter revenue of $186 million was down 5%, but represented the second highest level of quarterly revenue. The 6% decline in commission revenue was mainly due to lower U.S. high grade fee capture, but was partially offset by higher distribution fees and record U.S. treasury and municipal bond commission revenue. The combination of higher distribution fees and record information and post-trade services revenue increased our recurring revenue in a quarter to a record $51 million. Total expenses increased 7%, driven principally by acquired intangible amortization expense and investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. As we continue to invest, we delivered our third highest level of EBITDA of $106 million and in EBITDA margin of 57%. The increase in other net was due to two special items. First, a $1.6 million gain related to the remeasurement of the contingent liability associated with one of our recent acquisitions and a $1.3 million foreign currency transaction gain, which when combined provided for net $0.06 per diluted share benefit in the quarter. For modeling purposes, we expect other net to be a drag of roughly $800,000 per quarter, absent special items like those that flow through this quarter. The effective tax rate was 28.4% in the first quarter compared to 21% in the prior year. The higher effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower excess tax benefits and the impact of a non-recurring $3.2 million tax charge, or $0.08 per diluted share related to a settlement with New York State tax authorities to resolve the 2010 to 2014 audit cycle. Collectively, the net impact of the tax charge and gains recognized in other net provide for a $0.02 per share negative impact on earnings. We are reconfirming our full-year 2022 effective tax guidance range of 24% to 26% excluding this tax charge. We expect the remaining quarters of 2022 to be around the midpoint of the guidance range. On Slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fees per million. Total variable transaction revenue is down 9%, driven principally by lower fee capture, partially offset by higher U.S. Treasury, municipal bonds, Eurobonds and EM transaction revenue. The lower high-grade fee capture was driven by a larger percentage of shorter duration high-grade bonds traded on the platform, which represented approximately $22 of the $25 year-over-year decline. We have not changed our high-grade fee plan, and we have seen similar volatility in year-over-year high-grade fee capture in the past, such as the third quarter of 2020 when longer duration drove high-grade fees per million, up $26 to $200 per million for the quarter. Based on our high-grade fee model and all else being equal, we expect less variability in our fee capture even if rates continue to rise from these current levels. As we enter the second quarter, we are seeing U.S. high-grade fee capture stabilize around the first quarter 2022 levels. Other credit commissions decreased 4% mainly driven by decline in average fees per million, which decreased 7%. The decrease in other credit fee capture was driven by two dealers migrating through a high-yield distribution fee plan and a mix shift in product trading volume. The increase in EM local markets trading volume had the effect of reducing fee capture as EM local market bonds command lower average fees per million given these are rates focused markets. On Slide 15, we provide you with our expense detail. First quarter expenses increased $6 million or 7%, driven by higher acquired intangible amortization expense and investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. If we exclude the impact of acquired intangible amortization expense, expenses would have increased 5%. Compensation and benefits are more or less flat to prior year as we reported higher levels of variable compensation expense during the first quarter of 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.4 million due to higher software development and acquired intangible amortization expense. Our technology and communications expense increased $2.2 million on higher software subscription, market data and technology licensing fees. On Slide 16, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of March 31, our cash and investments were $400 million and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $278 million. During the first quarter, we paid out $26 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders, repurchased approximately 102,000 shares for a total cost of $39 million and paid out year-end bonuses and related taxes of approximately $45 million. We believe the current stock price level provides an opportunity to utilize excess cash to repurchase shares at a discount for their long-term value, and based on our financial results, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share. Now let me turn the call back to Rick.
Richard McVey: Thank you, Chris. In summary, we continue to execute well against our long-term growth strategy. The record volumes we registered this quarter are a clear sign that the investments we have made to expand our gross cylinders and increase our product diversification are paying off. New and innovative protocols that we have built are modernizing fixed income market structure and gaining momentum. Our strong execution combined with the improving market conditions and global fixed income set the stage for a promising period of growth ahead. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Richard Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Rick and Chris and Chris. So you definitely came through with the excitement, I guess on the improved market conditions. And I'm just looking – what you've experienced in April, you said it’s better remarkably improved or - and better than the – I thought you said the first quarter average. Can you give us a little bit more detail and color because if you look at just the first quarter average, it’s pretty close to March and given your sort of your excitement about it? Could you sort of give us a hint about a better idea of the increase in market share you’ve experienced – are experiencing to date?
Richard McVey: Sure. And I certainly gave a piece of that Rich in the prepared remarks, looking at combined high-grade and high-yield estimated share for April month to date at over 20% compared to the first quarter average of 19.1%. But in addition to that, the reason that we're excited is when we look across our new and expanded product suite, we're seeing those share gains come through also in emerging markets, Eurobonds, treasuries, and municipal bonds. So the momentum that we're seeing in share, combined with the market condition improvement, is what gets us more excited about growth in the periods ahead.
Richard Repetto: Got it. And I guess just the follow-up – sort of two follow-ups. You are now pointing more towards overall credit markets here, the combined. And is there a reason for that? Or as I think we've looked at it as two separate buckets as you compete in each, but is there a reason to sort of look at it on a combined basis and just…
Richard McVey: They're both part of the corporate bond market in the U.S. So given that we're just three weeks into the new quarter, we thought we would just give you a combined market share. And obviously in a week-and-a-half, we'll have all the details out on both high-grade and high-yield. But high-grade is clearly the more important piece given the size of that market relative to high-yield. So I think you can interpret that – the share trends are positive in both.
Richard Repetto: Got it. And just one detailed question. Is there any difference between the fee rates for the local markets in hard currency credit trading, the EM trading?
Christopher Gerosa: Yes. Each market – this is Chris Gerosa. Each market has a different rate. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the EM local markets are more of a rate focused product offerings. So you'll see those fee capture rates trend below $100 per million, which is one of the reasons why you set a duration in the fee capture quarter-to-quarter.
Richard Repetto: Got it. Very helpful.
Richard McVey: We actually published on our website the standard fee plan. So if you wanted to get a flavor of each individual category, I would refer you to the website of MarketAxess.
Richard Repetto: Got it.
Richard McVey: I think the important takeaway from Q1, Rich, is the point that Chris made earlier that we have made no changes to our fee plans. So in high-grade, you had the combined change of higher rates overall and a flatter yield curve. And that not surprisingly causes reduced duration when duration goes down, high-grade fee capture goes down because institutional investors trade on corporate bond spreads to treasuries and our fee model is on yield, not price. So that is the sole reason that the fee capture dropped in Q1, probably larger than prior some other prior periods because of the extent of the rate increase and the very rapid flattening of the yield curve. But as Chris mentioned earlier, as we look forward, we don't see the same level of volatility in high-grade fee capture and none of this has come from any changes whatsoever in our fee models.
Richard Repetto: And I just got to ask one quick follow-up on that. Why do you think that there wouldn't – suppose we had rate changes going forward, I just assuming that the yield curve doesn't move as much or farther out duration - interest rates don't move as much when you got the Fed expected to raise eight fee hikes this year?
Richard McVey: The sensitivity on duration is highest when rates are the lowest, which of course they were through the second half of last year. So we've already gone through the most sensitive change in duration with the current interest rate increase that's gone through. And as you know, the curve has completely flattened. So those two things have already occurred, which would suggest to us that we're not likely to see the same level of duration change in the periods ahead.
Richard Repetto: Understood. Thank you very much, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe – first question maybe just to talk about portfolio trading, that's obviously still a sizable debate in the marketplace. Just if you can refresh us on your ambitions for your portfolio trading market share within the industry and your view of where you think portfolio trading could comprise as a percentage of the total market and maybe just talk about that versus list trading in terms of the cost savings, I think are still – if I'm right, the cost savings can still be better on list trading in a more volatile backdrop? Maybe if you can just touch on that?
Richard McVey: Sure. Happy to Brian. And first of all in terms of the market environment around portfolio trading, a year-ago portfolio trading volumes and share were growing on a fairly steep curve. If you look at the TRACE tape and what appears to be portfolio trading activity within TRACE, it is stabilized at about 5% secondary market share of TRACE for high-grade and high-yield combined over the last 10 months or so. So it's kind of settled in at about 5% of the market, not showing the same levels of growth. Currently, I personally think in conversation with our dealer clients, that one of the key reasons for that is with both rates and credit spread volatility up significantly, it's much harder for the dealers to manage the risk in portfolios than it was during much of last year when volatility was very low. So you are seeing the market level stabilized. As we mentioned, we had a record quarter in PT. We continue to print with more clients. We printed with all the dealers that we believe are active in portfolio trading, and we continue to strive to be number one in portfolio trading as we are in other protocols in credit trading overall. So it's an investment area for us. It's moving in the right direction, still represents a relatively small part of secondary trading. And I think if volatility remains high, that's likely to remain the case.
Brian Bedell: Okay. That's good color. And then just on the recurring revenue, you haven't talked about that as much, obviously given the strong growth in the volume part of the business, but if we look at that growth year-over-year, it looks to me if I have my calculations right here, based on the numbers you are quoting, it's about 9% on a year-over-year basis. So maybe just a thought of – or do you have thoughts on where you think that can grow over a two to three-year basis given your - the recently announced product innovation on the market data side with the 400 and the euro fixed income tape?
Richard McVey: So on our recurring revenue, we obviously have three buckets there. Our dealer distribution fees, our post-trade business, which has grown over the last year, and then obviously our data business, which we're pretty excited about particularly given some of the new products that we've launched, CP+ and Axess All continues to be the driver of growth within the data piece of the business. But we do have some very attractive exciting new products like our European prints, which is a trade tape for Europe, as well as our CP total markets, which is just CP+ with very broad coverage across a broader set of bonds globally. And then within CP+, we have a number of products at the product level. So you obviously have the opportunity to launch CP+ for treasuries. We obviously have a growing CP+ for emerging markets, which is obviously a market that needs more transparency and is under great demand from our clients. So we continue to see our opportunity in the information services space grow over time. As we add market share, we're actually adding more data to our offering, so those records that you're hearing about in the first quarter across our volume and across our products is growing our data opportunity as well.
Brian Bedell: So you think there could be a compounding effect on that info services and post-trade services growth, as you grow volume to the extent where you could even potentially grow that revenue stream faster than and obviously volumes are dependent and volumes, but versus your transaction business?
Richard McVey: It does compound because as clients add more products or add more differential products, they're adding to their overall spend on the platform. But we're careful about how fast we grow it because obviously we want to see more growth and volume and more dealer participation. So we're being very cautious on how we grow that. And just a reminder, there's certain data products that will not be for sale for end users. They won't be embedded in our automation solution. So products around how to trade a bond, when to trade a bond, who to trade a bond with, those are important products that will drive, uniquely drive our trading automation tools and will only be for sale through those tools. So there is some exclusive data that we will keep proprietary and not make available for sale.
Brian Bedell: That's great. Thanks so much for the color.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. I think there was an updated rollout of your treasury open trading capabilities, or at least the integration of that offering towards the end of the quarter. Just wondering if you could talk about that a bit and the level of demand you're seeing from clients for an open trading solution in cash treasuries?
Christopher Gerosa: Yes. Great question, Kyle. Obviously, we had a record in the first quarter of $1.6 trillion, up 37%. Ironically the role out there you're referring to came at the end of the quarter. So we recently integrated our Live Markets for rates with clients OMS integration. It was a key integration. So prior to that clients didn't have an easy way to move their orders from their OMS into that solution. That's now fully integrated at the end of the quarter. We've also introduced in our RFQ platform, an open trading solution for treasuries. So those two integrations are what clients have been asking for as we've been pitching them on our treasury solution. I think they're both important because one is, it's a combined offering of streaming prices, a true click to trade solution, fully integrated with their OMS, and then a RFQ solution, both disclosed and an open trading solution that – right now doesn't exist in the treasury market. Ironically, even though most people think the treasury market is further advanced from electronification.  The introduction of open trading is something that the Fed has called for in their research of the treasury market. And obviously a number of regulators are quite focused on our introduction of the open trading solution which is now fully integrated and fully introduced as of this month. So we're getting great deal of excitement, certainly from some of the larger clients. From my vantage point, it's the first time a client – a large institutional client can leave a resting order in an all-to-all market in treasuries, ironically, something that didn't exist prior to this introduction. So we're pretty excited about the opportunity in treasuries and really excited about the feedback we're getting from clients as we roll out the platform to individual clients.
Kyle Voigt: Very helpful. Thanks for that, Chris. And then a follow-up on the high grade fee capture. Can you just provide some details on where the average years to maturity of the high grade bonds trade on the platform was in the first quarter and also provide some historical context on where that range has been historically and where it's gone down to on the low end in a flatter yield curve in environment historically?
Christopher Gerosa: Yes. Kyle, so in the first quarter of 2022, the years to maturity was just under nine years about 8.9. And if you look back over the course of the last five years, it's gotten as low as 7.5 years back in 2018 and 2019. And at that point in time, that's when you saw the last cycle there being a flat yield curve. And the fee capture was trading throughout 2018 at a range from $154 to $157 relatively stable range. And that's more or less where we are today. And if you look back in time when the yield curve started to steepen again, you saw years of maturity extend, which extended the duration and you saw the high grade fee capture pickup accordingly.
Kyle Voigt: Right, which is essentially, what's happening bit right now. But I guess if we see a continued flattening, I'm just wondering if there is a shift incrementally from what we saw in the first quarter towards the shorter years to maturity. Is there still that same level of sensitivity that you've given historically, which I think is something like in the range of $10 or $15 per million for every one year change and that year's to maturity or is that sensitivity now also lower?
Christopher Gerosa: Yes. Now the sensitivity on years to maturity is more in the mid-teens for every one year movement. But what – as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we're seeing in April, is an extension of duration and which has been driven by a longer duration that we're seeing on a platform.
Kyle Voigt: Understood. Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Sean Horgan with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.
Sean Horgan: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to see if you could provide an update on open tradings competitive advantage in the current environment. Given volatility trends, I think the first quarter market share trends took some by surprise. So just trying to parse out what's competitive dynamics versus other factors?
Richard McVey: Yes. Happy to take that and Chris might have some things to add as well. But yes, a lot of flows in and out that impact market share. And certainly March was an enormous new issue month in high grade that all else equal may have very well massed some of the underlying positive trends in our high grade market share that seemed to be reversing here in April, but there is economic logic when volatility and price dispersion grow. The cost savings that we deliver to clients also grow. And if you look at Q3 and Q4, where we had very little credit spread volatility, our quarterly transaction cost savings from open trading delivered to clients, we're around $125 million or $130 million per quarter.  If you look at Q1, it jumped to $200 million. So clients see that trade-by-trade. They're seeing the price improvement that we're delivering in. We are optimistic as it has in the past most notably in 2020, that it does change behavior. And it's an advantage that we have that is not shared elsewhere in the marketplace because of the almost 10-year investment we have in all-to-all trading in credit that's now carrying us into rates. So the price improvement is there and certainly early days in the second quarter, the market share trends are coming back our way as well. And I also think that as dealers have a more difficult time pricing portfolios, portfolio trades given the level of volatility, there's – at the margin, there's a shift back to open trading bid and offer lists, where the whole market is able to compete for that order flow and provide transaction cost savings in a market environment like we are in now.
Christopher Gerosa: And Rick, I'll just add. The open trading market share did increase across our product. So we are seeing it grow as a percent of overall market. In high yield, it obviously went up to 49% from 48% from the prior year, muni saw the largest jump to 48.6% of our volume is done in open trading. And even Eurobonds had growth, EM is where you just have to parse through the numbers. Our EM local markets do not include an open trading offering currently. So that growth in local markets does skew our overall EM open trading. But excluding our local market volume, open trading grew in emerging markets as well. So we are seeing that open trading value re-service in the market. The other area where, we talked – Rick talked about $200 million savings in open trading cost savings in Q1 where we're seeing even larger savings. We're seeing clients come into open trading and responding to other clients RFQ. So for the first time they are using either auto responder or manually responding to other RFQs. And we're seeing that behavior that introduces sizable savings beyond just the cost savings of open trading alternative liquidity providers. And that behavior is something that we're working closely with clients to increase. In high yield alone, we saw client savings reach close to $600 per trade by just responding to other clients RFQ. So those are sizable savings that clients can achieve. And it's really a way for clients to use limit orders as opposed to crossing the market through a traditional RFQ. So those savings are there. They're obviously been growing in Q1 and we're seeing those same levels in April as well.
Sean Horgan: Great. Thanks for all that color. And my next one, just on new issuance, we saw a pickup in March. So I'm just curious, are you seeing that sort of follow through benefits in market share already in April? Or would you expect that to be may be a further tailwind for the balance of the second quarter?
Richard McVey: Well, all else equal it's likely to benefit our share because of the patterns and practices on trading newly issued bonds in the first week. So March was an outlier in terms of the size of new issuance, especially in high grade. April has tapered off, it looks more like a normal April, as we see things currently, but the broadly held view is that corporates were frontloading more of their issuance this year because of their expectation that rates were likely to rise throughout the balance of the year. So I do think that the expectation is that the overall levels of new issue activity will be lower in the remaining quarters of this year.
Sean Horgan: Got it. Thanks for the answers and congrats on the results.
Richard McVey: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gautam Sawant: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Can you please expand on MuniBrokers progress? Why the first move advantage in the muni market is important and how the platform is currently positioned relative to competitors pursuing the same opportunity?
Richard McVey: Sure. Happy to help there. Obviously, I continue to be excited about our munis opportunity. Again, we had record volume in the first quarter $7.7 billion. So we continue to see clients coming to us and using us as a solution. The other interesting fact is we only had 275 active clients as of March, which is obviously up from just February. And that's a small portion of our overall almost 2,000 clients globally. So we do see a growth opportunity just in terms of client penetration and adding clients to our muni network. Open trading continues to be a viable tool for the muni market both in terms of some of the alternative liquidity providers that provide price in that market, but also allowing clients to participate directly in the muni market. Our exempt muni business grew to $1.5 billion, which is up 84% from Q1 2021. So we're seeing growth both in the taxable side as well as the tax-exempt side, and we're seeing growth out of our dealer RFQ offering, which leverages open trading as well, we are close to 80% since Q1 2021. The acquisition certainly adds close to 4% market share to our overall munis footprint. We see that both in terms of trading opportunities, but also in terms of the data opportunity that munis present. There is really not a great real-time muni feed in that market. And we see an opportunity to introduce better pricing, better transparency across the muni market. And we're slowly integrating the MuniBrokers platform onto our open trading network as well to further integrate that acquisition, but pretty happy with munis generally and thus far early days with the MuniBrokers acquisition, but pretty happy with the overall footprint of what we touch in the munis market.
Gautam Sawant: Got it. Thank you. And MarketAxess currently has about a $1 billion of the $30 billion TAM in EM local currency. What is the level of electronification in EM local specifically? And I guess, can you expand on some of the capabilities that the platform has that that's kind of driving the growth there and the competitive advantage?
Richard McVey: Yes. I'm happy to start. The EM local markets are at the earliest stages of electronification. And I think the – what we've successfully built is a global network of clients and dealers to build a unique workflow and liquidity solution in EM local markets. And it's driven today primarily by global investors, but our success in the regions that were mentioned in the prepared remarks is reflecting more adoption by local market participants within country. And that's where the big opportunity still exists. So we're in low-single digit. We think of the market opportunity in EM local and to have 30 markets available in one place with the workflow solution that we do is we think is a huge advantage to both dealers and investors active in those markets. So it's another example of where we think there is a tremendous amount of runway ahead in a market that we've been investing in for quite some time.
Christopher Gerosa: And I'll just add, the EM local market is a heavily brokered market really to achieve anonymity. And we're obviously exploring, expanding our open trading solution across local markets. We see an opportunity to provide anonymity into that market and further electronify, as Rick mentioned, it's a phone-based market somewhat chat based as well, but really electronification of that market is early days. And we see an exciting opportunity for open trading to introduce the anonymity that's really achieved through the phone and the brokers today. So exciting large market and a great opportunity for us.
Gautam Sawant: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hi, good morning. To what extent do you think your traction with newer trading protocols like portfolio trading, Live Markets and Mid-X are incremental volume for MarketAxess versus cannibalizing RFQ volume?
Richard McVey: I think there's a growing menu of suite and suite of solutions available to clients here than there has been in the past. But we're super excited about Live Markets obviously much further along already in treasuries, but I think order books have a real role to play in the future liquidity structure of fixed income. And we are certainly in a great place to be the leader and provider of Live Markets. And it's really interesting to see that a year ago, we only had one dedicated market maker in corporate bond Live Markets. We're at five now, we expect two or three more during this quarter. So you're seeing dealers get excited by order books being really an important source of not only making markets for them, but also finding their own liquidity. And if we can build that base in the most liquid end of the corporate bond market, it will have positive implications for the entire – rest of the less liquid corporate bond market. And it's directly tied into what we're trying to do with the MarketAxess 400 Index is those most liquid bonds that we now have available in our order book are also part of that index.  So I see Live Markets as really a catalyst for greater velocity in the periods ahead. It's tough to say with portfolio trading. I think that some of it, it is potentially an alternative way for clients to transfer risk. And part of it is probably new opportunities that have been made available. But Live Markets is where I would say, Patrick, we have the biggest opportunity to make a real difference in both credit and rates in terms of offering a new and live liquidity solution. 
Christopher Gerosa: And Patrick, I'll just add. What we've heard from clients particularly the hedge fund clients, the opportunity to place orders on a live order book and not just request price or respond to RFQs in a more automated way using things like our automation tools. Those are exciting clients to actually trade credit like they've never traded before. They're seeing trade opportunities that didn't exist before. So I really think there's a higher velocity embedded in these new trading protocols that we're delivering, whether it's automation or Live Markets, it is giving a certain subset of the client population trading strategies that they just haven't deployed in the credit market before. So higher opportunity, lower costs of trading that introduces trades that they otherwise wouldn't make in the past.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: That's helpful. Thank you. And then your presentation today speaks to dealer renewals at higher fee levels with regards to your distribution fees. Are you guys starting to take pricing with your distribution fees?
Richard McVey: Say that again, Patrick, I'm not sure. I followed that.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: One of the slides that Chris spoke to have some commentary, it was Slide 14, increase in distribution fees due to higher unused monthly minimum commitment fees and dealer renewals at higher fee levels. So I'm curious that the dealer renewals at higher fee levels commentary suggest that you guys are exhibiting a little bit of pricing power with your distribution fees?
Christopher Gerosa: Yes. There was – we made no changes to the fees, but there were certain dealers that were online. And to your point, I guess we do have some pricing advantages with the attraction of trading on the distribution fee plan is a scale of them doing more business. So that pickup – we wanted to make the point that that increase in distribution fees didn't have anything to really do with the migration because that wasn't impacting, our fee capture is all about the ratio, but we're getting people to more standardized levels as we move forward.
Richard McVey: And we've used the distribution fee with dealers for a number of years, and it's very attractive to certain dealers given their overall volumes. And as we attract more clients onto the platform, which is obviously happening with our record active client numbers, more dealers will opt into those standardized distribution fees to participate in that client flow. So it's really reflective of the growth of the overall client base that we're adding that just that dealers are opting into more attractive dealer fee.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Daniel Fannon: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up again on our market share. And I think Rick in your prepared comments you said the breadth of market share gains has never been better. And so I was hoping within high grade, you could talk about what gives you confidence on, I guess, sustainability of either market share gains and obviously the macro has changed, but we've seen some of that shift earlier in the year and market share didn't come with it. So maybe what's different about April and maybe as you think about going forward that, again gives you confidence around additional share gains?
Richard McVey: Yes. You know what gives me confidence is 20 years of history Dan, is that, we've gained a lot of share over that time. And we had an outsized market share gain year in 2020 and a little flatter year in 2021 when we had no volatility in our markets, but volatility is back. And that's where the liquidity advantage that we've worked so hard to create versus our competitors comes in more strongly with our clients. And it does drive their behavior. So in April, we're starting to see spread levels move out. I think as people contemplate a higher probability of recession risk down the road, you're going to see more volatility in spreads. I think you're clearly going to see sustained volatility in rates and when that price dispersion grows, every period in history, the open trading transaction fee advantages that we have drive our market share higher.  And I'm just looking at this grid saying, I've never seen seven product areas moving higher in share at one time, the way that we're seeing it right now. So it's beyond just our core business and we're seeing it in treasuries and munis coming through very clearly as well. So a lot of work to create this broader footprint, but it does increase our addressable market. And we've got a long history of growing market share. We don't think that there's any interruption in that long-term story and the early results as we start Q2 are gratifying. And in terms of seeing that the open trading price differential is really coming through for our clients and they're trading a larger percentage of their business here.
Daniel Fannon: Understood. Thank you.
Chris Concannon: And the final thing is, it's really hard to build and many people have tried before unsuccessfully, but I do think that the work that we're putting in and the success that we're seeing in order books is a big deal. I really think this could be a very attractive way to trade both treasuries and the liquid end of the credit market and slowly, but surely we're seeing client adoption get to a really interesting place around the Live Markets order books, which obviously could be another catalyst for share gains.
Christopher Gerosa: And Dan, I'll just add. If you look at the records that we're setting across, not just our products, but also automation which is largely driven by high grade and high yield activity, but a record of 49 billion in the first quarter, which is up 36% from a year ago. It's now just in high grade alone our automation is 25% of trades is done through automation on the platform. That's very sticky business, and we're not even fully penetrated across the client base that is using it. We don't have all the largest clients set up for automation. So I see that opportunity is growing here dramatically over time.  Auto-Responder hit a record this quarter as well, and it’s still lightly used by most of our largest clients. And that's an opportunity to save sizeable dollars using open trading through automation. So just when you look at the full automation of the bond market in the future, we're still in early innings of what really has to happen when you look at, if you compare the bond market to other asset classes and how automated their trading activity is across the same client base that we're working with. We have a long way to go and really it will leverage not only our automation tools, but the liquidity that we deliver through a growing open trading solution across high grade, high yield munis, treasuries, all of the products that we offer here, automation cuts across every one of those products and continues to grow and continues to be in high demand from our largest clients. 
Daniel Fannon: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just following up, Chris, on your point there on trading automation. I think you had mentioned around 25-ish percent of actual trades with 7% or so of volumes a little bit lower on the volume side. I guess if this is successful over time, where do you see that getting to in terms of the share of volume and the overall share of tickets? And maybe you could talk a little bit about the profile of the customers that have more fully engaged or adopted these automated protocols and how are you looking to expand that usage with the other clients? Is this more coming from the dealers or how are you seeing that in terms of dealer uptake versus institutional clients?
Christopher Gerosa: Great question. It's really in high demand from our largest institutional client. So I think very large money managers around the planet that have lots of trade tickets and they'd like to do that fully electronically, fully automated either in what we call low touch fashion or a no touch fashion, no touch just means they deliver it through an API to a set of pre-instructed commands for the automation to execute. What's interesting about our automation right now, it's primarily an auto-RFQ solution. So we're really just mirroring the activity of either a manual electronic RFQ or a phone-based RFQ, where automation really starts to deliver sizeable savings is through things like Auto-Responder behaviors or trading at mid or automation that leverages our Live Markets or above. Those are all things that we have in our plans over time and that's really exciting for what we can do with automation because of the savings it delivers. Not only is it a savings for clients to kind of reduce their cost of trading and simplify their trade desk, but it's also a savings and execution quality. In some of our large clients that rely on automation tools. We see close to 50% of their activity coming through automation, so those are sizable reductions in workflow for those clients. And those are the clients that are most focused on automating their trading and their trading tickets in the bond market. And so we do see an opportunity amongst some of the dealers that are not auto quoting that could rely on some of our auto quoting solutions, but right now the primary client of automation here at MarketAxess is some of the largest money managers on the planet.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open
Christopher Allen: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Rick, I wanted to ask you just – you noted obviously volatility has improved and credit spreads are widening. We've seen ETF activity and credit accelerating materially this past quarter. I think many would've expected industry activity to be even better than it has been. So I'm wondering if you have any thoughts just in terms of maybe what's holding industry activity back is some of the large market participants sitting on cash right now. Any thoughts on that would be helpful.
Richard McVey: Yes. I think ETFs are an important part of the new liquidity model in fixed income overall. And I view it as similar to the connection between S&P futures and underlying stock trading, they're complementary to each other and ultimately lead to growth and in both sets over time. And I think that's the way the story will play out with the growth in ETF activity as well. The fund flows were fairly benign during the first quarter. So I don't think you had a catalyst for money managers to transact created by fund flows. And you did see modest declines in year-over-year activity around 5% or so in high grade or high yield. But I continue to be excited by what we see as the new risk transfer tools that are available in the market. The growth in all-to-all trading and the grid growth in automation that Chris has been talking about and to me that all leads to the prospects of higher velocity in the years ahead, very long-term trends and didn't come through as clearly as you might have expected in the first quarter. But I still believe that's the direction of travel with the new liquidity model that is developing for fixed income 
Christopher Allen: And on the velocity, I think you guys are probably able to measure it much more dynamically than we are, but when we kind of look at it, it's been actually declining. I'm just wondering, like how have you guys perceived velocity trends in recent periods, have you seen the impact of automation on your platform and continue electronification in terms of you taking share or other electronic platforms taking the share? Has there been any improvement in velocity from how you guys have seen it in recent years?
Richard McVey: Well, if you look at the two or three years prior to 2021, yes. And then you had an unusually benign market environment for both rates and credits, credit almost all of last year. So you did see a modest decline in velocity last year. The big change Chris happened actually on the back of bank regulatory reform in 2012 and 2013. And for obvious reasons, bank turnover went way down. And I think what you're seeing now is the establishment of a brand new fixed income trading infrastructure that dealers are embracing and clients are embracing as well to create new ways to transfer risk that don't require as much balance sheet. And we think where we certainly feel like we're at the center of that with the automation and the all-to-all trading protocols that we're developing consistently and the market is embracing. And that's what leads to my optimism that we will see higher velocity in the periods ahead. Let's not forget too that all-to-all trading has brought a lot of new participants into the credit markets and there are more coming. We are talking to lots of hedge funds in particular that are building up systematic credit trading strategies. And I do think it's because of the ability to participate in all-to-all markets. So we saw that already on the market making side with some significant new participants competing for order flow on the dealer side. And I think there's more to come on the hedge fund and investor side as well. So all that feeds into my view that you will see a long-term improvement in trading velocity.
Christopher Allen: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alexander Blostein: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in with a question here. I wanted to zone in a little bit on the high yield markets and the dynamics there, and it obviously feels like the environment broadly has improved. You mentioned that a number of times on the call today and you published, I guess a couple of things talking about March being a pretty robust volatility quarter for credit markets. I guess taking a step back, it just feels like MarketAxess participation in that higher volatility environment has been more muted recently in high yield than we've seen in the past. I was wondering why you think that is. And if that's just too short-term and it's just been a couple of months and you expect generally to see much more uplift?
Richard McVey: It's the latter, Alex. We're confident in our high yield solution. We know from recent history in 2020 that when high yield volatility picks up and people start to get more concerned about default risk in high yield, that all-to-all liquidity is incredibly valuable. We have almost 50% of our trades that have price improvement versus traditional methods of execution. So we remain highly confident that we have an important role to play in the high yield markets and that we are super excited about this being the very beginning of what we expect to be a three or four-year period of higher volatility after a long period of significant quantitative easing that suppressed yields and volatility in the past. So that is our view.
Christopher Gerosa: And Alex, I'll just add. The high yield market volumes were down in Q1. Yet, we're seeing higher penetration of our open trading in high yield. So people are finding that cost savings value in our open trading solution in high yield and certainly benefiting from those savings. So we are seeing that growth of our high yield through open trading, but high yield as I look at it as just one part of a sizable story here at MarketAxess. And if you really look at this quarter more broadly, you see records, we mentioned many of these, but record total trading volume, record treasury volume, record emerging market volume, record muni volume, record PT volume, record automation volume, record number of active clients, record Mid-X volume, our record diversity dealer volume, record on Live Markets. And I have to add record green bond trading in the quarter $16 billion in green bonds and a record – we planted a record number of trees, 82,000 trees in the quarter. So high yield is important, but we have lots of products here at MarketAxess that are hitting records in that quarter, which again, high yield and high grade market volumes were down in the quarter.
Alexander Blostein: Totally, and over time, look, obviously it'll be important to diversify the business away from high yield IG, which are obviously still the majority of the revenue base. My second question is around the deal of migration dynamic. You guys highlighted data in the press release and on the call as well, sounds like a handful move to a fixed distribution plan within other credits. Can you give us a sense of how much that impacted the fee per million in the other bucket? And just taking a step back as industry volumes of volatility and credit picks up, should we expect more of that migration and how do you think that'll impact the fee per million in the other credit bucket albeit again, a lot of it is going to be mixed dependent, but I guess maybe holding mix steady?
Richard McVey: Yes. So the dealer migration impact on the other credit is probably roughly about $3 per dealer move. And you saw the nice pickup of the increase in the distribution fees. And to my point earlier, it's a win-win for us because it's a sign that these high yield dealers are going to trade more on a platform. They recognize the economies of scale being on that fixed distribution fee plan and it increases our recurring revenue. As we look forward with other credit, we'd expect the mix shift in the products was impacted by an increased level of EM local market trading in the first quarter. But as high yield volume picks up, they command a much higher fee capture. So we'd expect that to balance out as we look forward in the other credit fee capture.
Alexander Blostein: Super. Very helpful. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back to Rick McVey for his final remarks.
Richard McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
Operator: And with that, we end our call for today. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on January 26, 2022.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci : Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiatives; and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results and our full year 2022 guidance. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.  For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year results. 2021 was an important year of investment and execution on the long-term growth strategy we outlined at our recent Investor Day. Importantly, we maintained a strong leadership position in the U.S. credit institutional client e-trading space. The Institutional Clients segment is the largest segment in global credit markets and the highest quality order flow for banks and other market makers.  Our international credit business shows strong momentum, reaching new highs in estimated market share for global emerging markets and Eurobonds. Large banks report that MarketAxess is now the largest e-trading venue in emerging market debt trading in all regions around the world. Open Trading continues to be a key differentiator in our liquidity offering, and we have added new and valuable trading protocols in both credit and rates. Approximately 1,700 counterparty firms were active in Open Trading during the year, driving over $500 million in transaction cost savings. We are the only major fixed income marketplace fully promoting all-to-all trading across all products and regions. Beyond our leadership in our core business, we made significant progress expanding our foundation for growth in new product areas. Our portfolio trading launch in May led to rapid adoption among approximately 68 large investor firms and 14 dealers. Portfolio trading is a natural complement to our leadership in bid and offer list trading, which sees over 1,000 bond basket inquiries per day. Our goal is to be the # 1 portfolio trading provider this year.  U.S. government bond volume on MarketAxess reached a new record of $4.1 trillion in 2021. Importantly, we are seeing growing large dealer and investor participation due to the launch of our all-to-all U.S. Treasury Live Markets order book. Client onboarding is expected to accelerate this quarter.  In municipal bond trading, the combination of our organic growth this year and the integration of the fully electronic volume for MuniBrokers creates the largest e-trading platform in the muni market with plenty of runway ahead for growth. As we start 2022, our foundation for growth with global clients, a diversified product base and a wide range of trading protocols is stronger than ever. Slide 4 highlights our full year results. For the full year, MarketAxess reported our 13th straight year of record revenues. 2021 credit trading conditions were unusually quiet following a robust year in 2020. Taken in the aggregate, our 2-year compound growth rate for revenue was 17%, consistent with long-term averages. Operating income compound growth was 16% during the same period.  Importantly, our investments in geographic and product diversification are paying off with 24% 2-year compound revenue growth in product areas outside of our core U.S. corporate bond business. Full year records in estimated market share were set in 2021 in U.S. high yield, emerging markets, Eurobonds and municipal bonds. The health of our business also comes through with a new record for active trading firms as well as client firms trading 3 or more products. Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions in 2021 were challenging due to historically low credit spreads and low credit spread volatility. Low volatility reduces price dispersion and compresses bid offer spreads. Total credit market volumes reported by TRACE and MarketAxess post-trade were down in all major product areas year-over-year as a result of the low volatility. Volatility in rates markets is showing improvement, driving increased activity in our Open Trading U.S. Treasury marketplace.  I believe that the extended period of Central Bank quantitative easing led to historically low interest rates and depressed volatility. The combination of strong economic growth and much higher inflation is causing central banks to reduce bond purchases and prepare for rate increases. I believe this will lead to more normal levels of interest rates and bond market volatility in the quarters ahead. With 4 important trading days remaining in January, high-grade and high-yield estimated market share is running similar to Q1 last year, while TRACE market volumes are down about 17%. EM market share is running well above last year with estimated volumes down about 7%. Our U.S. treasury average daily volume is up approximately 35% from last January. Slide 6 illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing. All of the major product areas trading on MarketAxess are in early stages of electronification. We believe that the trading efficiency and transaction cost savings available to dealers and investors will ultimately lead to electronic market share of over 50% in global fixed income. We have established a strong leadership position in U.S. high-grade, high-yield and global emerging markets. We believe our competitive position is stronger than ever in Eurobonds and municipal bonds and we now have a unique offering with compelling liquidity in U.S. treasuries. Open Trading delivers additional all-to-all liquidity in global fixed income trading and expands market participation. Trading automation and Open Trading provide the ingredients for a higher trading velocity in the years ahead. We will continue to invest to capture this large opportunity for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments in new initiatives.
Chris Gerosa: Thanks, Rick. Slide 7 provides an update on Open Trading and protocol expansion. Our All-to-All Open Trading solution continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy across all products. In the fourth quarter, over 29,000 orders and $15 billion in notional value were available daily through our Open Trading marketplace. A record of nearly 1,700 firms were active across our Open Trading network during the quarter. Dealers are increasingly seeking anonymous all-to-all liquidity. Dealer RFQ volume grew 27% in 2021 to $272 billion. The increased diversity of participation continues to drive cost saving opportunities despite compressed credit market spreads. Clients saved an estimated $128 million in transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements in Open Trading. Our investment in new protocols is also fueling growth. U.S. Treasury volume executed over our Live Markets order book reached $1.2 trillion during the quarter. Early adopters of live markets for treasuries report high-quality trade execution with unique order capabilities relative to incumbents. We also expanded our live market order book to new credit markets with support for U.S. high-yield liquidity. Lastly, our mid-accessions protocol was recently expanded beyond Eurobonds to include support for U.S. investment grade and U.S. high-yield bonds.  Slide 8 illustrates the powerful diversification of our model across markets, protocols and services. Providing choice across markets and trading protocols for all participants is a key competitive advantage. Investing in new markets by offering innovative electronic trading solutions and the development of robust data and post-trade services to complement the fixed income trading life cycle are critical to our long-term growth strategy.  Following enhancements made to our portfolio trading functionality in 2021, we saw increased engagement that drove record volume of $13.1 billion in the fourth quarter. We have seen significant traction with this functionality in a relatively short amount of time. Municipal bond trading on MarketAxess grew 42% to $6.6 billion in the quarter. Additionally, $17.9 billion in volume was conducted through MuniBrokers in the fourth quarter. The integration of MuniBrokers into the Market Access trading system was completed in the fourth quarter to combine our client-to-dealer network with dealer-to-dealer workflows using our Open Trading solution.  The acquisition of Regulatory Reporting Hub helped drive total post-trade services revenue to $9.4 million in the quarter, up 43% year-over-year. Organic Post trade revenue was up 18% as clients were onboarded for new SFTR services. Demand for intelligent market data solutions within fixed income continues to grow. Given our significant bond trading market share and our expanded regulatory reporting services, we are in a unique position to offer differentiated data products. This includes the launching of our liquid Index, the MarketAxess investment-grade 400 and enhancements made to our AI-powered pricing engine Composite+ with the launch of our CP+ total market, which produces a price on over 250,000 bonds globally. Slide 9 highlights the growing momentum of automation and credit trading. Automated trading on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to $44.4 billion in volume and over 242,000 trades. Today, Auto-X represents 19% of total trade count and 7% of our total volume.  The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.6 million algo responses in the fourth quarter, up 18% from the same period last year. The growth of automation and algo pricing is also driving a steady increase in the average number of responses to any inquiry on the MarketAxess platform. In the fourth quarter, there were, on average, 8.5 responses per inquiry. This demonstrates improved liquidity on the platform and increased engagement from our diverse investor and dealer community. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials.
Chris Gerosa: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 12, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Fourth quarter revenue was $165 million, down 4% from the prior year, a 6% decrease in credit trading volume and lower of our all credit fee capture resulted in a 6% decline in commissions. Partially offsetting this decline is commission -- decline in commission revenue was the 9% increase in information services revenue and a 43% increase in post-trade services revenue. The $2.8 million increase in fourth quarter post-trade services revenue included $1.8 million of incremental revenue from Reporting Hub acquisition.  The sequential decrease in other net is due to foreign currency transaction gains that did not repeat in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.1% in the fourth quarter and our full year effective tax rate came in at 22.8%. The higher effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower excess tax benefits and return to provision adjustments related to new state income tax filing requirements. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $86.3 million and diluted EPS was $1.37. On Slide 13, we laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. The 11% decline in variable transaction fees was attributable to lower U.S. credit trading volume and lower overall fee capture. The year-over-year decline in U.S. high-grade fees per million was mainly due to shorter duration, which was driven by an increase in yields and a decrease in the average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. The year-over-year increase in other credit distribution fees was due to the migration of certain dealers to a high-yield fixed fee plan from an all-variable fee plan and $1.2 million of subscription and license fees from the MuniBrokers acquisition. Slide 14 provides the expense detail. Fourth quarter expenses were up 16% year-over-year, including an incremental $5 million of operating expenses, amputation of acquired intangibles and nonrecurring integration costs associated with the Reg Reporting Hub and MuniBrokers acquisitions. If we exclude these acquisition-related cost, expenses were up 10.1%.  The increase in compensation and benefits reflect higher salary and benefit expense as we continue to invest in talent to support our product and geographical expansion. The $4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense includes $1.8 million of acquired intangible amortization expense from acquisitions and higher software development costs as we continue to invest in trading system enhancements. The 25% increase year -- or the 25% year-over-year decline in clearing costs is due to lower Open Trading volume and transaction cost savings from our clearing model conversions. On Slide 15, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of December 31, our cash and investments were $543 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $297 million. During the fourth quarter, we paid out $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased approximately 112,000 shares for a total cost of $45 million.  We exhausted the $100 million repurchase program that was approved last year, and our Board of Directors authorized a new $150 million share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we did not have any borrowings on the $500 million revolving credit facility or the $200 million secured facility. Our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.70. On Slide 16, we have our 2022 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures and the effective tax rate. We expect the total 2022 expenses will be in the range of $385 million to $415 million. Approximately 60% of the increase is due to our continued investment in the trading system and personnel to support our product and geographical expansion.  2022 capital expenditures are expected to range from $58 million to $62 million, of which, roughly 2/3 relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements. We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2022 will be in the range of 24% to 26%. The increase in the effective tax rate versus 2021 is driven significantly lower estimated tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Chris. In summary, 2021 was an important year of investment and execution to expand our growth cylinders and increase product diversification. Our competitive position remains strong in U.S. credit and has improved materially in international product areas. Our investments have led to attractive ROI and free cash flow for our shareholders. We believe that the future will bring more normal fixed income market conditions with higher volatility and growing trading velocity. And finally, we would like to welcome Steve Davidson to MarketAxess as our Head of Investor Relations. Steve spent several years with us as a new public company beginning in 2005, and then worked with the New York Stock Exchange and MSCI. Steve and Dave Cresci will both be available to analysts and investors to provide the information and transparency you need from us. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler.
Rich Repetto: I'll welcome Steve as well because we know him from the past, he'll be helpful. So first question is, I guess, for Rick and I guess, the non-Concannon Chris on expenses. So it's an 11% increase at the midpoint similar to the 10% this year -- this past year. I guess, the question is, if revenues were either significantly up and we get volatility and spreads widening or if it was flat to down if we get more of the same, how could that -- how variable could the expense guidance be? I guess, how could you move expenses?
Chris Gerosa: Yes. Rich, thank you for the question. If you noticed, we did widen the goalpost in this year's guidance range from last year, it was around $20 million. This year, the goalposts are $30 million, recognizing that favorable or adverse market conditions can drive our variable expense up or down. And if you look at the overall expense base, our variable expenses are roughly 18% to 20% of the total expense base. And so we’ve recognized that in the year like last year, we saw variable expenses in the low end of the range, and that's what caused us to reset our guidance towards the end of the year. But as you look next year or this year into 2022, you need to keep in mind that 20% of that operating expense base is subject to market condition volatility.
Rich Repetto: Got it. That's helpful. Then my follow-up would be for the Concannon Chris, the Chris Concannon, and that would be on Slide 9, Chris, like I just want to get an update because on the new products that we rolled out, the all-to-all trading for munis and rates, I guess, when you say client RFQ, is that the -- does that mean all-to-all trading is rolled out for those products?
Chris Concannon: So thanks, Rich. So for munis, we have the full complement of both direct dealer disclosed RFQ as well as the all-to-all solution. In fact, in muni all-to-all is quite a sizable part of the muni business. It's about 46% of our volume is all-to-all in munis. In our rate solution in U.S. treasuries, -- our current platform is an all-to-all platform. So the live markets that we use in treasuries is an all-to-all streaming price platform, and it's anonymous, and that's the piece that we're seeing growth and had a sizable growth in the fourth quarter. Our RFQ complement to that platform was rolled out in the fourth quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, we plan to have all-to-all and disclosed RFQ for treasury this quarter. So that's being rolled out as we speak and worked on as we speak. And we're pretty excited about an all-to-all solution for things like off the runs and even on the runs. So we're pretty excited about the rollout coming this quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the opportunity set that you see for electronifying securitized markets, so ABS, non-agency RMBS, CLOs, among other products. Where do you see the industry today on that front in terms of electronifying? It seems pretty nascent days. I guess, how do you see that evolving over the next couple of years? Can you talk about some of the hurdles that you see for that part of the marketplace? And how do you see potentially overcoming some of those hurdles?
Rick McVey: Sure. I'll start with that one, and thanks for the question. It's -- the level of electronification there today is extremely low. The hurdles are fragmentation and generally lower levels of secondary turnover. But as we talk to clients and dealers, they do believe that an open trading solution makes a lot of sense for those markets. So it is on the list of potential future product expansion that we have here. What we've outlined today are the things that are live that we're working on now, and we're excited about in terms of impact on revenue and earnings growth this year. But clearly, the securitized markets are on the list, and I would have those in the bucket of potential product expansion that fits with the protocols that we run in credit.
Michael Cyprys: Great. And maybe just a follow-up on the expense side. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate a bit on the investment spend. I think you mentioned about 60% of the overall increase in the expense base for '22 is coming from investments. I guess, maybe you could just elaborate on what those investments are? How you're thinking about head count growth into '22? And maybe what are some of the items that did not make it on the investment list for this year that maybe could be on for '23?
Chris Gerosa: Yes. It’s a good question. And the investments of 60%, it really comprises of investing in our people, investing in the trading system enhancements and as we expand not only the product and protocol offerings, but recognizing we're expanding our footprint in Asia and Europe. And so it's a combination of headcount and our software development and system enhancement investments.  With respect to any investments that we don't have on that roster, I don't think we're tabling anything until 2023. We're recognizing that there's an existing list of opportunities that we want to capitalize on and they're all embedded in part of that investment agenda for 2022.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please check your line. Please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies.
Dan Fannon: My question is on the buyback authorization as well as the 4Q repurchase activity. I believe, previously, you guys had talked about mainly just offsetting dilution. So wondering about your kind of view going forward in terms of execution of that authorization. And maybe also just in the context of M&A and capital deployment, update us on your thoughts around inorganic opportunities as well.
Rick McVey: Yes, Dan, that's a good question. Our capital management strategy continues to remain the same. Our #1 investment priority is to continue to invest in the trading platform. We continue to seek opportunistic M&A opportunities and the balance of our capital management program focuses on returning capital to the shareholders either in the form of dividends and repurchase programs.  During the fourth quarter, we recognized there was a dislocation in the share price. We did have the existing program, which had around roughly $80 million of capacity heading into the fourth quarter. So we employ that strategy to capitalize on the opportunity and accelerate the offsetting dilution from equity grants in the future. But the fact that the Board approved the new $150 million plan is to the ordinary course of business gives the management team flexibility to enter the market either opportunistically or to continue with our strategy to offset dilution from equity awards given to the employees.
Dan Fannon: Got it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, if you could update us on the outlook for the non-transactional revenues? At Investor Day, you talked a lot about the market size and the TAMs. I was wondering as you've kind of improved the product offering, we should see some acceleration as we think about '22 versus the low double-digit numbers, I believe you've cited before for post-trade and information services?
Chris Gerosa: So Dan, great question. On our Information Services, obviously, we're seeing a double-digit growth in 2021. We're excited about the new products. CP+ and Axess All have been really the drivers in that growth engine in 2021. We're launching really two new products entering into '22. Our total markets -- our CP+ total markets, which really expands the overall coverage and another product, tradability, which really allows people to understand the true depth of the market and how to execute in the market. It's quite valuable in portfolio construction, sizing orders as you enter the market. So really critical information that we're launching here in '22. So excited about the opportunities, continued growth in CP+ and then the new product total markets. Post-trade, obviously, you saw it grow year-over-year quite substantially, given the increase in Regulatory Reporting -- the transaction -- closing of the transaction, Regulatory Reporting Hub. We've integrated about 73% of the clients in 2021, expect additional integrations throughout the first quarter. The great opportunity around our post-trade business is it is a resource of data for our information services business. So phenomenal resource of trade data across all of Europe. And it gave us the opportunity in '21 to launch our CP+ for European government bonds, which we have a small but growing footprint but largely leverage the value of that post-trade business. So pretty excited about '22, the new products and the growth of our really flagship product, CP+.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Great. And also welcome to Steve as well. Maybe just, Chris or Rick, if we can zoom in on portfolio trading, if my calculations are right, it looks like around 1% of your high-grade volumes in 4Q -- I guess, correct me if I'm wrong on that, but maybe if you could share your view on expanding that? Obviously, we've seen traction this year from your main competitor. But if you can talk about how you see that market evolving for portfolio trading in '22, given potentially higher volatility in corporate bonds? And then how you see that tracking versus your list trading business? And what kind of, I guess, market share would you like to get to in the portfolio by the end of the year?
Rick McVey: Sure. Good question. And as I've said in the past, I do think the blend between portfolio trading and bid and offer list will be dependent on market volatility and market conditions. And this year, we did see strong growth in portfolio trading during several quarters of very benign credit market conditions, but it's important to keep it in context. The peak months, we estimate we're around 6% of TRACE secondary volume conducted through portfolio trades.  And it's kind of interesting because the tracker that we have on TRACE to identify portfolio trades is currently showing about 25 portfolio trades on average per day. And we've already had 14 dealers involved. So there's a lot of competition in a low-vol market for a limited number of portfolio trades. But importantly, they're large in line items and large in volume. So it's an important piece for us to offer. And we are pleased with the progress we made since the May launch and the number of clients and dealers that are involved. If you look back at 2020, when volatility was very high, clearly, the added liquidity of Open Trading in bid and offer list was essential to the functioning in the market during the course of that higher volatility. It's kind of interesting because even in the last 2 months with a very slight increase in volatility from the end of November through this week, we're seeing portfolio trading percentage of TRACE decline. And that period has been closer to 4% or a little bit more of secondary trading in TRACE. So we're starting to see that it gets more difficult for dealers to manage the risk in large portfolios when there is a pickup in volatility. And as a result, we think that clients toggle back to bid and offer list and use Open Trading in a deeper and broader pool of liquidity during those periods. Our belief, as I mentioned earlier, it's unlikely that volatility in credit would be as low in '22 as it was last year. It's highly unusual to have two years in a row like that. And my belief is that at the end of quantitative easing from central banks around the world is a big deal. They have been buying up a lot of the net supply in government bonds and even mortgages here. And so if market forces are at work to determine bond prices, I think it's likely to come with greater volatility. We're well aware of the appeal of portfolio trading to clients and that's why we have been investing very actively in that solution. In terms of my expectations, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are after being #1 in portfolio trading as we are elsewhere in other protocols in global credit. And we believe we're making the investments and we have the client connectivity and dealer connectivity and sales effort around that community to achieve that goal.
Chris Concannon: And Brian, I'll just add on portfolio trading. We are seeing demand for, as Rick mentioned, a very long line item. So we are up to 1,500 line items. We're expanding that out even further this quarter. So there is demand for very large line items, sizable trades, but it does go across high grade, high yield. We're now seeing portfolio trades in Eurobonds, which is helping our market share there and even emerging market bonds.  So we're seeing a diversity of product and our solution and our liquidity, the support of our dealer community is certainly helping us support portfolio trading demands. We're also seeing, at month-end, higher demand for portfolio tradings as our clients try to move sizable portions of their portfolio. There is demand for portfolio trading at month-end. But as Rick mentioned, we want to be #1 in portfolio trading. We want to use our list trading and our portfolio trading as ways with analytics to compare what's the right trade for the client? Is it an individual list trade based on our unique proprietary pricing, or is it a portfolio trade? And we think we can provide better analytics around both list trading and portfolio trading for clients to make the right decision at the individual bond level.
Brian Bedell: That's super interesting. Maybe just a follow-up on the -- on pricing and the potential. If we ease up with quantitative easing and move into quantitative tightening type of environment, what's that? If we do get a pick up in the yield to maturity, what kind of impact that could have on your -- on the pricing? I know that tends to be a favorable impact.
Rick McVey: Yes, I'll start, and Chris can follow-up on any specifics. But the only product that has a duration as a factor in our average pricing is U.S. high grade. And so higher rates, all else equal, reduces the duration of bonds and as a result, reduces fee capture. The rest is dependent on the average maturity of bonds traded not surprising that as we enter into this new environment in '22, where there are expectations of the Fed raising rates that we're seeing a slightly lower average years to maturity of the high-grade bonds traded on our platform. So we're happy to follow up with it. The historical goalposts are pretty clear. Our personal view is that, bring on the volatility because we excel in more volatile markets and the offset in the benefit that we get with higher volatility and higher rates in market share and volume gains as well or it it -- even if we get slightly lower duration of average bonds traded in high-grade.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein: Apologies for phone issues earlier. I wanted to circle back on the commentary, Rick, you just made around capture rates and sort of pricing dynamics. So it feels like most of the movement we've seen in capture rate has been really a function of the mix and not so much direct kind of pricing changes. As you continue to evolve the business, are you starting to see any changes in pricing from a more competitive perspective across all the kind of asset classes that you guys trade? And maybe what are the areas we see that to be a little more pronounced than others? And then with respect to portfolio trading specifically, could you talk about how your offering and the pricing there compares to the competitors' offering in the same product?
Rick McVey: Sure. On the broader question, Alex, I think if you really look at the blended fee capture for our primary competitor here in the U.S., there's not a big difference in their average credit fee capture versus The MarketAxess average. So the small difference is actually explained by the much larger high-yield and EM franchise that we have relative to that competitor with higher fee capture in those product areas. So there really aren't significant differences in the fee capture when you look at the blended rates that are being communicated publicly. With respect to PT, we think we're very competitive on pricing. And really, when markets get more volatile, our Open Trading cost savings go up. So we're delivering more value to the clients due to the transaction cost savings, which is why we've had a very long track record of maintaining our pricing. And then the last thing I'll say is that there is a new pricing scheme in our space as well, as you know, broadly communicated by dealers and investors that Bloomberg has started to charge transaction fees. And when we look outside the U.S., Bloomberg has been our biggest competitor. So the fact that they've gone from 0 transaction fees to now charging and doing something more comparable to what we've always done is actually a benefit to us on a competitive basis. And what we are hearing from the large banks, when we look at global EM, in particular, is our very significant share gains across the world in EM are partly because of the expansion of the electronic market and partly because of a strengthening of our competitive position, especially vis-a-vis Bloomberg.  So we feel good about our pricing relative to the value we deliver back to our clients and even in an incredibly benign year for credit trading, our transaction cost savings were very close to total transaction fees. So we think that the value for money equation holds up very well. And the large banks, as you know, favor the fixed fee and markup models that we have here in the U.S. So we think we're in a really good place around our fee models.
Alex Blostein: Great. And then my follow-up is around the REIT's business. And obviously, given the pickup in rates volatility and the movement rates we're seeing across the board, that should bode quite well for volumes this year. What are some key kind of milestones you're hoping to achieve with that business this year, sort of legacy liquidity edge? Maybe an update on where you guys stand with respect to net spotting and sort of integration with the rest of the business?
Chris Concannon: Sure, Alex. On the rate solution, obviously, we look at that market. It's one of the largest markets that we're active in and it still has a phone-based offering. So we do see sizable share on the phone -- conducted on the phone, nonelectronic. There are two large competitors in the space. From a pricing standpoint, on the last topic, we are very competitively priced against the competition. So we feel good about our pricing position as we grow share in that market. We really have two offerings in that market, a live streaming order book offering, which has been growing, and that was a direct result of the LiquidityEdge transaction a number of years ago. The other offering is our traditional RFQ offering. Those two offerings are combined side-to-side, which makes it quite attractive for our clients to decide if you're trading a more liquid product, you can trade it in real time on a live market. If you're trading a less liquid off the run product, you can trade it via a traditional RFQ, which is really offered by the competition. So we have quite sizable goals in that market, particularly given our offering is an all-to-all live order book with an all-to-all RFQ supported by our all-to-all marketplace. So we think we can grow that market over the course of '22.
Rick McVey: Just to add on top of that as well is that, it's really interesting to us that in -- as we start '22 that the majority of institutional investor treasury electronic business is still conducted in an RFQ to 5 protocol, which is where both of the incumbents are with their investor offering. My belief is that the market is fully ready and welcomes an order book solution. And we think we are the right provider for that solution. We have 1,700 counterparties that can access the order book that Chris described. We have merged the 2 broker dealers. So there's no additional documentation any longer for clients to access that pool. We've made important post-trade STP solutions and average ticket pricing to help with investor activity. We have one more piece that will be completed this quarter in terms of order management connectivity to make it even easier to access. So when you think about the treasury market, the on-the-run cash market is trading one way. The U.S. Treasury futures market has been trading in an exchange order book for decades. And we think everything we hear from both dealers and investors is they welcome a new offering with an order book because of the additional flexibility and the additional distribution through this very wide client network that we now have installed on MarketAxess. So we're super excited about it. We recognize that we have to have the RRP offering as well, especially as you think about off-the-run treasuries. But here again, we think Open Trading and order books have a role to play, and we're happy to be out in front providing that to a very large network of clients and dealers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW.
Kyle Voigt: Maybe can I just ask a question about the Mid-X launch in the U.S. Just wondering if there's any numbers you can share in terms of the uptake of that Mid-X offering in Europe thus far to help us think about how meaningful this launch in the U.S. could be for your 2022 growth. And I also think that the Mid-X offering in the U.S. is all-to-all from day 1 of the launch. I just want to confirm that. And I'm just curious to hear your thoughts as to whether that's the kind of key differentiator for that protocol versus competitors that will drive adoption.
Chris Concannon: Sure. Great question. Mid-X is by definition all-to-all. It leverages that all-to-all marketplace. So it's a fully anonymous where anyone can participate in that match. In our European -- our Eurobond Mid-X offering, we saw a $3.2 billion in Q4 volume. Sizes of -- average trade sizes or match sessions are still quite sizable, close to $300 million. So we continue to see demand for a session-based trading in Europe. It is particularly dominated by dealers unloading inventory. So it's truly a -- first a dealer-to-dealer offering. Clients are still taking their time engaging the Mid-X solution.  With regard to U.S. high-grade and U.S. high yield, we see particular demand for our dealer RFQ. Again, that's really a dealer solution for dealers to exit inventory, unwanted inventory using the traditional RFQ through the Open Trading network. Mid-X is just now launching here in the U.S. We're excited about offering a session-based solution to dealers here in the U.S. as well. And we continue to hear demand from our dealer community on a session-based solution for them to load large amounts of inventory looking for a mid-market priced execution. We are using our premium CP+ mid-price, which is quite an attractive product compared to some of the competitor pricing dynamics. So pretty excited about Mid-X for high grade and high yield in 2022.
Rick McVey: I would just expand on that with one other piece. There's some interesting similarity between the market environment that seems to work well for sessions in the market environment that works well for portfolio trading because sessions depend on a relatively matched order book of buys and sells and a lot of confidence in a model-driven mid-market price. And those two things decline when volatility picks up.  So if you look back at Q2 last year in 2020, when you had very high volatility, those protocols did not work as well. And sessions-based, when we study the TRACE tape as we do very regularly, when we look at sessions-based volume within the TRACE tape, that too has declined in a material way since late November running right through this week. So these protocols are the best position we can be in is what exactly what we're doing, and that's to offer the whole range of protocols across our entire network all supported by Open Trading. And there will be times where the Open Trading RFQ is the dominant theme, and there will be other times where portfolio trading and matching sessions work well. And we're really pleased that our investments are putting us in a place where we've got the entire offering, and we can benefit from any of those environments.
Kyle Voigt: That's very helpful. And then I just had maybe a bigger picture question on treasuries and treasury market structure. Obviously, as you noted, it's still very bifurcated market structure between the dealer-to-dealer space and the client-to-dealer space and you're trying to kind of bridge that. I guess, I'm just -- I just wanted some more clarity on two pieces. One, do you think there's going to be any real material regulatory change in terms of there's been a lot of talk about treasury clearing? Do you think that's realistic to get some sort of proposal this year? I guess, what are the expectations there? And will that help kind of this transition to all-to-all whatsoever or are you the solution, and basically, you don't think that that's going to have a big impact to the adoption of all-to-all in the treasury space? And then secondarily, just in terms of a lot of other platforms, I think, have tried to launch more all-to-all solutions in this space before trying to open up some of the inner dealer offerings to buy-side clients. But it sounds like you're really encouraged by the uptake you're seeing, and it's kind of a rig opportunities, right, for these buy-side clients to be more engaged and actually use the platform and there's a lot of appetite for that. So do you think it's just -- the times come for that, or is it just you're hearing more louder cries from the buy side that they really need this? I'm just curious to get a bit better sense of what your clients are really talking to you about in terms of the desire for that all-to-all offering?
Rick McVey: Sure. So Kyle, two very different questions, but on the same topic. But first, on regulatory focus. There is a lot of regulatory focus on the U.S. treasury market. As you know, in fact, I think as we speak, there's an SEC call, a public call going on about ATSG, which is the rulemaking that they're undertaking around the new category within ATS specific to the government bond market. And I think the observation is that the fragmentation in the market has not worked particularly well at times of very high volatility, and there have been significant gaps in pricing and liquidity that are really important to U.S. treasury into the functioning of all fixed income markets because the U.S. treasury market is the benchmark for the entire world. So we think that the regulatory focus will remain favorable to all-to-all trading solutions. And some of the thinking around that is that central clearing would be a good outcome to help to support all-to-all trading as well as less risk in the settlement process for U.S. treasuries. So we obviously have been the most successful Open Trading platform without central clearing for corporate bonds, and we've been able to support that successfully with our own settlement solutions. But longer term, I think there's a lot of benefit to centralized clearing solutions. And there's a foundation at DTCC to be able to help to promote that down the road, and we'll have to see how the regulators view that. But we do see some potential benefits of moving in that direction. As far as -- I don't think you've ever seen a foundation like ours that already had success in Open Trading, has 350 or 400 dealers and 1,700 clients all connected with order management system connectivity and counterparty authorization to trade through MarkeAxess before in any of the other offerings. So we have liquidity. We have a very broad client network that's already -- that has the OMS connectivity, has the counterparty and settlement agreements already done. And we think that, that's creating a really unique offering to complement the offering that's been out there for a long time. So I think when you look at the others, they had the inter-dealer liquidity but they really did not have the functionality or the OMS or the counterparty connections to the end clients at all. And as we've seen, it takes a long time to build that up, and we've been at it -- we're starting year '22. So we have that network already built up. We're fully committed to all-to-all trading, and I think we are the obvious choice to promote this in a successful way.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Just one question from me. What's your view on why industry-wide credit trading volumes have been so tepid thus far in January despite volatility picking up a bit? Trading volumes in other asset classes have been reasonably healthy. And related to that, how have TRACE volumes typically fared during periods of Fed rate hikes?
Rick McVey: Yes. So I think that part of what's going on is the risk-off mentality. But the reality, Patrick, is that the volatility that we've seen recently has been mostly focused on the rate space. So we have price volatility in the corporate bond market, but we do not yet have much spread volatility. If you look, there's been a modest widening of credit spreads from where we were for the two or three quarters leading into the end of last year. So my expectation is you're more likely to get both throughout this year, but credit spreads have been pretty stable so far. And we do notice from the Fed data that the dealer balance sheets are pretty low right now. They were going into year-end, as you would expect, but they remain low in the weekly data that we've seen pretty recently. So I think there's a -- certainly a chance that this is the calm before the storm. But I do think right now, the volatility has been focused on the rate space more than it has credit spreads. And I would expect that we'll see better turnover in credit products when we see better volatility in spreads.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. And then, I guess, to follow up on that one. When you think back in periods where the Fed has been hiking, so 2015, 2016, was that like generally a favorable environment as you guys were kind of looking at thinking about market share trends and industry-wide volumes, or what are the puts and takes as you kind of think about what might happen as the Fed potentially raises during 2022?
Rick McVey: We're happy to follow-up with more specific data, which obviously has been public in our reporting for a long time. I can tell you, there's a very clear correlation between the periods where we've done the best with market share and revenue growth and volatility. So I think it's a safe assumption given how different the central bank environment could be over the next two years relative to where we've been that the outcome of that could very well be better fixed income market volatility. And those are the environments where we do the best.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler.
Rich Repetto: Most of my follow-ups have been asked and answered. But one quick one. I'm just trying to understand what's the driver when you say you're going to take the #1 position in portfolio trading? So what leaps you beyond the competitors, the number of dealers signed up, or -- I'm just trying to understand how you get to that position.
Rick McVey: Well -- so look, I think we're really encouraged by the last 6 months and how much of the PT share we've been able to attract onto the MarketAxess system. But Rich, I think going back to my prepared remarks, we've been the leader in this space for a long time. And we've been going head-to-head with Tradeweb since 2002 when they launched their corporate bond offering. And we have successfully innovated and led that market for a long time. So the reality is the client eyeballs and the client mind share and attention is largely on the system. And as I mentioned, we do well over 1,000 bid and offer list every day. So that compared to the 25 portfolio trades, now that we have a terrific technology solution for portfolio trades, it sits alongside those 1,200 or so bid and offer lists that clients are trading every day. We have primary sales focus on the credit trading desk. We have all 14 of the dealers that we know that are active in portfolio trading that are live on MarketAxess. So we have the same liquidity pool of dealers. Those dealers just happen to do most of their clients’ trading on MarketAxess not any of our competitors. So we think we have an incumbent position that's going to benefit. As Chris mentioned earlier, getting that functionality, so it's easy to toggle back and forth based on market conditions and the situation between bid and offer list and portfolio trading is where we think clients want to be. So we're encouraged by the last 6 months, and we think there's a lot more to come, and we're focused on taking the lead in the portfolio trading space.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on October 20, 2021. I'd now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2021 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and international growth. Chris Concannon, President and COO, will discuss product expansion and automation. And then, Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter 2021 results. Q3 total revenue was $162 million, down 1% year-over-year. Operating income was $74 million and operating margin was 46%. EPS of $1.52 was down 15%, reflecting our ongoing investments in new data, trading and post-trade solutions. Credit market trading faces headwinds currently with a combination of historically low credit spreads and credit spreads volatility. These conditions have persisted over the last three quarters and history suggests they will revert to the mean over time. Our international business is showing strong growth through volume and market share gains in euro bonds and emerging markets, post-trade services and product expansion. We are pleased to add Chinese government bonds to our offering through China Bond Connect and CIBM Direct. Slide 3 provides an update on market conditions. Market volumes have been negatively impacted by the current low levels of bond yields, credit spreads and volatility. During these periods, price dispersion of bids and offers shrinks temporarily. Our liquidity and pricing advantage comes through most clearly at times of normal to high spreads and volatility. And we believe that there are many factors that could possibly impact bond volatility in the periods ahead. As yields have started to increase from historically low levels, average years to maturity traded on our system has come down about 6%. Average years to maturity is one of the factors that causes fluctuations in our high grade fee capture. We are watching the emerging news on inflation, supply chain disruptions, labour shortages and the China real estate market closely. We believe that it is likely that we will see tapering of central bank bond buying in the periods ahead which is likely to lead to more normalized yield levels and volatility in bond markets around the world. Slide 4 highlights, our growth in international markets. In spite of the low levels of yields around the world we are showing strong growth in our emerging market and Eurobond product areas. Eurobond volumes are up 22% year-over-year against a backdrop of lower market volumes. Our estimated market share reached new highs in eurobonds during the quarter. Emerging market volumes are up 19% with estimated market volumes up 1%, reflecting share gains in global debt trading. We are seeing strong growth rates in both hard currency EM bonds denominated in dollars, euros in yen as well as local market trading. The addition of China increases our local market coverage to 28 local markets across Latin America, EMEA APAC regions. This quarter, we set new records in global active trading clients and international client firms. This expands our broad client network and creates additional cross-selling opportunities. We are underway with client onboarding for China Bond Connect and expect an active quarter ahead. As the second largest government bond market in the world, China provides a meaningful increase in our total market opportunity. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on product expansion and automation.
Chris Concannon: Thanks Rick. Slide 5 provides an update on open trading and product expansion. Open trading continues to support credit market liquidity by offering all participants the chance to engage with the market. In the third quarter, over 25,000 orders and $13 billion in notional value was available daily through our open trading marketplace. Dealers have also realized the benefits of open trading and are increasingly seeking anonymous all to all liquidity. Dealer RFQ volume grew 20% year-over-year to $59 billion during the quarter. The increased diversity of participation continues to drive cost saving opportunities. Despite compressed credit market spread, clients saved an estimated $121 million in transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements delivered by open trading. The acquisitions of LiquidityEdge and MuniBrokers highlight our investment in new markets and the growing application of open trading across the fixed income landscape. $910 billion of US Treasury trading volume was executed on MarketAxess in the quarter, up 22% from the prior year. We have made several enhancements to our Reach Trading offering in recent months, including our launch of All-to-All Click-to-Trade functionality and extending RFQ trading capabilities for client to dealer orders. The expansion of open trading for US Treasuries is a critical priority for us and aligns with recent G30 recommendations for an All-to-All marketplace in Treasuries. Municipal bond trading on MarketAxess grew 92% to $5.4 billion in the quarter, an additional $17.4 billion in volume was conducted through a MuniBrokers, our inner dealer electronic platform, which we currently do not include in our muni bond volume totals. Integration efforts of the MuniBroker platform are well underway and we are targeting the fourth quarter for the initial phase of our integration of the platform into our open trading network. We believe these investments in government bond and municipal bond trading solutions will add approximately 25% to our long-term addressable market opportunity. Slide 6 highlights the growing momentum of automation, and credit-trading, automated trading on market access reach new records in the quarter, growing to $42 billion in volume and over 224,000 trades, 115 firms leveraged our automated trading protocols in the quarter, up from 86 last year. Today, Auto-X represents 19% of total trade count and 7% of our total volume. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.4 million Algo responses in the third quarter up 17% from the same period last year. The growth of dealer algorithms and our automated trading tools are driving a steady increase in the average number of responses on MarketAxess. In the third quarter we saw an average of seven responses per inquiry versus 5.8 in the third quarter of 2020. This demonstrates enhancements in our liquidity as a result of the increased engagement from our diverse investor and dealer community. Slide 7 demonstrates the growth from diversifying our business initiatives. The acquisition of Regulatory Reporting Hub helped drive total post-trade services revenue to $9.4 million in the quarter, up 101% year-over-year. The addition of Continental European clients to our suite of regulatory reporting services through this acquisition has further bolstered our unique data solutions. Through these types of post-trade data sources, we have seen sizable benefits to our data solutions like Access All and Composite+. Both Axess All and Composite+ help drive our information services revenue to $9.6 million in the quarter which is up 13% year-over-year. Combined information services and post-trade revenue now account for 12% of total revenues, up from 8% in the third quarter of 2020. Following enhancements to our portfolio trading solution in May, we have seen significant traction with our new functionality. 54 unique investor firms and 13 dealers were active since May and drove record volume of $8.9 billion in the quarter. We believe our active client group is the same group of participants active in the market wide portfolio trading today. Activity in our session based protocol Mid-X reached record volumes in the quarter of $3.4 billion. We plan on expanding Mid-X beyond Eurobonds to US credit later this year. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials.
Chris Gerosa: Thank you, Chris. Slide 8 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Third quarter revenue was $162 million, down 1% from the prior year. The 5% decline in commissions was offset by the 100% uplift in post-trade revenue. The increase in post-trade revenue includes $3.4 million of trade reporting revenue generated from new clients added to the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition. Information service revenue was up 13% year over year due to new data sales and the positive impact of foreign exchange due to the weaker US dollar. The annual contract value for new recurring data contract sales for the first nine months of 2021 has exceeded all of 2020. The sequential pick up in other income was due to foreign currency transaction gains, excluding in rate activity such as foreign exchange gains and losses, we anticipate the quarterly run rate for the other income expense lines to be about $1 million of expense. The effective tax rate was 22.2% for the quarter and 21.6% year-to-date. Slide 9 provides an overview of commission revenue, trading volume and fees per million. The 9% decline in variable transaction fees was attributable to lower US credit trading volume and lower overall fee capture. The 17% decline in US high grade fees per million was mainly due to shorter duration, driven by the increase in bond yields and a decrease in the average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. We also experienced some dealer movement to a fixed fee plan from an all variable fee plan, and this explains the increase in US hybrid distribution fees as fixed fee plans provided for higher fixed distribution fees, but lower transaction fees. Other credit fees per million was lower year-over-year due to a higher mix of emerging market and Eurobond volume that command lower fees. The third quarter 2021 other credit distribution fees includes $1.2 million of MuniBrokers subscription and license fees. Slide 10 provides expense detail. Third quarter expenses were up 16% year-over-year and include $5.5 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and non-recurring integration costs associated with the regulatory reporting hub and MuniBrokers acquisitions. If we exclude these acquisition costs, expenses were up 8.4%. The increase in compensation and benefits reflects higher salary and benefit – benefit expense as we continue to add employees to support our product and geographical expansion. The $4.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, includes $2.5 million of acquired intangible amortization expense from acquisitions and higher software development costs as we continue to invest in trading system enhancements. M&A integration costs and high recruiting fees contributed to the increase in professional consulting fees year over year. The 32% decline in clearing costs reflect transaction cost savings from our strategic decision to convert to a self-learning model back in August 2020. We are updating our full year 2021 expense guidance range to $360 million to $365 million, down from a range of $370 million to $386 million. The updated expense guidance reflects, among other items, lower incentive compensation and variable clearing costs. Slide 11 provides an update on cash flow and capital management. As of September 30, our cash and investments were $458 million, and our trailing 12 month free cash flow was $320 million. During the quarter, we paid the $25 million quarterly dividend to our shareholders and repurchased approximately 9,000 shares. During the third quarter, we did not have any borrowings under one year, $500 million revolving credit facility or the $200 million secured facility. And on October 15, we replaced the one year revolving credit facility with a new three year facility. Based on our third quarter results, our board of directors approved the $0.66 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Chris. While we are experiencing slower than average growth rates in the short term, we are pleased with the expansion of our business strategy evident in new products, new protocols and new clients. We are confident market conditions in credit will improve once again highlighting the benefits of our unique open trading liquidity pool. New opportunities in China, US Treasuries, Munis, post trade and data show promise to add valuable revenue growth and diversification in the periods ahead. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. I wanted to talk about just kind of the market backdrop in understanding the context that you gave around spreads and volatility being very low, but could you talk about the competitive framework today as you think about your offering versus others and how that has – how that kind of dynamic has changed over the last couple of years?
Rick McVey: Sure. And I’m happy to do so, Dan. I'll take the first cut at that. But listen, we're starting to pilot a market conditions index and I said a year ago on this call that no one should expect a credit trading conditions of last year to continue indefinitely. I will say exactly the same this year from very low levels of volatility that you also shouldn't expect these levels of very low spreads and volatility to continue either. And we certainly as a more developed business are impacted by what is going on in the overall market. And you probably saw this quarter with fixed income trading revenue for the large banks was down 15% year-over-year so they are seeing the same impact from the current market conditions than we are. When I turn to competition, I think there are two big stories this year. One is the rapid transition of dealer to dealer trading, from voice based brokerage to electronic trading, and we see that as our competitors, we also see that quite clearly here with dealers initiating more orders into our open trading platform. So that's been one of the themes this year, as the dealer to dealer business has moved away from some of the traditional voice brokerage firms, it is now very actively deployed on the electronic trading networks, including our own. It's not, it has not been historically been one of our big areas of focus, but open trading is providing an entry point for D2D trading. The second is the growth of portfolio trading, where portfolio trading has grown from something around 2.5% or 3% of trace a year ago to around 5% of trace now. And the processing benefits for portfolios are significant. So given the large number of line items, electronic processing is critical to the effort. It does not today include new forms of liquidity, it is pure C2D trading and we are happy to see progress with clients and dealers utilizing our own portfolio trading solution. And I think those are the two themes this year on the competitive front that I would point out and beyond that, I think market conditions have been part of this story and we're quite confident they will change over time.
Chris Concannon: And Dan, it's Chris. I would just also mention that we do see differences in protocols in different environments, particularly protocols that involve a derived price protocols. And what I mean by that, if you have a price forming market, they suffer in low vol and tight spread environments, where you are deriving price from the market, things like mid-market sessions Low volatility environment, you'll see a gravitation to mid-market sessions or portfolio trading that are using end of the price portfolio trades in a fast market, in a volatile market, those solutions actually will lose market share. So overall we've seen in the past both portfolio trading and mid - mid-market sessions get hurt by volatility. They're actually feeling the benefits of the lack of volatility right now.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on the expenses and kind of spending and understanding the change in guidance reflects more of kind of the current environment, but in terms of the initiatives and the ongoing kind of development that you have internally. Any change in terms of the rate of spend on those kind of growth areas? And as we think about 2022, which I know is still a bit early. Just the context of the environment today and how you're thinking about kind of these new initiatives and the level of spend that's needed to kind of address those?
Chris Gerosa: Yeah. David, this is Chris G. Thank you for the question. We're continuing to work through our 2022 budget and we're going to provide specific guidance on where that will be in the fourth quarter call. But yeah, as we talked about today and we talked about in great detail on the Investor Day back in December, we have a very long list of opportunities ahead of us and we're looking forward to the next 10 years to 15 years. So we are committed to invest in those opportunities and focusing on our trading system enhancements to product and protocol expansion, our geographical footprint expansion. So I don't think the fact that we reduced our 2021 guidance has nothing to do with levering back on those investments. It's all to do with the variable operating expenses and as we look to next year just as a guiderail, I would say that we’re going to expect double digit expense growth consistent with our historical growth rates.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Yeah. Good morning, guys. So I guess my first question has to do with, I guess, follow-up on the expenses. If you did increase headcount, I calculate by, I think, 5% or 6%. And if I back into the expenses and you stated you're going to continue to invest despite the low volatile and slow volume environment. But I am getting like a 17% 18% year-over-year increase in 4Q. I guess is it mainly in headcount or can you give – what's behind this guidance because we can back into what it implies for 4Q?
Rick McVey: Yeah. So year-over-year you need to consider the fact that we do have the additional acquisition costs that we're not embedded in last year. So I think that apples to apples when you strip out the acquisition related cost, you'd see a more normalized rate in that double-digit low-teens range Rich.
Chris Concannon: And Richard, the other thing to add into your formula, which may be complicating things, is our conversion to self-clearing last year and some of the changes we made globally, particularly in Europe, around clearing that scale much better into 2022. So when you think about our clearing costs, our variable costs of trading on open trading we should start reflecting a much better scale of growth of expenses on that side.
Rich Repetto: So next question, Rick, it's really all about, you know, the environment out there. And I don't know what more you can say, you know, to give -- give investors sort of you know either time frame or what's typical here on the turn. But I guess that's one part of the question. The other is this regulatory environment. It doesn't look like it's so much focused on corporate credit, but [indiscernible] talked about a Treasury market review and then you get issues in China, at least on the -- on the brokerage side. And I'd like to hear whether that impacts any of your -- your efforts there in China on the credit side?
Rick McVey: Okay, good. Rich, you managed to take a two question limit and make it a five question topic, which is totally fine, but happy to go through all those. But you know, the short answer on when do the market conditions improve for our business model is, we don't know, of course. But what we've done is we've looked at the last dozen years or so and we pointed out previously we did have similar conditions in 2014 and 2017, and really two quarters was a long time to sit at those low levels of spreads and low levels of credit spread volatility. So we're already beyond that today with the high grade spread index sitting in a 5 basis point range all of 2021 so far. So the history would say that we will see a change. And as I mentioned earlier, the ingredients for volatility are clearly increasing. Certainly, from my perspective, what we're seeing in – in wage pressures does not feel transitory, nor do some of the increases that we're seeing in energy prices. So there certainly our core parts of the inflation story that I think are longer term in nature and you still have the central banks, especially in Europe and here in the US, buying a lot of the net new issuance of government bonds and even mortgages. And in the case of the ECB, some corporate. So I would expect that some of the excess liquidity that we have in the market will start to reverse relatively soon because you still have a lot of quantitative easing going on and you have certainly above trajectory inflation numbers showing up regularly now in the data. So that would be one sign, I think that the market conditions are improving. On the regulatory front, we see that there's continued talk about greater transparency in fixed income markets, which of course we wholeheartedly support. We have no idea why treasury has not moved to increase transparency of the US Treasury market, given that FINRA now collects the data, just as they do for corporate bonds and high yield. So we would be big proponents of increasing transparency in treasuries. We're also continually taking steps to increase transparency in European fixed income, as Chris mentioned earlier, as a byproduct of our growing post-trade reg reporting business. So those are very much attached at the hip, and we think we're providing a valuable service back to our clients to provide those tools to them. Clearly, Chair Gensler has a very busy agenda in front of him. We see topics like crypto and equity market payment for order flow, retail equity trading high on the list. But he does regularly mentioned fixed income transparency and potentially some improvements to the ATS regulatory structure, which we focused on at FinTech. And then I'm trying I'm not sure I perfectly understood the question, but the focus here domestically, of course, is on making sure that public companies that are registered to trade in the US are complying with US accounting and audit rules, which we think makes a lot of sense.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Maybe just on the automation slide and in the prepared remarks, you noted that the responses per inquiry continued to move higher. I guess I'm just -- just wondering, obviously, the environment is pretty benign from a -- from a credit and credit spreads and volatility standpoint. I'm just wondering how much of this kind of increase you think is secular? I'm assuming you think most of it is. And then I guess just wondering if you think there's kind of a tipping point here. Does this get over a certain response rate then all of a sudden customers just feel more comfortable executing and executing in an automated fashion?
Rick McVey: Yeah, three questions. Our automation growth continues. It's really seen quarter over quarter growth rate, particularly in 2021. There are times of volatility where it will grow slower, but it's really based on client adoption and client penetration. And what I mean by that we're really going after the largest investment fund complexes that need automation to solve the multiple tickets and trading that they have on their desk. And so it's really a workflow solution. The increased penetration is really increasing the size that clients are comfortable using a no touch or low touch solution for trading credit and we’re seeing those increase at the client level. So we continue to see growth, that's why it's achieved, close to 20% of our trading activity is now through no touch or low touch automation solutions, and it's now reached 7% of our total volume. We would expect that to continue to grow as clients continue to seek workflow solutions, particularly in a – in RFQ environment. There are benefits to open trading as a result of the adoption of things like auto responder, which is one of our key automation tools that we rolled out. It's allowing clients to actually participate in responses to other clients or other dealers, a request for price. So that’s – it has having an interesting dynamic to the overall liquidity pool.
Kyle Voigt: Got it. Thanks. Second question is just on capital deployment, and so the stocks come back in now a year to date and obviously the operating environment has been challenging. I'm just wondering whether you have any appetite to bump up or increase the repurchase program above the stated objective to offset equity dilution or whether there's no change there?
Chris Concannon: Yeah, this is Christy. Our capital management strategy, the number one priority for us is to invest in the business and the goal of our repurchase program was to offset dilution from employee equity grants. And we have satisfied that during the third quarter, so as we look to what's the number one investment opportunity for us, we continue to believe that to deploy our capital and investing in the business and we'll revisit our repurchase program and connection with our 2022 budget. So no change in our capital management strategy.
Kyle Voigt: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to circle back to the regulatory landscape. I was hoping maybe we could dig in a little bit further on the corporate credit side and just would be interested in your thoughts there and how you see the landscape evolving on the regulatory side and in particular there has been some noise around this Rule 15c2-11 just on I think initially it was supposed to apply to equities at least that was the thinking. And now it seems like it may capture fixed income requirement that may require dealers to ensure information about issuers is updated, but many issuers are private. So I was just curious how much of a challenge do you see that is to fixed income markets? How do you see that playing out and just more broadly, any sort of thoughts on the regulatory landscape?
Rick McVey: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. It's a good question, because there's a lot of industry focus going into 15c2-11 in fixed income right now. And you're absolutely right, this is a 50 year old rule that was originally designed to prevent fraud and in equity OTC markets with retail investors and particularly penny stock show. It's been around for a long time and it's never really applied to fixed income and there was a change in the pronouncement of register -- Federal Register from the SEC recently that said that they viewed fixed income as being included in that 50 year rule and it did come as a surprise because there had not been any staff guidance or really discussion it did come as a surprise because there had not been any step guidance or really discussion about the rule previously and no review today before the change came about. And I think, everybody is trying to sort out exactly what it does mean, and the commission did provide a delay of implementation until early next year, and I know it's under discussion and review with market participants and the commission currently, And there are some antiquated terms in there that nobody quite knows how to define currently, like what exactly is a quotation medium because it does create restrictions for broker dealers in publishing quotes on quotation mediums. So the challenge starts with what exactly is the definition of a quotation medium. From our perspective, we have a variety of protocols and the ones that are most actively used by our clients today, we do not believe would fall subject to the rule. It's not to say that all protocols would be exempt, but we believe that the ones that are used here primarily would be exempt. And the other thing that Market participants have gotten comfortable with is that the majority of corporate bonds probably are not going to create an issue and those are from public companies that are issuing bonds because the fields that broker dealers are required to validate that they have the information for readily available for public companies. Some of the private securities 144as and in regards bonds are still subject to some interpretation, and that's where the area of focus is now. Large market areas like munis and treasuries have been exempted. So I think when all is said and done, we're going to be into a very small sliver of the US market as that could be impacted by the rule and of course, we're hoping They could be impacted by the rule and of course we are hoping that will response to some of the industry concerns about really publishing quotes to promote transparency and in some cases, electronic trading that should be available for all fixed income securities and especially for institutional market participants. So that's what we know about where it stands right now.
Michael Cyprys: Great. Thank you so much for comprehensive response there. Maybe just a follow-up question coming back you know we're seeing this sort of war for talent in the marketplace today. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about how you're adapting around that? Give us maybe a little bit of sense around the retention turnover. Any sort of expectations for growth in headcount over the next couple of years? Clearly, you guys have been growing, but maybe you can give us a sense around where you're hiring from and -- and are you guys a net taker or giver to BigTech?
Rick McVey: Well, I'll start – obviously we are -- if you look at our head count growth rate out investing in talent and investing in particularly tech talent as we grow out our overall footprint and our technology offering, tech talent is by far the hardest to attract and to hold on to. We've had historically very good retention here at MarketAxess. We're quite excited about the retention levels that we have. But the new work from home flexibility is an added curveball to the overall offering of employment. So we have increased our flexibility around where people work to make sure we attract the highest and best tech talent on the market. And that's actually been very helpful in -- in the candidates that we're seeing and the sophisticated talent that we're able to acquire. Across the board, we've seen great success with our graduate program across the board. We've seen great success with our graduate program, so we are hiring directly from colleges across the country and seen some great success with the new players coming in to market over the past few years. So great retention historically, tech talent is quite tight and difficult. I would say some of the companies that have taken a very hard view on working from office has actually opened up our opportunity to acquire talent from whether it's Wall Street firms or the large tech companies.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. I have a follow-up question on the competitive landscape. What are you guys seeing in terms of competition from all the all venues that would serve as an alternative to your open trading?
Rick McVey: Good question, Patrick, and you know, quite honestly, that the – the activity we see away is efficiency gains in direct client to dealer trading primarily and it does not involve much all gold trading in my opinion. So when you look at the growth in D2D activity away from us, it's largely sweeps in session based trading that is pure D2D. I think the exhaust potentially has opportunities to look for liquidity elsewhere. But certainly what shows up on the trace tape is 100% D2D. Portfolio trading is D2D today without really additional participants in the marketplace. So that is a C2D protocol and the newer entrant that is getting some media attention at Trumid. It looks to us like - and again, this is based on the TRACE tape and I think all of you have the opportunity to speak with them directly which of course you should do. But based on the analysis of what's available on the trade to ATS tape. It looks to us like the overall protocol is flat year-over-year and all of the growth is coming from dealer direct. And dealer Direct is in early stages, right? And so when we talk to clients, it's the levels that are strained are not fully executable at those levels. So it almost always involves a negotiation on or off system to get to the point where there is a trade completed. So it's seeded trading with negotiation. According to market participants some of it process, some of it electronic. So when we really think about that seven years of investment that we made to focus on all of our protocols and all of our products and open all to all trading, we believe that our leadership there is significant and that benefit will come through when we see higher levels of volatility and price dispersion just as it did in 2020.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. Thank you. And then want to dig in to the Chinese bond market opportunity a little bit more as well. How are you guys thinking about the TAM of that opportunity and what else has to take place for you guys to really start to meaningfully capture some of that TAM?
Rick McVey: Yeah. Good question. You know if look at the pure China bond Connect volumes, currently, you see the international activity levels at somewhere around $6 billion or $7 billion in turnover per day. Now on the one hand you know that makes it a large local market already with that volume. On the other hand, that's a very small smart part of less than 10% the daily market volume in the Chinese government bond market. And you know our view shared by others is that that international ownership will grow because it's highly likely that the Chinese waiting in the government bond indices around the world will continue to go up in the years ahead. So, those that are measured by government bond, global indices will be increasing their ownership in the Chinese government bond market. So, it's an attractive addition today and in our opinion, it will only grow. Onboarding in OTC markets is time consuming and complicated as always. So, in spite of the fact that we have lots of clients fully integrated to our platform that are ready to trade Chinese government bonds on market access, there is a documentation and onboarding process that we will go through. So, it will probably take us a couple of quarters to get to critical mass, where most of our clients can take advantage of that new offering.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein: Hi, thank you. This is Sherin filling in for Alex. High grade capture rate was down sequentially, and I know you cited some reasons like shorter duration, rising yields and dealer moving from variable to fixed. But can you provide us more color as to which of these three factors played a bigger role for the decline in capture rates? And how should we think of the jumping off point for 4Q?
Rick McVey: Yeah. This is Chris G, the high fee grade capture is -- there's a lot of variable factors that contribute to the month-to-month or year-over-year variability and, as you pointed out, a years to maturity, interest rate environment. The dealer fee plan all of those are main contributors, and those three items are actually what contributed to the year-over-year increase and if you had to prioritize it, the number one factor was the rising interest rate environment. You saw the 10-year treasury spread gap out, which was presented on our side for the market conditions stack. Rick pointed out there was shorter years to maturity. And I referenced in my prepared remarks that we had a number of dealers migrating from a fixed fee plan – from a variable fee plans to a fixed fee plan. And all of that, collectively, it's probably a 40, 30, 30 split on the composition of what was contributing to that $35 a year-over-year decline.
Alex Blostein: Got it. Yeah. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thanks very much for joining us today and we look forward to an update again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 21, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess second quarter 2021 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will discuss automation and product expansion; and then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. Quiet market conditions in global credit markets led to a soft quarter with revenue of $176 million, down 5%. Operating income was $87 million and operating margin was 49%. Diluted EPS of $1.77, down 20% year-over-year. Year-over-year comparisons were challenging when looking at Q2 last year when our revenue was up 47% and EPS was up 73%. However, two-year compound annual growth rates showed strong revenue growth of 19% and operating income growth of 20% this quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, consistent with our long-term growth rates. Market share levels this quarter in high-grade and high-yield were similar to last year. FINRA has also announced that they will revise their historical TRACE market volumes on July 26th to adjust for the rapid increase in double counting for fixed income ATS volume. We will revisit our market share estimates once we see the adjustments from FINRA. We continue to add active clients to our network, and for the quarter, we set new records with 1,840 firms active globally. Emerging markets growth was a highlight for the quarter, with volume up 11% year-over-year, while total EM market volumes were down an estimated 17%. Our estimated EM market share set new highs for the quarter. We are encouraged by the ongoing progress in municipal bond trading, with record volume during the quarter. International clients represented 32% of our global volume in the second quarter, a new record for geographic client diversification. Earlier this week, we announced that Charles Li, the former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has joined the MarketAxess Board of Directors. Charles brings extensive experience in market structure, exchanges and electronic trading and will add important experience to our Board, especially in the Asia region. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Subdued market conditions led to much lower credit market volumes in the second quarter. Institutional investors report lower fixed income trading activity and ETF market participants were much quieter than normal, especially in high-yield. For the quarter, high-grade corporate bond indices were locked in at 8 basis point trading range, following a range of 138 basis points one year ago. TRACE high-grade volume was down 20% and TRACE high-yield volume down 14% versus last year. Fixed income ETF share trading was down 31% in the second quarter versus last year. The lower left chart shows the normal deviations in high-grade and high-yield share gains versus a multi-year linear regression. We have been through quiet trading periods before and fully expect a mean reversion for market volatility and trading volumes. We remain optimistic that the increase in fixed income trading automation and all-to-all trading will lead to an increase in trading velocity. Treasury yields ticked up during the second quarter, but has since moved lower once again. Treasury yields impact corporate bond duration and also our high-grade fee capture. Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Our unique Open Trading liquidity pool continues to drive important transaction cost savings to our clients, in spite of the low volatility environment. Clients saved an estimated $127 million in transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements in Open Trading. The vast majority of investor and dealer initiated orders on MarketAxess are available in one single liquidity pool. On average, our network delivered 29,000 orders per day and over $15 billion in notional value into the Open Trading central marketplace. We believe that our unique global institutional network with over 1,800 active firms in Open Trading increases trading opportunities, reduces transaction costs and reduces market risk during high volatility periods. Our dealer initiated Open Trading volume was up 28% year-over-year. Dealers are finding great value in both making markets and taking liquidity on the MarketAxess system. The D2D client segment is moving rapidly to embrace electronic trading solutions. We are also pleased with the early success in our Diversity Dealer Initiative. We have now onboarded 12 minority and women-owned dealers for the new program and diversity dealer volume with investors is up 90% year-over-year in early days. This is a great example of using Open Trading to expand the important trading relationships for investors and dealers. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on new products and trading automation.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Rick. Slide 6 provides an update on our investment in new products and protocols. We recently announced enhancements to our portfolio trading solution, including integrating - integrated net spotting and hedging capabilities, supported through the MarketAxess Rates platform. Since the technology release in late May, more than 95 portfolio trades have been completed on MarketAxess with 27 unique investor firms and 10 dealers. While portfolio trading makes up a small portion of the market, somewhere between 4% and 5% of trades, we are committed to further enhancing our portfolio trading solution. Our Mid-X sessions protocol was launched in the fall of 2020 and has seen significant adoption. $2.5 billion in Eurobond volume was traded through Mid-X in the second quarter, up 79% from the prior quarter. We expect to extend Mid-X to U.S. credit products in the second half of this year. Shifting focus to new product areas, municipal bond trading on MarketAxess grew to a record $6.8 billion in the quarter. Also within the quarter, we announced the completed acquisition of MuniBrokers, which transacts approximately $330 million in municipal bond volume per day, which is currently not included in our muni bond volume totals. Our MarketAxess Rates offering is expanding beyond our initial Click-to-Trade solution with RFQ being launched this month and our all-to-all Open Trading functionality for treasuries launching later this year. We continue to deliver our clients with a choice of trading protocols across the full breadth of fixed income products, supported by a combination of dealer and all-to-all liquidity. Slide 7 demonstrates our continued momentum of automation in credit trading. Automated trading on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter growing to $41.5 billion in volume and over 218,000 trades. 98 firms leveraged our automated trading protocols in the quarter, up from 86 the year prior. Today Auto-X represents 17% of total trade count and 6% of our total volume. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.6 million algo responses in the second quarter, up 30% from the same period last year. We've also seen continued adoption of our Auto Responder functionality. Auto Responder allows client firms to automatically respond with liquidity based on a set of pre-defined criteria. This functionality is a critical step in helping clients avoid the cost of regularly crossing this breadth. Slide 8 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were down 22% year-over-year to $324 billion for the quarter, largely due to significant decline in market volumes and benign market conditions in the second quarter. Estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE market volumes were down 15% year-over-year. Volumes in our other credit category were up 5% year-over-year to $345 billion for the quarter. Our trading volume in emerging market bonds and Eurobonds outpaced the change in estimated market volumes. Similar to U.S. high-grade, the most significant factor weighing on the decline in our U.S. high-yield trading volume was the double-digit decline in estimated market volumes. Our green bond trading initiative continues to support clients' ESG-related investment mandates. In the second quarter, over $13 billion worth of green bonds were traded on our platform, resulting in over 65,000 trees being planted. We have now planted over 131,000 trees since the beginning of the year, which nearly surpasses our 2020 full year record. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was $176 million, down 5% year-over-year. Commissions were 9% lower, resulting from the 10% decline in credit trading volume. Post-trade services revenue more than doubled to $9.8 million and reflects $3.8 million of trade reporting revenue from clients added through the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition and healthy organic growth driven by new clients and new services. The information services revenue was up 17% year-over-year, principally due to recurring data sales. The weaker dollar favorably impacted both post-trade and information services revenue each by around $600,000. Operating income was $87 million, down 16% year-over-year and operating margin was 49.4% in the second quarter. If we excluded the impact of the acquisition-related intangible amortization expense and non-recurring integration costs, operating margin would have been 52%. Despite weaker market volumes and difficult market conditions, we continue to add personnel and invest in organic and inorganic initiatives. The effective tax rate was 21.4% on a year-to-date basis. We expect the effective tax rate to vary quarter-to-quarter in the second half of the year and are maintaining our full year effective tax rate guidance of 22% to 24%. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. On a composite basis, the majority of the 13% decrease in credit transaction fees were driven by a decline in estimated market volumes. Lower rates transaction fees was due principally to a decline in estimated U.S. Treasury market volumes. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down around 4% on both sequential and year-over-year basis. We didn't make any fee plan changes during the quarter and the sequential decrease was due to variety of factors, including slightly lower duration. Our other credit category fee per million of $194 was lower than both the first quarter 2021 and second quarter 2020 levels, due principally to the impact of a change in product mix and shift in protocols. During the second quarter, there was a heavier weighting to emerging markets in Eurobond volume and a lighter weighting to high-yield volume. The increase in other credit distribution fees was principally due to the inclusion of MuniBrokers subscription and license fees of $1.1 million. In the near-term, we expect the subscription and license fees will run around $1.3 million per quarter. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Second quarter expenses were up 11% year-over-year. Excluding the $5.1 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and non-recurring integration costs related to the Regulatory Reporting Hub and MuniBrokers businesses, expenses were up 4% year-over-year. Sequentially, expenses were down 3.1%. Approximately half of the decline in compensation and benefits was due to lower variable incentive pay, which is tied directly to operating performance and the residual was due to lower employer taxes, which are always seasonally higher in the first quarter. Pure salary expense was up almost $1 million versus the first quarter as we continued to execute against our hiring plan. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the amortization of acquired intangibles on the MuniBrokers transaction. Marketing and advertising costs can swing period-to-period and the second quarter reflects a more active level of advertising campaigns and return of some T&E expense. We are at the mid-year mark and are now expecting that full year expenses may end up at the low end of our expense guidance range of $370 million to $386 million. On Slide 12, we provide cash flow and capital management information. Cash and investments as of June 30th were $440 million and trailing 12 months free cash flow was $320 million. During the second quarter, we paid out the quarterly cash dividend of $25 million and repurchased a total of 49,000 shares at a cost of $20 million through a combination of net-down and option exercise and restricted stock vesting activity and our share buyback program. We didn't borrow against the $500 million syndicated revolving credit facility or the $200 million secured facility used to facilitate Open Trading settlement activity in the second quarter. Based on the second quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity in front of us. In the short run, growth rates will always be impacted by market conditions. Long-term, we continue to deliver attractive revenue and earnings growth and see a large and growing opportunity set for our business. Our investments are paying off with a growing international business, accelerating share momentum in emerging markets and promising new products and protocols. Let me close the prepared remarks with a sincere thank you to Tony DeLise. Tony has done an outstanding job as MarketAxess' CFO over the last 11 years. He has been a terrific business partner and an essential part of our senior team, always operating with integrity and transparency. Tony has passed the CFO baton on to Chris Gerosa, our former Head of Finance. Tony will remain with the company and focus on corporate development, capital management and Investor Relations. Well done Tony on a great run as MarketAxess' CFO. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rich Repetto: I guess, Rick, the first question is market conditions dramatically changed from the same quarter last year and - but we have seen a little bit of volatility at least in the overall markets and I think some slight volatility upticks in the credit markets in July. Can you give us any feel for how - whether you're seeing the same sort of movement back in a more environment - more friendly to market access?
Rick McVey: Sure. And happy to take that question. This - just the last three or four days, Rich, we've seen some better volatility and it has come through in our volumes and especially in high yield share. It's a little bit weird, which is why we really didn't comment on it because at the midway mark in July, the first half has the 4th of July holiday weekend with very low volumes on the short trading day on July 2nd. So, it's - with eight trading days left, we got to think the best of the month is yet to come. But you're absolutely right. If you look at just the last three or four trading days with even some signs of volatility coming back, it has been beneficial for our business. And the place where it's most noticeable is obviously that ETF community gets engaged in our high-yield product, in particular, when there is volatility in high-yield spreads, which we have seen more recently. So, who knows whether it lasts or not, but at least some positive signs on the volatility front.
Rich Repetto: Understood. That's helpful, Rick. And then, I guess, when we think about MarketAxess, we think about the Open Trading in the all-to-all network. And the acquisitions that you've done both with LiquidityEdge and MuniBrokers. I guess, Chris, can you talk about - and you did mention that you're going to take RFQ and Open Trading, I believe, into the treasury market. And I think longer-term, maybe into the muni market as well. I guess, what gives you confidence that, I guess - how does it fit? How do you think it will fit this new protocol in markets that haven't been accustomed to it?
Chris Concannon: Well, great question, Rich. And I do have to mention that I saw you running in Sag Harbor. And I think our volumes are growing faster than your pace, I noticed. But on Open Trading, as we think about Open Trading, we want Open Trading to really penetrate across all markets. We think it's a unique offering. It brings alternative liquidity into those markets. It has a network effect of liquidity. It also allows clients to participate and avoid spread crossing and be liquidity providers when the moment is opportune for them. So, Open Trading across all products is a key part of our strategy long-term. In munis, we see Open Trading as a sizable portion of the market. Open Trading is about 45% of the volume in the muni market. So, it's actually an important component to the muni market and that network effect. Obviously, the acquisition of MuniBrokers, we intend to populate our Open Trading content with MuniBrokers data. So, the linkage with MuniBrokers will come through Open Trading as well, again, leveraging that Open Trading solution. In the rates market, it's a really unique opportunity that we see, and one that actually the Fed sees as well and recently published a report, a study on last year's challenges in the treasury market. So, our strategy is to deploy our Open Trading solution in the treasury market. We plan to deliver that before year-end and have a very nice plan around, not only RFQ, but Open Trading as well. And another key attribute of our Open Trading solution will be across the full breadth of treasury products, both on the run and off the run, which allows a unique product offering in treasuries that we don't see in the market today. So, all of that's coming. And as I mentioned, Open Trading in things like Eurobonds, EM continues to see sizable growth, even in a more challenging quarter that we just witnessed.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Why do you think that MarketAxess's U.S. credit market share seems to be more impacted by market volatility, more so than your competitors?
Rick McVey: Yes, happy to take that one, Patrick. And I do think that different protocols work best in different environments. And you saw us try during the high volatility period a year ago when price dispersion in credit was much higher than it is currently. As a result, the additive liquidity of Open Trading and the price improvement from Open Trading was very significant to market participants and drove volumes and share through our platform. In an environment like this, where there is very limited volatility, there is less price dispersion. What we are hearing from institutional investors right now is there's actually a shortage of bonds because there is so much liquidity in the system as low as our rates are, rates are even lower elsewhere in the world. So, asset managers are getting inflows and that increases the focus on the new issue calendar and drive some business back at the margin to dealers. The other point that I made earlier, Patrick, that you're well aware of is we have introduced a lot of new market participants to credit trading through Open Trading. The ETF, our community is very active when vol is high and much less active with vol at low levels as they have been recently. And when you look at our high-yield share difference, it's almost entirely driven by the swing in ETF market participants, not because they've gone anywhere else or they don't want to trade, it's just that the arbitrage opportunity has been much less. And as a result, their levels and their share of TRACE are down significantly. And I do continue to believe, as Chris mentioned, that our Open Trading solution is differentiated. It will do well when volatility is high. A lot of the success that you see away from us is really dealer directed protocols. We're really pleased with our most recent release on portfolio trading. We wouldn't admit that we were behind there, but we think we have closed the gap. It's very early days in electronic trading and portfolio trading, and portfolio trading, in general, we're getting great encouragement from investors and dealers to keep going because none of the solutions in the market are perfect. But that was one of the share gaps that we had that we're working very hard to close and have a series of releases and enhancements coming up, and I think one to watch there. And then finally, D2D trading has not really been a strength of MarketAxess. We focus on the 75% or 80% of the market that's driven by institutional investors. So, as dealers have embraced electronic solutions, some of our competitors that have dealer-to-dealer businesses and voice brokers are benefiting from that transition in the short run slightly more than we are, but we're encouraged that we're participating in it through dealer RFQ into Open Trading. So, I think it's a variety of factors, but I'm quite confident that the advantages of Open Trading come through longer-term and when we get back to more normal levels of volatility.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then you spoke about a lot of the new initiatives that you have underway, whether it's portfolio trading or live markets or Mid-X. What's the nature of your clients sales efforts these days? Are some of your clients starting to get back in the office and you're doing in-person meetings and walking them through these new protocols or how are your client sales efforts taking place right now?
Chris Concannon: Good question. We have actually been seeing clients outside the office for many months now. So, as things opened up in Europe and in the U.S., client engagement outside the office became a regular technique of our sales team. Virtual sales is also quite effective, particularly when you're launching things like automation, products that need demos and sampling of data. And so, our sales force has really stepped up and - during the pandemic and throughout the last few months in selling virtually and doing demos, things like portfolio trading demos and live market demos. And if you look at the numbers across our various products from muni bonds, to EM, to Eurobonds, sizable growth year-over-year to what was a very difficult comp last year. So, we feel quite comfortable in the virtual arena, but we have actually started to see clients outside their offices and still not engaging clients in their offices and we expect that to continue throughout 2021.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dan Fannon: Tony, I wanted to follow-up on your comments around low end of the guidance kind of where you're tracking today. And maybe if you could give us some sense of what that means for the revenue environment with the backdrop as you think about the back half of the year in terms of the industry volumes?
Tony DeLise: No, sure. Happy to do that, Dan. And looking at the full year forecast right now, there are some variables in that forecast. One of them is around people and we ended the quarter with right around 640 people. We expect to add and have a clear line of sight on adding another 40 people, albeit 25 of those are our college grad program. But another big swing factor has to do with variable compensation, a lot of that is tied to operating performance. And at least right now, what we've got built into the model is more of a continuation of what we saw on the first half of the year, which are fairly muted market volumes and fairly muted market conditions. So, that variable compensation can swing up or down, depending on operating performance. The other piece of the expense is that that does fluctuate and again tied to market volumes and market conditions will be around clearing expenses. And you saw the savings that came through this year, largely as a result of our self-clearing transition activities in the U.K. and our settlement agent transition activities - I'm sorry, in the U.S. and then the settlement agent transition in the U.K. But depending on market conditions and market volumes, those clearing costs can swing up or down as well. So, hard to predict, but right now, we're assuming a continuation of what we've seen in the first half of the year.
Dan Fannon: And then just thinking about the opportunity with post-trade, as you kind of integrate the acquisition as well as the other kind of non-transactional revenue line items, just kind of hoping to get a bit of an outlook here for the remainder of the year for those segments as well.
Tony DeLise: Yes. Dan, happy to do that. And really the non-transaction will be around post-trade and on the information services side. And in the first half of the year on post-trade, you did see a big pickup because of the integration of the Regulatory Reporting Hub business. It's about $8 million in revenue in the first half of the year. It's more than meeting our expectations in terms of revenue contribution. We've also seen a pretty big increase in organic revenue. We have new services in the past 12 months around SFTR reporting and repo matching. There's new client additions as a couple of firms have exited the transaction reporting market. When we look at back half of the year for post-trade, pretty good proxy would be what you see in the first half of the year. And what that would translate to would be 30%-plus growth on the organic side and then overlay the Reg Reporting Hub side. So, the back half of the year is similar. Although, I will tell you something in post-trade it is - our transaction reporting revenue is somewhat tied to volume, so there is - there are tiered volume plans, so volume does matter, but use of first half is a pretty good proxy there. On the information services side, you look at the first half of the year and revenue was up about 11%. The really good underlying news there, when you look at recurring revenue, it was up around 19%. So, any given quarter, we may have some one-time one-off sales. They were much bigger in 2020 than what we're seeing here in 2021. So, when you really carve into the information services revenue, 19% growth year-over-year in recurring revenue. Guidance for the rest of the year, if you look back sort of historically and we've talked about this in the past, we've grown information services revenue at low double-digits. We've got a pretty decent pipeline of opportunities looking into the second half of the year. And we're looking at sort of forecast around that, we're looking at double-digit growth year-over-year on the information services side. So, a continuation of what you saw in the first half.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Maybe my first question on portfolio trading. As you alluded to earlier, it's a protocol that maybe you hadn't invested in as much as peers historically. Rick, I'm curious to hear your updated thoughts on the role that portfolio trading will play in the long-term electronification of the credit market? And maybe how this compares to your thoughts just a few years ago?
Rick McVey: Yes. I'm happy to. I think it's a new tool in risk transfer that has value in certain situations for both investors and dealers. As Chris mentioned, we think it's around 4% of TRACE volume now, that's up from probably 2.5% or so a year ago. We do believe in situational, right. So, I don't think you're going to see this become something more than 8% or 10% of the market over time, but there are good results in certain situations and certain kind of basket trades that investors are reporting. So, it's really important for us to continue our work around enhancing the protocols for clients. And as I mentioned, we're off to a really good start. You do see some indexation balancing going on in portfolios currently. You see some tax trades going on and tax swaps going on. They usually go to somewhere between one and three dealers right now, so this is part of the dealer directed business that I talked about earlier. So, it's all part of the - what I think is the transformation of the market making model and risk transfer model. This is a new tool in the shed that investors and dealers are using, and we're really pleased to be now part of that ecosystem and expect to invest even more heavily in the future. I will also say that the use of portfolio trading will ebb and flow with volatility. It's much easier to conduct basket trades when volatility is low. And that, again, if you look at the second quarter of last year with pricing moving around as much as it was, it's more difficult to do basket trades that require more time in constructing the basket and negotiating the price for the basket. And I will also say, when I look at what we're doing and others, it's trade assist and trade processing. The STP benefits in my mind are the key piece because of the number of transactions. It's - today, it's a pure client to a limited number of dealers protocol. So, it's not a liquidity solution currently, but that is subject to change too as people think about different ways that they might execute portfolio trades down the road.
Chris Concannon: And one thing I'll add is, we made a very strategic decision to focus on Diversity Dealer Initiative, something that is unique to MarketAxess and quite powerful in the current environment. And we're seeing high demand from clients to execute with our Diversity Dealer Initiative. Portfolio trading has natural limits to it in a marketplace like the fixed income market, both from the liquidity provision side and risk transfer, as well as from the client side. And part of our enhancements to portfolio trading is to make sure clients understand the value of trading as a portfolio versus the value as trading in the individual line item less. We offer both solutions, both portfolio, all or none offerings as well as lists. And the pricing dynamic can change, as Rick mentioned, from quarter-to-quarter. So, while it is a sizable portion of the market at 4% or 5%, we do think it has growth limits to it and will change as a percentage during certain market environments.
Kyle Voigt: That's great. Thank you. And my follow-up would actually be on Mid-X. Looks like it's about 3%, I think, of your Eurobond volume already. I think it was just launched less than a year ago, so a pretty good success thus far. But I guess when you think about the rollout to U.S. corporates, I recall the liquidity characteristics of the U.S. high-grade market being pretty similar to the Eurobond market. But just wondering, if there's anything you can point to that would really lead you to believe that the U.S. rollout would see more or less uptake than what you saw with the Eurobond launch?
Chris Concannon: Well, yeah, we're - as I mentioned in my remarks, we plan on rolling out Mid-X to U.S. corporates. We are excited about the success in Europe and we do see similarities in demand in the U.S. It is much more demand from dealers than clients, it's really a dealer-to-dealer solution. And many times, you'll see a sessions trade come off of a portfolio trade. So, some of those bonds that are trading in portfolios that dealers don't want in inventory will find their way into a Mid-X session trade as well. So, we do see sizable matches happening in our Eurobond Mid-X solution and we would expect similar and maybe even larger sizes matching in our Mid-X solution as it rolls out in U.S. corporates. But we do see client demand, we do see dealer demand and we're really seeing huge growth in our dealer RFQ solution. This would be another really dealer-to-dealer offering in the U.S.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chris Allen: Maybe if you could just touch on emerging markets a little bit, maybe give us an update in terms of where you're seeing strength from a regional perspective where there is penetration opportunities? I mean, is there any change to the competitive landscape from an electronic trading perspective?
Rick McVey: Yes.
Chris Concannon: Yes.
Rick McVey: It was hard - it was a little bit hard to hear you, Chris. But I think the question was about the EM competitive landscape.
Chris Concannon: And growth where you're seeing?
Rick McVey: So, yeah. So, on the competitive landscape, it's primarily internationally with Bloomberg because of their desktop presence and we are quickly adding new clients in APAC, CEEMEA and Latin America. So, we're onboarding clients and we think we have a superior electronic trading and liquidity solution that we're promoting around the world. And then - so we're really excited about the market share gains and the momentum that we have on volume and, importantly, the active clients that we see internationally. And there is so much runway left there because it's not just one market, we're trading hard currency, EM bonds in all regions. But importantly, we're trading EM bonds in 26 local markets and local currencies too. So, there is a massive long-term opportunity there and the progress that we made in the first half of the year is coming in both hard currency in local markets and it's coming in all regions. So, this has really held up the international business results in the first half of the year, even though EM markets in general are suffering from the same lack of volatility that you see in U.S. credit markets. So, space to watch. We're really excited about the size of the opportunity and the growing competitive position and market share that we have in EM. We've got so much more to do. APAC is - not only is the underlying market growing very quickly, but our own volume and client base and market share is growing quite actively too.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Alex Blostein: I was hoping to take a little bit of a step back and maybe thinking across the U.S. IG landscape. And thinking between MarketAxess and other platforms, it looks like the percentage of electronically traded is pushing something in the 40%-ish range, give or take, at least in the last couple of months. So, can you update us on your latest thoughts about sort of the ultimate penetration opportunity for electronic platforms here? 70, 80, 100, kind of how do you guys think about that? What does the growth path looks like to get you there, i.e., like what are the key kind of customer pain points that you think you need to solve to drive that share higher? And then, I guess, secondly, along sort of same lines of question, but what do you guys think it will take to see actually higher turnover in IG space? It feels like that's been - again, other than periods of like elevated volatility has been pretty muted.
Rick McVey: Yes. Happy to take a first shot at that, Alex. Thank you for the question. But the first disclaimer is that the estimates you see are just that they are estimates provided by venues that have wildly different reporting standards. So, I think there are some analysts that are trying to parse through all the reporting differences to get through the differences around double counting, fully electronic versus electronic processed and then segment reporting across C2D, D2D and even all-to-all. So, there are very different standards and it's really hard to get to an accurate answer on what the share is today because of those differences. This is something that FIMSAC took up as a recommendation that we should have standards, so that it's easier for people to follow the share trends in electronic trading, which I believe had something to do with FINRA, at least addressing some of the double counting issues that you're aware of that have been showing up in ATS that are probably part of that 40% number that you are citing. But having said that, I do think that we're going to see the benefits in higher share of electronic trading. And for investment grade, I don't see any reason why we wouldn't be thinking 60%, 70% of the market down the road and an increase in velocity. And every other market, when you have central marketplaces like ours that are connecting all participants in one central liquidity pool and growing use of trading automation that's reducing trading costs, you do get an increase in velocity. And absent the second quarter, we've been on a really nice uptrend over the last four or five quarters on trading velocity. And that's actually probably the bigger opportunity because velocity came down following bank regulatory reform and the constraints on bank trading and balance sheets. It's now starting to go back up because the dealers have transformed their market making models. They're getting in the middle of more trades than ever before. Investors are using automated tools like Auto-X and Auto-R more regularly too. So, when we think out five, 10 years, Alex, the share gains are part of the story, but velocity is an equal or potentially even greater part of the story if you look at what has happened to velocity in other asset classes when automation takes hold away, it looks like it's starting to in credit.
Alex Blostein: And then maybe a specific question. I was hoping you guys could update us on LiquidityEdge and specifically with respect to net spotting and what you're working through there. I jumped on the call a little bit later, I'm not sure if there was an update on that. But curious, how that initiative is going? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Sure, Alex. I'll take that one. So, our Rates offering is live and our Click-to-Trade solution has been rolled out and is growing. We're now over 200 clients. With regard to how our Rates integration with our credit trading, high-grade trading, we do have net spotting already on the platform. Clients are feeling the benefits of that as a result of the integrated price from the Rates platform, it's a slightly tighter price than we're seeing on other platforms. Our net hedging is fully live. It's in production and rolling out client-by-client. We have just over 13 dealers providing liquidity with a number of dealers in the queue to support that auto hedging as well, which helps the dealers on the platform. Auto hedging is also rolled out. We have close to 17 dealers live and benefiting from auto hedging. So, the integration of our Rates platform and our credit trading platform has really gotten to full production and we're quite comfortable with that. As I mentioned in our remarks, our Click-to-Trade solution is out and rolling out to clients, but we're more excited about the opportunity around RFQ and Open Trading, which is coming here shortly. Open Trading, in particular, across the full breadth of the treasury product group, which will be out before year-end. And that's really a unique offering that we don't see any other competitor offering in the treasury space, where both dealer liquidity and alternative dealer liquidity can be found in one place in response to large RFQs across both on the run and off the run. So, really excited about 2021 and the treasury space here in the U.S.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sean Horgan with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sean Horgan: So, the first question is just on capital allocation. I think buybacks were a little more aggressive in the second quarter. Should we expect that to continue through the back half of this year?
Tony DeLise: So, Sean, on the sort of the capital management programs we have in place, we've got the two programs. We have our recurring dividend in place, where we're targeting paying out about one-third of our earnings and free cash flow. And then we have the share buybacks. And really, we use share buybacks to offset dilution from equity grants. On those share repurchases, they come in two forms. We've got buybacks under Board approved or Board authorized plans. And then we've got net-downs on restricted stock vesting and some of the stock option exercises. And we use those repurchases in the aggregate to offset dilution and they do vary from quarter-to-quarter. But when you look at the buyback plans, it does vary, it's dependent on the grid in place, it's dependent on our share price. But you're correct, just looking at the buyback plans, repurchases were higher in Q2 than the first quarter. But we're going to continue to maintain that philosophy of using repurchases to offset dilution. That's why the diluted share count hasn't really varied in the last seven years. So, right now, and this is both dividends and repurchases, no plans to change our capital return programs. We revisit the conversation with the Board every quarter. But today, we feel like we have the right balance in place.
Sean Horgan: And the second question, I know marketing was a little more aggressive this quarter. I'm just wondering, if that's more regular seasonality or if this is more of a focused effort? And if so, what are you spending on and how are you measuring the success of those investments?
Tony DeLise: So, on the marketing, Sean, it does vary from period-to-period and it's dependent on advertising campaigns, client events, conferences, trade shows. Last 16 months has been impacted by the pandemic and in the near-term around the T&E spend. When you look at the second quarter, a little bit of an uplift and it's again - tends to be episodic, but a little bit of an uplift around some advertising campaigns and a little bit of a resumption of T&E. If you're thinking about the second half of the year, we would expect that run rate to look similar to the second quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Patrick, your phone might be on mute.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Thanks for taking my follow-up. We're starting to see some additional use cases for distributed ledger technology. I think we're starting to see some repo trades. I want to say there's at least one entity trying to develop a distributed ledger solution for bond trading. What do you guys see is the opportunity there? Is it an opportunity? Is it a threat? Is it even going to be relevant? And I think maybe, in particular, leveraged loans, the settlement process there is very lengthy and complicated and maybe there is a use case for distributed ledger in loans.
Chris Concannon: Patrick, we've been watching distributed ledger technology for a number of years now and following it closely. As you mentioned, there are probably appropriate places for distributed ledger to offer efficiencies in settlement. The key piece of the products that we trade are centrally cleared. And so, when you move into a centrally cleared market, distributed ledger can only thrive if it comes with a central guarantee of a clearinghouse. Those are the - some of the key benefits of clearinghouse efficiencies. And so, as distributed ledger steps into securitized products, there are some limited areas where they do provide efficiencies. But unless they come with that guarantee settlement and the netting benefit of the guaranteed settlement, it becomes challenging to see the full efficiency of distributed ledger. Real-time settlement in liquid securities is not what everyone's racing towards because of the turnover - can impact turnover in the market, given the centralized clearing efficiency. So, distributed ledger is watch. We see it in a couple of instruments where it maybe more efficient. It may actually be interesting in new issue markets, where it's much quicker to bring a securitized product to market. So, there is a number of applications that we see it entering, but obviously we trade highly liquid centrally cleared product. And right now, we don't see distributed ledger stepping into that, but we will continue to watch it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael Cyprys: And thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you would talk a little bit about the opportunity that you see on the index side, specifically around creating new fixed income indices. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of your initiatives there, some of the actions you're taking and what we might see over the next couple of years from MarketAxess on that front?
Chris Concannon: A great area, a great topic. We are following indexation in the fixed income market quite closely. Obviously, many of our clients offer index-related products, either managed or in the ETF form. We do think there's an exciting future in indexation in fixed income. We look at the market and the indices that are in the market, and they were not originally designed for what I'd call highly liquid tradable products. So, we think there's a new opportunity in indices across the fixed income market globally to start offering highly liquid index products. We currently have several indices that we have published and are providing to the market. You can see them on our website, but we do think there is a great opportunity in the - a further indexation of the market. We also see custom baskets growing in the market and custom indices that clients are in demand for. So, some unique opportunities across the index landscape in fixed income. And I will tell you, I think it's very early days when we look at some of the indexation in other asset classes, particularly equities. So, we're excited about the benefits of indexation, not only for the overall market and our clients, but also the benefits for our competitive landscape. We thrive in ETF volume. So, as fixed income products make their way into index-based ETFs, we see our business thriving. And this quarter is an example of where ETF trading volume was down and that certainly impacted our competitive position. But very excited about the future of indexation, excited about our role in indexation in the future and looking forward to new products being launched in the coming months and years.
Michael Cyprys: And just maybe a quick follow-up question on our emerging markets, certainly an area of strength for you guys in the quarter. You mentioned a lot of momentum there. I was just hoping if you could talk a little bit about some of the initiatives that you have in your EM business, where you see the biggest opportunity, are there byproducts, I know sovereign has been a big area, but what about the opportunity set on the corporate side and then in terms of geographic regions within EM?
Rick McVey: Yes, it's really all the above, Michael. We have both Open Trading and dealer RFQ at work in EM. We have been active in all 26 of the local markets and we've been adding sales resources in all the regions that I mentioned, in Latin Americas, CEEMEA and APAC to onboard more clients. The local market opportunity we think is enormous. Typically, you see 75% or 80% of the local markets traded by local participants, and our sales effort is paying dividends there with more clients and dealers being onboarded. And as I mentioned, the APAC region is especially attractive to us, given the growth in debt in the APAC region and we certainly hope to be able to compete and participate and utilize our network to help open up the Chinese markets before too long as well. So, couldn't be more excited about that opportunity and in fact that we've been making investments in the EM space for nearly 20 years now. And we think that there is a real acceleration going on in e-trading adoption around the world.
Chris Concannon: And I would just add, in EM, we're seeing healthy growth, not only in our market and market volumes in EM, but our data product, our CP+ offering. EM is a difficult market, given it's not a very transparent market. So, any help to both professional traders as well as clients for a strong data feed helps drive our overall offering. We're seeing growth in automation as a result of that data and adoption in our automated tools in EM. We are now offering portfolio trading in EM as well. So, just a lot of healthy opportunity in EM from both Open Trading, automation and all of our protocols, but really being driven by some of the valuable product offering we have in data.
Rick McVey: It looks like that ends the Q&A. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on business trends next quarter.
Operator: And I'm showing that we have no further questions at this time and I would like to turn the conference back over to Rick McVey for any further remarks.
End of Q&A:
Rick McVey: I think I already closed the call, but thanks for joining us. We'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded on April 22nd, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead sir. 
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter; Chris Concannon, President and COO will discuss automation and product expansion; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2020. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick. 
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. First quarter revenue reached a new quarterly record of $195 million, up 16%; operating income of $103 million was up 14%; and EPS of $2.11 was up 8%. Record revenue was driven primarily by market share gains in our core credit products. New quarterly volume records were set for total credit trading volume as well as new volume records for high-yield trading, emerging markets, Eurobonds, and municipal bonds. Open trading volumes grew 20% year-over-year and estimated transaction cost savings delivered to our clients were $197 million. International client volume was up 18% and reached a new record of $237 billion. It is important to remember that in Q1 last year, we had five full weeks of elevated credit market activity due to the onset of the pandemic. In light of the significant difference in market conditions this year, we feel very good about the volume, revenue, and earnings growth this quarter. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. The top left chart displays just how different the market environment was one year ago. Our business thrives when credit spread volatility increases. During Q1 last year, credit spread volatility was 10 times greater than this year and credit spreads in high-grade were nearly 200 basis points wider. New issue activity was strong during the quarter and similar to last year. TRACE volumes in high-grade were up 7% in Q1 reflecting a continuing trend toward higher secondary market turnover. Average years to maturity for investment-grade bonds traded on the system continues to climb and reach the high end of the historical range at 10 years this quarter. Slide five provides an update on Open Trading. Our market-leading all-to-all marketplace Open Trading set new records this quarter with an average of 34,000 orders per day totaling over $19 billion in notional value per day in credit products. High grade, high-yield, and emerging markets all show healthy open trading volume increases in excess of 20%. Dealer initiated open-trading orders were up 78% year-over-year. Our D2D business now represents 8% of our credit trading volume and 7% of credit trading revenue as we compete effectively in this client segment with more traditional D2D competitors through open trading. This quarter, two-thirds of our system-wide open orders traded with a traditional dealer counterparty, while one-third found price improvement in Open Trading. Open Trading ADV reached a new record of $4 billion per day, up 22% year-over-year. For the fifth quarter in a row, estimated transaction cost savings of $197 million delivered to our clients were in excess of total company credit trading revenue. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris, to provide an update on product and client expansion.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick. Slide 6 highlights our international growth and product expansion. Throughout the past year, we have remained focused on bolstering our global footprint and expanding our product offerings. I will touch on a few of these initiatives today. Our international growth continues with an 18% year-over-year increase in international client volumes, driven by over 900 active clients across our global products. In the first quarter, US credit volume from international clients was up 23%. Emerging markets volume increased by 22% and Eurobond volumes increased by 13%. Our ongoing investment in Asia Pacific region delivered an increase in the number of clients and significant gains in volume. Client credit volume from the region grew to $29 billion, up 57% from the first quarter of 2020, as the number of clients in the region also grew by 14% over the past year. We are encouraged by the progress we are making outside the US and we believe, we are well positioned to capture a larger share of trading in the growing global credit markets. In the area of product expansion, we continue to see momentum in our municipal bond offering. In the first quarter, we again hit record volumes with a total of $5.8 billion in municipal bond volumes, up 75% from a year ago. We also released -- recently closed on the acquisition of MuniBrokers, a central electronic venue, serving large banks and inter-dealer brokers in the municipal bond market. The acquisition expands our connectivity with dealers and provides rich content for our growing Muni client business. Our post-trade business, an important contributor to our data strategy, continues to grow with organic post-trade revenue up 50% in the first quarter, driven largely by new client additions and our SFTR offering. We now have over 950 unique post-trade clients. The integration of our recently acquired Regulatory Reporting Hub is well underway and is extending our leading regulatory reporting business across Europe, while further strengthening our data capabilities and our post-trade services. Slide 7 demonstrates our continued momentum of automation in Credit Trading. Automated trading and dealers automated responses continue to grow across the platform. Automated trading volumes rose to $39 billion in the first quarter, up from $31 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Auto-X trade count also grew in the quarter to 205,000, up 37% from the prior year. 95 firms utilized our Auto-X functionality in the quarter, up from 84 in Q1 of last year, while 22 firms used our Auto-Responder functionality. We are also seeing healthy adoption of Auto-X across investment grade, Eurobonds, high-yield and emerging markets. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform, with approximately 4.8 million algo responses in the first quarter, up 57% from the same period last year. The growth in the average number of responses per inquiry has resumed, following a decline in the first half of last year. The increasing responses, ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform. As the overall share of electronic trading grows in global credit, we are seeing continued demand for and growth in our automated trading solutions. We are continuing to develop innovative automated trading solutions in collaboration with our buy and sell-side clients and I look forward to sharing updates to our offering in the coming quarters. Slide 8, provides a summary of our trade environment across product categories. Our US high-grade volumes were up 10% year-over-year to $363 billion for the quarter, largely due to an increase in market volumes and market share gains. Estimated US high-grade market volumes were up 7%, while estimated share increased -- market share increased by 0.5 percentage point’s year-over-year to 20.5%. Volumes in our other credit category were up 19% year-over-year to $391 billion for the quarter and we achieved record quarterly trading volume in high yield emerging markets, Eurobonds and municipal bonds. Market share gains account for the vast majority of the increase across each product category with US high-yield volume up 21%, emerging markets volume up 18%, Eurobond volume up 15% and municipal bonds up 75%.  Our rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2020 and we are beginning to see volume contribution from both our new dealer-to-client trading protocol and our recently launched hedging initiatives. Over 150 clients are now approved for our click-to-trade rates offering.  Regarding April activity with seven full days of trading left in April, it is far too early to draw any conclusions on the full month. However, TRACE market volumes are currently running below Q1 levels and our market share is maintaining levels similar to Q1.  Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials. 
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. On slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was a record $195 million, up 16% year-over-year. The 14% increase in credit trading volume led to a 13% uplift in commissions.  Post-trade services revenue more than doubled to $10.3 million and includes $4 million of trade reporting revenue from clients added through the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition.  Operating income was up 14% year-over-year and operating margin was 53% in the first quarter. EBITDA hit a record quarterly level in the quarter. Other expense was $1.6 million in the first quarter and includes foreign currency transaction losses of $500,000. Absent unpredictable items like foreign currency transaction and investment gains and losses, we would expect other expense to run around $1 million per quarter.  The effective tax rate was 21% in the first quarter and reflects $4 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Inclusive of the recently enacted increase in the New York state corporate tax rate, we are maintaining our full year effective tax rate guidance range of 22% to 24%.  On slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 15% year-over-year. On a composite basis, the majority of the 17% increase in credit transaction fees was driven by estimated market share gains. The decline in rates transaction fees was due to lower US treasury's trading volume, principally resulting from a decline in estimated dealer-to-dealer market volumes.  US high-grade fee per million was down $7 versus the fourth quarter level, but $4 higher year-over-year. There were several factors contributing to the sequential decline in fee capture including a shift in trade size. The duration impact on US high-grade fee capture was muted on a sequential quarterly basis as longer years to maturity on bonds traded over the platform was offset by higher bond yields. Our other credit category fee per million of $202 was similar to both the fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2020 levels. Product mix along with fee capture at the individual product level was very consistent across these periods.  Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. First quarter expenses were up 18% year-over-year and include $3.6 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and non-recurring integration costs related to the Regulatory Reporting Hub business. Excluding the regulatory Reporting Hub activity, expenses were up 14% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant currency basis.  The rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in headcount of 74 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors including M&A transaction and integration costs and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development, along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. While Open Trading volume increased 20%, overall clearing costs were down 15%.  In March, we completed the second phase of our settlement project with the transition to a new settlement agent in the UK. Although, we expect to realize some further cost improvements over the balance of this year, I'm happy to report that third-party clearing costs measured on a per ticket basis declined by over 35% year-over-year.  As Chris mentioned, we closed on the MuniBrokers acquisition on April 9th. We expect MuniBrokers expenses will be around $4 million in 2021, 50% of which will be amortization of acquired intangibles. We are updating our full year expense guidance range to $370 million to $386 million to incorporate the MuniBrokers expense activity. On Slide 12 we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments were $415 million at March 31 and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached $340 million. During the first quarter, we paid out year-end employee bonuses and related taxes of roughly $50 million and a quarterly cash dividend of $25 million. We also repurchased 54,000 shares during the quarter, the majority of which were associated with the investing of employee stock awards. We didn't borrow against the revolving credit facility in the first quarter and ended the period with over $300 million of excess net capital resident at MarketAxess Corp, our regulated self-clearing entity. Based on the first quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. Market share gains across all credit products and all geographic regions drove our record results in Q1. Trading automation is advancing in credit products with both dealer and investor clients and MarketAxess Open Trading is leading the way. We continue to invest actively in new product areas like municipal bonds, government bonds and Asia emerging markets to sustain long-term growth. We are also pleased with the progress we are making with new electronic trading protocols. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. You may begin.
Rich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Rick and Tony and Chris. I guess the question is on the fee per million. And slide 4 helps -- it shows the yield to maturity. But I guess the question is Tony, can you review the drivers? We know that duration trade size and mix. But -- and we're just trying to see the moving parts. And if it's easy to compare quarter-to-quarter I believe rather than year-over-year because the big change in yields occurred between 4Q and 1Q I believe? Are you -- can you explain whatever is easier -- easiest that we can understand it I guess?
Tony DeLise: Yes. Happy to do that, Rich. So Rich, you're right that there's lots of factors that influence the high-grade fee capture. And we're really talking about investment-grade here. And years to maturity matters yields matter. We have a tiered fee plan. So trade size matters. We have the mix of dealers that are participating. So for example, dealers that are on a distribution fee plan versus dealers that are on an all variable plan, the fee capture looks different. Even when it comes to protocol, it may look different. Open Trading, fee capture is slightly different than disclosed request for quote. Some of the newer protocols of fee capture is different. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But Rich, you're right. Looking at say Q4 versus Q1, that's probably the best way to describe it. And when you look at those two periods, fee capture was down about $7 per million. A couple of items in there. Trade size was one of them. Not a big influencer, but trade size did tend to shift to a little bit larger trade size as our fee capture is a little bit lower. Dealer mix. So when we look at dealers that are on all variable plans versus fixed plans, a little bit heavier weighting to dealers on fixed plans, fee capture a little bit lower. But the item you mentioned which is very interesting, as Rick picked it up on in his comments, we're at -- close to the post credit crisis high on years to maturity of bonds traded over the platform. Typically, that would result in higher fee capture dollar value of the basis points higher with longer years to maturity. But in this case, what offset the years to maturity was the fact that yields were up. So again, you're right, you look at fourth quarter to first quarter, you did see a rise in bond yields. So those two were largely offsetting. One last thing because I'm getting -- I'm on the clock right now. One last thing just sensitivity going forward every year to maturity is around $10 to $15 per million all things being equal. A 1% change in yields across the yield curve again about a $10 to $15 per million all things -- all else being equal.
Rich Repetto: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. You may begin.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning guys. So I think portfolio trading is up to around 5% of high-grade and high-yield trading volume in recent months. What's driving this adoption by the buyer side? And can you provide an update on MarketAxess efforts to develop a client solution in this area?
Rick McVey: Sure. I'll be happy to start on that Patrick. Thank you for the question. But, yes, you did see growth again in the first quarter in portfolio trading. And I think that situationally clients and dealers are finding good opportunities to use the workflow solutions around portfolio trading for efficiency and execution. And there are a variety of different cases where dealers can promote inventory in baskets to clients, which in an environment like this has been very popular from both sides. You have certain transactions that involves offsetting buys and sells where the combined risk of the basket is less than it would be in individual bonds and can sometimes create efficient execution for both sides. You've also seen trades where investors are making room for new issues through portfolio trading, so a variety of different case studies. And March was an unusually active month for portfolio trading. It's tapered off from what we can see on the TRACE tape in April so far, but very large month in March. We continue to work on our workflow solution there. We are very confident that we are closing the gaps that we have and we'll be competitive in this space. At the same time we're making very large investments in our liquidity solutions through open trading and in new product areas. So it's a convenient workflow solution. It's -- they're a subset of very large dealers that are active a subset of very large clients limited client community but growing importance in the market and it's something that we expect to be competitive in throughout 2021 and beyond. 
Chris Concannon: And Rick I'll just add that we are rolling out enhancements to our portfolio trading solution this quarter and the coming quarters including things like -- critically important things like net hedging that will be available to portfolio trades. The other thing worth mentioning is we are seeing activity in our dealer RFQ platform on Open Trading, which is likely resulting from the liquidation of portfolios that dealers are trading into. So we are getting collateral benefit on the platform particularly in Open Trading and things like investment grade and high yield as a result of these very large block trades that are going up on TRACE and then we're seeing those dealer liquidations happening on the platform.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. You may begin.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up a bit more on some of the market share trends year-to-date and the detail on slide 4 highlights some of the macro factors. But as you think about volatility maybe being a bit more depressed and the work-from-home environment ending as things normalize, how are you thinking about kind of the trajectory of market share from here?
Rick McVey: Yes, I'll start but -- thanks for the question Dan. But listen when we look at broadly at market share trends we're really encouraged by what we see in the first quarter even though as you've point out, market volatility across most credit products was significantly lower than it had been much -- for much of last year. It's coming through most clearly year-over-year gains in high-yield and emerging markets. High grade a little bit more developed market electronically is going to have ebbs and flows based on volatility. And especially with the ETFR community where you would have seen them very active a year ago at high volatility levels and they are always less active in low volatility environments. But beyond that when we look under the hood at the trends that we see with investment managers hedge funds dealers using Open Trading international clients, it's all very encouraging for long-term market share gains. And we have no control over the quarter-to-quarter market conditions. But if you look historically at our consistent growth and success over almost 17 years of being a public company, we've been able to show sustainable long-term growth through any environment. So our expectation is that we have lots of reason for optimism because of the liquidity solutions that we are delivering and the significant transaction cost savings to see share gains through any environment and that is certainly what we saw in the first quarter of this year.
Dan Fannon: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Ari Ghosh from Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Ari Ghosh: Hey, good morning everyone. So I just wanted to come back to some of your new initiatives and rollouts, especially as institutional participation continues to improve this year. Specifically I appreciate any color around the traction that you're seeing around Live Markets and then also the opportunity for market access in China just given that there's been some recent regulatory changes and relaxation of requirements for investors. So just trying to think about how you scale that opportunity and time lines around when you think that may start rolling into your numbers in a meaningful manner? Thanks so much.
Chris Concannon: Well, great question. So on live markets I'll start. We're seeing more activity on Live Markets and it's quite encouraging, because it is a brand new protocol to the credit space. And what we have seen is we've got 19 dealers live on the platform. We expect to have new announcements around designated market makers on the platform as well. We would likely have up to three designated market makers. Those are fully committed two-sided market makers on the platform and we expect to have announcements around that in the coming quarter, very encouraging signs on the size of trades on Live Markets. Right now our average trade size on Live Markets is $2 million, which is much larger than your traditional RFQ average on the platform. So we're encouraged that there is sizable live liquidity with two-way markets and over 250 Q-sips across the platform. So, again, it's a new protocol. The changes in workflow and trading behavior by clients is a sizable lift. But the liquidity that's building on the platform is encouraging. And the opportunity for clients to join a bid or an offer and not cross spread is growing as that liquidity on Live Markets grow. I'll let Rick cover our recent activities in Asia and the growth of our volumes there. 
Rick McVey: Sure. We highlighted in the prepared remarks that we're really encouraged by the developments we see with our APAC business. And part of it is organic where we see more dealers and investor clients embracing electronic trading and trading consistently across the platform. Part of it we hear back from dealers is a view that our competitive position has gotten even stronger in EM globally and particularly in the Asia region. So really good news there in terms of the trends in EM broadly in very large markets. With respect to China, I think, that it's very clear that they will continue to take additional steps to open up their fixed income markets. And given the presence we have with global investors in our EM franchise, we know that we can play a significant role in bringing investor order flow into China. And we're also encouraged by southbound traffic where it's likely that investors within China will be trading more actively outside of China. So we would expect to be more involved in that market. We are taking the steps to be eligible to do so, and we're hopeful that our presence in EM is going to make a significant contribution to the Chinese goal of opening up their fixed income markets.
Ari Ghosh: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Alex Blostein: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just sticking with some of the new initiatives, Chris you highlighted muni markets. I was hoping to dig into that a little bit more. Can you provide us, I guess maybe some specifics around what MarketAxess is doing in order to enable greater pace of electronification in the muni market today? What are some of the biggest hurdles? Obviously, it feels like there's a lot of inertia in that space. I'm trying to think how you guys are trying to break through that? And how much of the muni market do you think could ultimately become electronically traded? 
Chris Concannon: Sure. I'll tackle that one. Well, I continue to be excited about the muni market and our opportunity there. You're talking about a very large market, a difficult market to trade because of the breadth of product in that market. Data analytics will prove to be very helpful in the muni market as we break down the more manual parts of the market and add electronic trading. I'm encouraged by our growth in munis. Obviously the 75% year-over-year increase in that market is encouraging. Also, I'm encouraged by the size of our all-to-all market in munis. So all-to-all is proving to be a very important component to our growth rate. It's now 43% of our volume in munis. The other areas that -- we're seeing areas like dealer RFQ in munis grow over 170% year-over-year. So we are seeing dealers using our platform similar to the way they would use an inter-dealer market -- inter dealer broker market. We obviously have closed the acquisition of MuniBrokers that's approximately 4% of the muni market heavily weighted towards exempt Munis. So we're working on the integration of that market and we plan to have that integrated more largely in 2021. I do think as you think about that market there's sizable costs to large investors to maintain their large -- small trade size across the muni market. And we're seeing investments from the large investment managers to reduce their costs in that market similar to the way they've embraced electronic trading across their investment-grade high-yield trading guests. So we just see that trend continuing. We see getting higher penetration rates in those large client flows in the muni market. I can't predict how far it goes. But given the small ticket sizes the complexity of the market I would expect high dependency on electronic solutions for the years to come.
Tony DeLise: And Alex just one last thing just on the size of the market. And think about where we are today. We're at about 2% market share. And we've talked about this before in terms of revenue opportunity. For us every 1% of share equates to about $10 million in annual revenue. We don't know where this will end up in terms of electronic adoption, but you can do a little math around it. If half the market goes electronic this is an enormous opportunity. That's why we're so focused on it. That's how we continue to invest. That's all part of the strategy around bringing on board MuniBrokers. So big opportunity ahead of us. 
Alex Blostein: Yes. For sure, it’s overcrowded. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Michael Cyprys: For taking the question. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about block trades, maybe some of the initiatives you have there to further penetrate that. Where you stand today in terms of a block trade penetration? And how you're seeing client behavior change around that?
Rick McVey: Sure. I'm happy to take a start on that, Mike. Thank you. But listen, it's an important part of the market. We're investing in new solutions to address blocks, and we're seeing good progress in some areas as well. And I would point to high-yield in particular, where for many years, almost all of our volume was in odd lot trade sizes. And if you see the big jump year-over-year in high-yield share, the majority of that is driven by more success in what is considered to be block size trades in high-yield over $1 million. So we've moved our market share up primarily by investors and dealers in high yield getting more comfortable with large trade sizes. In high grade, we've been pretty flat around the 10% area lately. Clearly, live markets is intended to attack part of the block trading market in very liquid bonds, where both new issues and benchmark deals trade actively in block size, and very tight bid offer. And we're encouraged as you heard Chris say about some of the developments in Live Markets that we think over the coming quarters are going to make that a viable new addition to activity on our trading platform, and especially in blocks.
Chris Concannon: And I'll just add Rick that, we have a very unique view of the credit market. And we have been developing a number of data solutions that help traders identify the true depth of the market, things like our tradeability data solution. So we do think, we can be super helpful to the average trade desk, when they're determining true size of a block, and how to engage the market. And we do think that will attract larger-sized orders on our platform when we can define for them. What the execution could be, execution costs for that block and the true depth of the market, at the moment in time they want to trade.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
Brian Bedell: Thanks. Good morning. If I can squeeze a two parter in here. I apologize, I joined a few minutes late. But just on -- back to the high-grade market share question, given the growth initiatives, and a pretty good client traction that you have across the different protocols, including Auto-X, and the transaction savings given that versus the challenges of the lower volatility as a sort of a more of a macro headwind. When do you -- maybe --start to answer but when do you think you could cross those initiatives and client traction could outweigh that headwind of volatility as we sort of move through 2021 in terms of having a year-over-year gain in high-grade market share? And then the second part is just -- I don't think you talked about this Chris yet, but just an update on the green bond trading as that seems to be gaining momentum globally.
Rick McVey: Well, I'll start on the volatility question, and then I'm sure Chris would like to update you on the green bond initiative and client adoption as well. But listen volatility comes and goes in every market, right? So yes, it's temporarily a headwind in credit. It's not to say that, it will be that way next week, or next month, or next quarter. So we do have a goldilocks scenario right now, where people are quite optimistic on economic growth for the quarters ahead and that leads to better credit quality among a lot of corporate bond issuers. But our business keeps getting more diversified, right? So, our European business is more important than ever. We talked about Asia global EM is loaded with opportunities. All of them have different cycles and volatility characteristics along the way that, it's not something that we worry that much about. We would not have encouraged anybody last spring to use those volatility levels as the new normal and we would not encourage you today to leave -- to use current levels as the new normal either. And what we do is focus on the long-term is -- and that's where we've had great success is investing in important trading protocols and new markets around the world and new clients onboarding, and there's a lot of that going on right now. And there's a lot of reason to believe that over the coming quarters, there are multiple factors that could increase volatility. So, it's a short-term headwind, but we're not -- it's not something we have sussed over because we've been through all kinds of market environments over the last 17 years.
Chris Concannon: And I'll just add, just when it comes to long-term growth rates. We are encouraged by the growth of fixed income ETFs. We clearly have correlation to some of the growth around fixed income ETFs and the trading of fixed income ETFs. And that long-term growth is underway and quite powerful as you look at the numbers that AUM pouring into fixed income ETFs globally. One reflection of that is in investment-grade in the first quarter our Open Trading, which is an important component of the fixed income, ETFR grew 24% in Q1 over 2020. So, important fundamental growth rates are happening even in the face of macro wins. With regard to green bonds, we're doing a lot of exciting things in the whole ESG area. I'll note that our ESG report is now live up on our website. So, please take a look. There's been a lot of work into that report. And it reflects all the different things we're doing as a company, but also some of the things that we're doing for our client investors who trade green bonds. First quarter Green Bond volume was $13 billion. So we continue to see increases on our platform in Green Bonds. More importantly, we launched last year the Green Bond -- the trading for trees initiative. So, not only are we benefiting from the growth of Green Bonds trading on our platform, but we're taking a stand in the environment and planting trees. We planted 65,000 trees in the first quarter. That's on top of what we planted in 2020, which was 130,000 trees. So, we continue to see a progress there -- and we have a small fire alarm test going on in our background, so please ignore that. But trees are being planted, Green Bonds are being traded. And we're super excited about what we can do in that environment.
Brian Bedell: Very great, and thanks for all this color.
Rick McVey: The last thing I'll say is that the other trend that's important for all of you to keep an eye on is the increase in trading velocity that's taking place in credit. And a variety of factors for that, right? All-to-all trading is bringing a lot of new market participants into credit trading many for the first time. So you have a new base of market makers a new base of systematic credit investors. They are clearly adding to the mix around trading velocity. And then you see all-to-all trading reducing transaction costs which also traditionally will increase velocity. So lots of reasons to be optimistic that we could see higher levels of market turnover in global credit as all client segments seem to be embracing greater levels of electronic trading and trading automation.
Brian Bedell: That makes sense. Thank you so much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Sean Horgan from Rosenblatt. You may begin.
Sean Horgan: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about, hiring plans for the year. How many new hires are you targeting for 2021? And how many of those are -- will be technology hires?
Tony DeLise: Yes, sure Sean, I'm happy to take the question. And a big component of our expenses it is compensation and benefits. It's more than 50% of our cost. And this year as we entered the year, we were looking to add somewhere around 60 or 70 personnel. And the majority of that -- the vast majority of that would be in the technology space. We've got -- when you look at where we ended the first quarter with around 610 people we've got -- just to put in perspective, right now we've got about -- line of sight on 50 roles with names attached to those roles. And about half of those are part of our college grad program, but we've got line of sight on around 50 roles today. So we feel pretty good about hitting that target of adding 60 personnel or 70 personnel over the balance of the full year.
Sean Horgan: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from line Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Ari Ghosh: This is my follow-up guys. Tony just a quick clean up item and again apologies if I missed this one, but just looking at the 1Q non-op expense of that $1.7 million. I'm wondering if that's a good starting point for 2Q. I know there's a commitment fee here in the numbers but I was wondering if the other moving parts that might drop off next quarter? Thanks so much.
Tony DeLise: Yes, sure Ari. And I know it's been a challenge to predict that line item. There's a variety of non-operating items in there. So you've got foreign currency transaction gains a lot hard to predict that one. You've got unrealized and realized gains and losses on the investment portfolio. Again hard to predict, there are items like our credit facility fees in there as well. But it was around $1.6 million in the first quarter. That did have some foreign currency transaction losses in there. Absent these unpredictable items -- this is what I had in the prepared remarks, absent the unpredictable items, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, unrealized and realized gains and losses on the investment portfolio. We think it's going to be about $1 million per quarter. That's where it would have been in the first quarter, that's where it would have been in the fourth quarter. Again, absent these unpredictable items, that's where we think it will be over the balance of the year.
Ari Ghosh: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions. So I'll turn the call over to, Rick McVey for any closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. And we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on January 27, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and full year 2020; Chris Concannon, President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss automation and growth initiatives; and then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. We finished the year strong with significant business momentum in the fourth quarter. Market share gains in core products fueled a 32% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 51% increase in operating income. Revenue for the quarter was $171 million and EPS of $1.91 was up 45% versus last year. High-grade market share reached a new high of 22.8%, and high-yield share surged to a new record of 17.1%, up from 10.6%. Open Trading volume grew 63% to $218 billion in the fourth quarter, driving estimated transaction cost savings of $225 million to our clients. We closed on the acquisition of Deutsche Borse's Regulatory Reporting Hub during the quarter, and client on-boarding and integration is underway. On the back of the strong results, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.06 per share, up from $0.60. Slide 4 highlights our record full year results. Our long-term results show consistent execution of our growth agenda with strong 5 year and 10-year compound revenue growth of 18% and compound EPS growth of 25%. For full year 2020, revenue growth was 35% and EPS growth was 45%. The results this year reflect strength in all of our core credit products with record volume and revenue in US high-grade, high yield, global EM, Eurobonds, and Munis. Total credit trading volume was up 29% in 2020 to $2.6 trillion. Active trading client firms during 2020 surpassed 1,800, about half of which are outside of the US. Open Trading grew to 33% of our traded volume, up from 26% in 2019. Estimated transaction cost savings from Open Trading skyrocketed to $1.1 billion for the full year. Investors and dealers both had this year record order flow into our Open Trading liquidity pool in 2020. Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. As of year-end, high-grade credit spreads have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Credit spread volatility has also been declining over the last several quarters. High grade and high yield bond issuance peaked in Q2 and fell back to more normal levels in Q4. As a result of the combination of lower volatility and more normal new issue activity, TRACE volume was up just 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Average years to maturity for corporate bonds traded on the system remained at the high end of the historical range at 9.4 years. This is one of the factors contributing to our increase in the fee capture per million in high-grade. These market conditions are normally not favorable for volume growth. However, market share grew strongly during the second half of the year, driving superior revenue and earnings growth. Slide 6 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading saw sustained growth even though market conditions normalized in the second half of the year, demonstrating the central role of our marketplace in today's credit market. Open Trading credit volume in the fourth quarter increased 63% and overall credit trading revenue grew 34% versus last year. For the quarter, Open Trading represented approximately 34% of our global credit trading volume, up from 27% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Dealer initiated Open Trading volume grew 70% year-over-year, and over 1,600 unique client firms completed at least one trade in Open Trading during the quarter. Open Trading volume show strong growth trends in each of our core products. We are creating new trading and portfolio opportunities for our clients by delivering over 28,000 Open Trading orders per day, totaling $15 billion in daily notional value. During the year, we also delivered important protocol enhancements, including live markets. Our order book for actively traded corporate bonds as well as Mid-X, our sessions based matching platform that utilizes our composite plus mid-market data. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on automation, information services and post-trade.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick. Slide 7 demonstrates the growing momentum of automation in credit trading. Automated trading volumes rose to $32 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $24.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Auto-X trade count grew in the quarter to 163,000, up 28% from the prior year. We are also seeing a healthy adoption of Auto-X across Eurobonds, high yield, and emerging market bonds. The average trade size conducted through Auto-X is also rising. In US investment grade, the average trade size in 2020 grew 14% compared to 2019, and 40% compared to 2018. Clients continue to increase the size of their orders as they gain comfort with the execution quality of our Auto-X solution. The use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform with approximately 3.9 million Algo responses in the fourth quarter resulting in 308,000 trades. The average number of responses per inquiry remain strong, which ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform. Our new automated liquidity provisioned solution, Auto Responder, has seen early traction. The solution allows investors to automatically respond to requests for liquidity through Open Trading. In 2020, over $10 billion in notional value was automatically made available through our Auto Responder solution. As the overall share of electronic trading grows in credit, we are seeing continued demand for our automated trading solutions. Slide 8 provides an update on product diversification. Market data and analytics has never been more in demand than today. Information services revenue reached $34.3 million for the year with a 5-year compounded growth rate of 11%. Our unique data solutions are assisting bond, pricing and liquidity providers on our trading platform, thus helping to generate greater transaction volume. In the years following the implementation of MiFID II, our post-trade services business has grown substantially. Post-trade revenues were at $19.5 million in 2020, up 23% year-over-year. Reflecting our commitment to post trade, we recently announced the completed acquisition of Deutsche Borse's Regulatory Reporting Hub, which adds significant client penetration in Continental Europe and strengthens our data capabilities. Our Rates business had a critical milestone in the fourth quarter by integrating US treasury trading capabilities within the MarketAxess platform, providing a centralized fixed income trading solution with a full click-to-trade suite of products. This allows current credit trading users to seamlessly access this unique Rates trading solution with complete post-trade integration. We also launched our net hedging solution in Q4, which supports our credit trading clients' ability to efficiently hedge their corporate bond transactions. Slide 9 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our US high-grade bonds were up 26% year-over-year to $318 billion for the quarter, largely due to market share gains, and an increase in market volumes. Estimated US high-grade market share increased by 2.8 percentage points year-over-year to 22.8%, while estimated US high-grade market volumes were up 10% year-over-year. Volumes in our other credit category were up 36% year-over-year to $321 billion for the quarter. Market share gains account for the vast majority of the 74% increase in US high-yield volume. Eurobond volumes experienced a 31% increase, and emerging market bond volume grew by 19% year-over-year. I'm also excited to report that our municipal bond volume doubled year-over-year. Our Rates business maintained its dealer to dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2019 in what was a difficult market environment. We believe the investment made in new trading technology, expanded product coverage, and enhanced data tools will continue to differentiate our Rates offering. Our 2020 Green Bond trading initiative was very successful with $27 billion Green bonds traded on the platform resulting in nearly 135,000 trees planted in critical regions across the world. With three trading days remaining in January, estimated US TRACE market volumes are running more than 10% above January 2020, while estimated Eurobond and emerging markets volumes are similar to January 2020. Estimated combined market share across our four core products is seasonally below the fourth quarter levels, but well above the January 2020 levels. Our month-to-date average daily trading volume in credit products is up more than 20% versus January 2020. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 10 we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was $171 million, up 32% year-over-year. The 31% increase in credit trading volume and higher overall credit fee capture resulted in a 33% uplift in commissions. Post-trade services revenue was up 67% to $6.6 million and reflects 1 month of trade reporting activity from clients added to the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition. Operating income was up 51% year-over-year and operating margin reached 53.5% during the quarter. Full year 2020 operating margin was up more than 5 percentage points to 54.4%. The effective tax rate was 19.2% in the fourth quarter, and our full year effective tax rate came in at 20%, which was right at the low end of our 2020 guidance range. On Slide 11 we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 40% year-over-year driven by the increase in credit trading volume and higher US high-grade fee capture. US high-grade fee per million was down $12 versus the third quarter level, but $17 higher year-over-year. Combination of shorter duration and higher weighting to larger trade sizes accounted for the sequential decline in fee capture. Our other credit category fee capture decreased by $6 on a sequential basis, but was $11 higher year-over-year. The slight drop in sequential other credit fee capture was principally due to a mix shift with a greater weighting towards Eurobonds and emerging markets and sovereign bonds. The sequential change in distribution fees was due to variances and unused minimum commitment fees under all variable dealer plans. Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. The year-over-year rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in headcount of 79 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors including M&A transaction and integration costs, and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development and the trading platform along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. Clearing costs were up almost 50% reflecting the 63% increase in Open Trading volume. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we expect our steady state third party clearing costs for credit trading measured as a percentage of Open Trading revenue or on a per ticket basis to decline by upwards of one-third. Excluding M&A transaction and integration costs and the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Regulatory Hub acquisition, expenses were up 12% in the fourth quarter. On Slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of December 31 were $489 million, and free cash flow reached a record $340 million in 2020. Dividends and share repurchases aggregated $150 million and capital expenditures were $46 million in 2020. With the announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, we have tripled the dividend level over the past five years, which matches the growth in earnings and free cash flow generation. Our Board recently authorized a new $100 million share repurchase program to replace the plan expiring at the end of the March. As has been our practice, the principal purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset dilution from employee equity grants. During the fourth quarter, we also entered into a new $500 million revolving credit facility with the syndicated banks to support our clearing activities and add financial flexibility. There were no borrowings outstanding at year-end under this facility. On Slide 14, we have laid out our 2021 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures, and the effective tax rate. We expect that total 2021 expenses will be in the range of $362 million to $382 million. Employee compensation and benefit costs are expected to represent around 50% of total expenses consistent with the trend over the past several years. We have built the plan using a sterling to US dollar exchange rate of 1.35, which has the effect of adding around $4 million to the expense guidance. This guidance range reflects a full year of operating expenses related to the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition including an estimated $5 million for amortization of acquired intangibles and $5 million in non-recurring integration costs. Excluding the expenses related to Regulatory Reporting Hub, the midpoint of the guidance range would represent an approximate 13% year-over-year increase in expenses on a constant currency basis. 2021 capital expenditures are expected to range from $50 million to $55 million of which roughly two-third relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and enhancements to the trading platform. We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2021 will range from 22% to 24%. The increase in the effective tax rate versus 2020 is driven by lower estimated excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Based on the expected timing for realizing the excess tax benefits, the effective tax rate will likely be in the 20% range in the first quarter, and then the 24% to 25% range in the second, third and fourth quarters. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. 2020 was an outstanding year for revenue and earnings growth. I want to thank all MarketAxess employees for their dedication that led to these terrific results. Market share momentum in the second half of 2020 positions us well for continued growth in the years ahead. We are investing heavily to grow our portfolio of products, protocols, and clients in order to continue our track record of long-term sustainable growth. We would now be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
Dan Fannon: Hi, thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is for Tony on the expenses, and just kind of the outlook. Looking at the organic expense growth, it's slightly higher than where I think you started out last year in terms of what you were going to spend on. Could you maybe highlight some of the areas to spend, and kind of initiatives that might be different year-over-year? And then -- yes, so that, and then also just any other kind of normalization of spending that might be factored in in terms of travel and spending around kind of the macro and COVID related expenses.
Tony DeLise: Sure, Dan. Happy to take that one. So on the expense guidance, we tried to give you the pieces, it's easier to explain in the two pieces, which is the organic growth and then the the Regulatory Reporting Hub overlay on top of that. I'd say, we're guiding to a 13% constant currency increase. It probably shouldn't be a surprise. If you look at history, Rick had given some color on the revenue and earnings CAGRs. If you look at the expense CAGR over the past five or ten years, it's 15%. So the 13% that we're guiding to is really right in line with history. And I would tell you also that I'd suggest that shareholders will continue to support that type of continuing investment if you look at the revenue and earnings growth that we've delivered over the years. But put that aside, in terms of the pieces, the -- on the organic piece we, we entered 2021 with a full investment agenda. We've got new protocols, newer product areas, geographic expansion efforts. So we're continuing on that investment path. Individual line items, and this won't be a surprise, where you're going to see most of the absolute expense increase is in comp and benefits. It's really head count driven. You think about the 80 or so people that we added in 2020. We have plans to add another 60 or so personnel to support our growth agenda in 2021, so it won't be a surprise that that's the line item that will dominate the expense increase. The other piece, you look at -- and this will be along the investment theme. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be 25% or so higher than 2020 on an organic basis. And that reflects the investment we've been making in Trading protocols and the platform, and specifically it revolves around the amortization of software development costs. So those are the big items. And I'd give you two other items just to give you a little bit of color. Yes, we expect an increase in marketing and advertising and G&A expenses, which would be driven by the resumption of T&E. Right now in our models we've got travel and entertainment resuming sometime in the second half of the year. So you'll see some increase there, but that's not what's dominating the absolute numbers. The other one, just to give you a little bit of color. We are expecting clearing costs to be flattish year-over-year. And I do want to spend just two minutes on that because there's two components to clearing costs. You have clearing costs related to credit, and then you have clearing costs related to US treasuries. And we're budgeting in the aggregate to be flat. The savings that we anticipate from going to self-clearing and transitioning settlement agents in the UK, those savings will likely be offset by an increase in expected volume from Open Trading and an increase in US Treasury -- and an increase in US treasury trading volume. So even though we're expecting steady state savings from the transitioning in clearing of $5 million or $6 million, we expect that to be offset. So just wanted to give you a little bit of color on that. Boy that was a long-winded answer. Wasn't it?
Dan Fannon: I fell asleep.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.
Richard Repetto: Yes, good morning guys. I had a question. Good morning. I had a question on automated trading but Chris covered it so well I can skip it. So I'll go right to the other -- the long-winded answer that Tony had. On the self-clearing, you mentioned that you reduce it by, I thought you said a third. But I thought that percentage, I thought it was like -- it's running at 12% of Open Trading revenue right now, and I thought that could cut in half. And just trying to understand why -- it doesn't seem like we saw any impact in this quarter and I thought we ramped or started to launch it in August. And where are we at as we enter the new year in regards to fully have all the capital in place etcetera?
Tony DeLise: So, Rich -- and I'm happy to answer the follow-on question on this. And really you need to look at the clearing cost in two pieces. And we have the cost associated with clearing Open Trading corporate bond transactions. And that has to do with self-clearing in the US, transition to the settlement agent in the UK. And that's why we've been talking about a reduction in those clearing costs by upwards of a third. But the second component -- and this is part of why you're not seeing the reduction. The second component is clearing costs for US treasury trading where market access intermediates those trades. In the near term we're leaving that treasury clearing model in place. And I've talked about this in the past. Clearing cost for treasuries runs somewhere around 30% of treasury revenue. It depends on the protocol, it depends on trade size during the quarter. Longer term, we'll look at rationalizing the broker-dealers and ultimately addressing the clearing model longer term. But you have to look at those two pieces. Now, in the fourth quarter -- and admittedly, we did see some improvement in clearing costs. So for example as a percentage of Open Trading revenue for credit, clearing costs were a little more than 9%. They had been running -- the prior year was a little a little higher than 11% in the fourth quarter. So we did see some improvement, but we acknowledge that there were some teething pains in the fourth quarter. We're still -- we're looking at 2021 expenses, third-party clearing cost expenses for credit. We believe that the savings will be upwards on a -- of a third on a steady state basis whether you look at it as a percentage of open trading revenue, on a per ticket basis, on a per million traded basis, we are still looking at about a 30% or so savings. So it doesn't come through clearly in the numbers, but some of it has to do with -- again with -- we have 2 elements to our clearing cost, both corporate bonds, and then on the treasury side.
Rick McVey: And Rich, just to complete that thought, if you look at our self-clearing it's fully converted in the US across our products and OT. So we're fully up and running. Our conversion in Europe is targeted for the end of the first quarter. And then with regard to our treasury platform, anything that we recently launched, as I mentioned our Click to Trade solutions and our integrated Rates trading platform, that all comes through our self-clearing solution today. So growth in rates in 2021 as part of our new offering -- our unique new offering, will be self-cleared. We're also looking at our third-party clearing relationships and -- with regard to our current DDD platform and we continue to look at optionality whether we want to self clear and when. So a lot of movement will happen in -- continue to happen in 2021 with regard to third party clearing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point.
Chris Allen: Yes, good morning, guys. I wanted to ask, just on the fully integrated Rates trading capability now and the net hedging. Just what kind of uptick you've seen so far, what's the client participation been like and just kind of how is the outlook on that product suite?
Rick McVey: Sure. Great, great question. Just going back to 2020 on our Rates business, we launched auto hedging which is really a dealer solution to protect dealers on their hedging capability. Net hedging was launched late in the fourth quarter and rolled out on a pilot basis. It is now go live in Q1. And we're seeing obviously a long list of clients that have had interest in that net hedging solution for some time. So the client take up should roll out here in the first and second quarter with additional enhancements to net hedging over the first half of the year. With regard to the fully live Rates solution, couple of movements there. I think one of the more exciting things is our integrated trading solution, fully Click to Trade liquid streams and both on the run. And more importantly, our very unique off the run streaming solution, which really no other platforms have streaming off the runs to institutional clients. So that's new as part of our offering. We also plan to launch RFQ in the first half of this year. So we'd have a combined Click to trade. So for your more liquid front end of the curve would be click to trade solutions. And then, you would be able to RFQ across the curve for a larger trade size or less liquid products. And that right now is being communicated to our clients and the demand is quite high, particularly around the events of last year and the liquidity constraints that we're on, some of the other platforms offering Rates trading. So there is some excitement from our clients on providing not only a full breadth of product with unique off the run click to trade solutions, but also having a unique liquidity on the platform similar to how we run our credit trading solutions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse.
Ari Ghosh: Hey, good morning everyone. Maybe a quick one for either Rick or Chris, on the evolution of the Muni and the EM markets. Looking at both of EM and especially Munis, they have low level of electronification, limited data and transparency. So I was hoping that you could talk about your broader strategy including initiatives including leveraging platform data and your recent acquisitions to kind of sort these inefficiencies. And if you have a sense for size of the revenue opportunity here and potential timeline of some of these structural [indiscernible] to take hold. Thanks.
Rick McVey: Yes, I'm happy to take a start at RA and I'm sure Chris will have some follow-up points. But I'm glad you pointed out two enormous growth opportunities for us and we're excited about the progress that we made in the municipal bond market during the course of 2020 and all signs are that we can add a lot of value there in terms of transaction cost savings and efficiency in the years ahead. And you're right, the institutional market really hasn't been electronic historically. So there is a lot of market share available there that is still done either through instant messaging or through phone conversations that we think will benefit from our platform. And as you know the Muni market is the most fragmented bond market in the world. So Open Trading adds a tremendous amount of value, where we can connect all market participants into our all liquidity pool and add value in terms of connecting people and finding the other side of the trade. EM is much the same. It's been an important growth area for us for many years, but we're more excited about what's still ahead. And when you're here at MarketAxess, you don't really think all that much about the part of the market that's already electronic. You think about the 75% of global credit that's not yet electronic, and global EM is a great example of that where we are connecting not only hard currency debt in EM but 26 local markets all on one marketplace with a combination of dealer liquidity and alternative liquidity through all our Open Trading. So we think we've got a tremendous opportunity there. We're excited about the signs we see of beginning of electronic trading adoption in important areas like Asia. We are seeing really good client take up going on there and that will be an important part of our global EM strategy. But this is why we're investing the way that we are as Tony talked about earlier, is the future opportunity is just so large and Munis and global EM are just two of many examples that we're looking at right now. And just to put it in context of the whole market, if you look at the full year 2020, the top five banks alone had global FICC revenue of $68 billion. Market access had a record year at about $690 million or 1% of that revenue pie. So we see tremendous opportunity ahead as the market continues to adopt to the structural changes that are taking place, new forms of liquidity, the growth in ETF assets, the growth in portfolio trading. We're really excited about what we see is the change in the market taking place that will undoubtedly increase market turnover and velocity, and that's what really fuels our interest in continuing to invest in this business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back to some of the commentary earlier around automated trading. Hearing that the size of the trades going through there is increasing. Just curious if you could add any color on the block size penetration, where that is now, how that's evolving and how you might be able to increase the block penetration on the automated trading side even further, whether it's in terms of new protocols in innovation, just how you're thinking about that?
Rick McVey: Sure. And again, the automated trading solution has been largely adopted by clients for small ticket solution. It hasn't been targeted for larger ticket. However, as we think about developing the automated suite of products, our target is for block trades, particularly when you start to integrate both Auto Responder which is the ability to provide liquidity to other parties who were requesting price, and Auto-X. And putting together those products into a single suite or a single order similar to a client algorithm would allow larger block quarters to provide liquidity throughout the day, and then Auto-X at the end of the day. So both, be a liquidity provider and a liquidity taker all in one automated solution. Those are some of the targets that we have in 2021 as part of the initiatives around automation. But today as we see the current client experience, the execution quality for trades somewhere around $2 million in size is quite similar to anything $5 million in size. So that's why we're seeing a nice growth -- 14% growth year-over-year on trade sizes and automation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Maybe a bigger picture question on the high-yield business. I think when we've talked about the liquidity characteristics of that high yield market versus high-grade in the past, there is agreement that the eventual electronic penetration rate in that high yield market will be lower than the high-grade market. Just curious to hear your updated thoughts there, and if it changed at all just given that we've just seen tremendous growth in high-yield electronic trading last year. Just wondering if there is something different about the ETF market or the hedge fund adoption or growth there that's changed your long-term view on kind of the high-yield eventual electronic penetration rates.
Rick McVey: Great, thanks for that, Kyle, and you're right. This is undoubtedly the best year-over-year market share growth story we've ever had at MarketAxess seeing the inflection point in high yield during the course of 2020. But I'd point to a number of things, it's the size of our Open order trading -- open trading order book now is so significant that it's drawing new interest into our platform for high-yield trading, and the results are very good in terms of the quality of execution of the transaction cost savings that we can deliver. So that creates this virtuous cycle where investors are more inclined to continue to put more orders into the system because of the transaction cost savings that they are achieving. I'd also say this is a market which is a great example of the changes taking place in fixed income because we have very active alternative market makers that are now committing new capital to the high yield market. This is their primary way of transacting with end institutional clients, is through the MarketAxess system. The hedge funds are getting much more involved in our high-yield platform and finding great trading opportunities. And then, there is a significant growth going on in systematic credit trading strategies, and we see a lot of activity and rebalancing from systematic strategies coming into the high-yield platform. So it's really a combination of factors. And yes, I do -- we all have higher thoughts now about where that electronic share will go. The other thing that's been really interesting to observe over the last three or four quarters is that a year ago, the bulk of our activity in high yield was really in $1 million in under trade sizes. We're now doing significantly better in round lot high yield trading, which is a terrific sign that the market is getting much more comfortable putting larger trade sizes through on the high-yield system. So we are really pleased with the results, but we think there is a long way to go. We are 17% of the market in the fourth quarter and the other 83% is mostly conducted through traditional means. So, there is a lot of runway left in the high yield market and we're excited about what we see.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys, good morning. Just another big picture question to kind of follow up on that last one. I know market share is going to vary in any given year based on the conditions in the market, but over let's say a five year horizon at this stage, what is your expectation for your market share gains in high-grade and high-yield given the acceleration we saw in 2020?
Rick McVey: I just think that there are many favorable macro trends that are working their way through the global credit markets and leading to very positive market share trends on MarketAxess. And I've mentioned them briefly earlier, but the growth in ETF funds under management is driving a lot of activity in the underlying bonds. It's creating a lot of relative value trading activity between the ETF shares in the underlying bond market. Portfolio trading is really driving a lot of activity into our system on managing the tail risk in blocked both transactions that take place. And you're seeing this huge growth in both buy side and sell side, new entrants and new participants in global credit markets. So it leaves me feeling like we are going to see five years of very healthy growth in market share and a significant portion of global credit over the next five to ten years is likely to be electronic. And this is why we have no hesitation about investing heavily in the business, is the majority of the business today is still conducted through traditional means. And I think the direction of travel is very clear that electronic trading percentage of the market will continue to grow because of the transaction cost benefits that we are delivering and the efficiency it brings to all market participants and the fact that it does allow everybody to participate on a level playing field. So we see many good years ahead in terms of market share gains.
Tony DeLise: And Rick, I'll just add, when you look at electronic market share growth in the global credit market, it should experience similar characteristics to other markets where you also see combined with that electronic growth in market share, turnover growth. We witnessed that in 2020 and we expect that to continue. So as the electronic piece of the market grows, and certainly people in the industry forecast they can be as high as 90% of the overall market, you will likely see higher turnover rates across the global corporate bond market as well. And we're seeing elements of that happening where certain hedge fund -- systematic hedge funds are entering the market using our platform and that -- we've seen those entries in other asset classes where turnover does increase. So you can't just look at it is a single number what is electronic market share of the overall market. You do typically experienced higher turnover rates in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein: Hey guys, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe building on that last response. Can you provide some evidence over the course of the last, call it year, maybe year and a half of where larger sized trades get broken down into smaller trades that ultimately kind of make their way into your market. I know that that's also a big part of some of the initiatives and the protocols that you guys have been putting together. I'm just trying to put some numbers around that and to see how much of that has actually been coming through.
Rick McVey: So, the only thing I would -- I mean we see large blocks go up, we see large portfolios go up on TRACE. And then we obviously see activity on our platform as a result of those trades. I think one area of evidence that we're benefiting from some of the block trades aside from just our overall block trade growth rate and then IG block trading were up 11% in Q4. It's just our dealer RFQ initiative that we really were pushing throughout 2020 has seen exceptional growth where dealers are coming to us for liquidation of positions. And largely those liquidations are as a result of a larger block trade that was done and they have either pieces of that trade that they are unloading or other pieces of a portfolio that they are liquidating. So really our dealer RFQ growth rate and in Q4 in high-yield alone, our dealer RFQ offering doubled in volume and overall dealer RFQ was up substantially throughout 2020. So I think that's an area of evidence where we may not be capturing the original block, but we're seeing the benefits of the liquidation of block pieces.
Chris Concannon: And our own view is that trading automation is still in early innings in Global Credit. And I think if that takes hold over the coming years, you're going to see more optionality among institutional investors in terms of how they execute blocks. It's not evident in terms of the percentage of block trading and TRACE yet, but I think automation will play a part of that story in the years ahead. And I think it will give another option to investors when they think about the best way to execute blocks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.
Richard Repetto: Yes, I have a follow-up for Mister Automation over there. So if we look at 2020 it appears that -- like it was a year of Open Trading like you talked about earlier, Rick, it helped high yield market share etc. But when you look at all the initiatives you got going on, whether it'd be blocks -- higher block trades or high turnover portfolio trading, let's just say in the next six to 12 months, like what you really think -- which [indiscernible] do you think will really hit -- are you expected to hit in 2021?
Rick McVey: Well, I think, I'll start with our investment in treasuries and the Rates business, that's an area that I'm most excited about, because of our unique offering. It also comes with a little bit of automation. So remember you can wrap automation around the treasuries offering that we're launching in 2021. I think I said a year ago that I loved Munis, and if you look at our performance in Munis in 2020 we're more excited about the opportunity in 2021 given our growth rate. We had a record day for Munis and in January just recently, so continue around that [ph]. Our plan for automation is quite sophisticated in how we're starting to combine Auto-X and Auto Responder together to create what are the early days of the traditional algorithm for clients to help point clients take a large block order, be passive throughout the period of the day, have a time to auto execution later in the day. So they can still see the success of the position getting executed but they can improve their execution quality throughout the day. Features where we're providing own masses with trades. It's partial trades on a larger sized orders all being rolled out in 2021. So just a great deal of activity in the automation area across all of our products. And then, as I mentioned in talking points, we're seeing automation uptake across not only just high grade and high yield, but also Eurobonds, EM as well. So pretty big agenda for automation in 2021. I'm not sure if I answered your question, Rich.
Richard Repetto: You did. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Great, thanks. Thanks, good morning folks. Maybe just a follow-on from the market share -- electronic kind of penetration market share argument, maybe the flip side of that. Can you characterize what you think is the headwind from new issuance as banks conduct as [indiscernible] largely trade those on season bonds. Maybe some commentary about through that part of the market, which I guess would be sort of untouchable so to speak, or not, but as viable for electronic penetration, maybe if you can sort of comment on that thought, and roughly what percentage of the market you believe that is.
Rick McVey: Sure. I'm happy to take a shot at that. Brian. But I think what you're referring to is the very robust and record levels of new issuance last year and how that impacts new issue activity this year. And you're right, it would be unreasonable to expect that new issue volume and activity this year will mimic last year. However, when we look at the dealer estimates, it still expected to be an active year. On any normal basis, it was just last year was extraordinary because of the needs for so many corporations to bolster liquidity on their balance sheet during the pandemic. So we would temper our views on new issues secondary trading activity this year relative to last. But we still think the long-term macro trend is toward more market turnover and higher velocity. And the greater electronification of credit markets is one piece of that. And as I mentioned, the new tools around portfolio and ETF to transfer risk are part of that story, and then the massive increase in credit market participants is part of that story. So, we still think in the short term yes, we might have a minor headwind from slightly less newly issued bond trading. But in the long term, we're really bullish on overall market volume and market turnover. But I -- we have new protocols live markets, Mid-X, others that are really designed around actively traded bonds, including newly issued bonds. So we think we have a role to play in that market after the bonds break into the secondary market, and we'll continue to push ahead on that as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. Just a follow-up on the non-transactional revenue and just kind of the outlook for info services as well as post-trade, and if you could separate out the recent acquisition and then the underlying growth rate as we kind of think about 2021.
Rick McVey: Yes, sure, Dan. So on the info services side, Chris had some comments that full year revenue was up around 12%. At any point when you look at the five year compounded annual growth rate for information services, it's right around that 11% or 12% range. In terms of sale, a little bit of guidance for 2021. We've got a pretty decent pipeline as we enter 2021. We think we can deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. And we had new data sales last year with about $6.5 million, it was about 5.5 million the year before that, we've got a pretty good pipeline entering 2021. But I would reiterate what we've said in the past around data that we're also using data to incent clients to trade more on the platform, and that's a a principal use of the content that we're capturing. So we expect to grow the info services revenue double digits. But again, it is an important piece of the information we're delivering and to help clients make make pricing decisions. On the post-trade side, take it in two pieces on the post-trade side, and we had given some color on Regulatory Reporting Hub, what the impact would be. We gave some color in the third quarter. Take that piece. It's somewhere around $1 million per month in revenue is what we're expecting, maybe a little bit higher than that what we're expecting in 2021. On the organic side, we're expecting double-digit growth on the organic side and it's really a full year impact of SFTR reporting which came online midway through 2020. And it's also, we've been adding clients organically. So that -- the combination of those two items, we think we're looking at double-digit organic growth, overlay Regulatory Reporting Hub $1 million or so in revenue a month and that gives you a sense for what we're expecting for 2021.
Dan Fannon: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point.
Chris Allen: Yes, thanks guys. Dan actually asked my question. I guess, just one quick one. There has been some recent calls in Europe for consolidated bond tape. Any thoughts around the impact there and how you could participate?
Rick McVey: Sure, happy to take that. I think it's early days in the new regulatory structure in Europe post-Brexit in terms of where this all lands. Clearly MiFID II included some commentary on consolidated trade tape. I would start by saying we are big fans of market transparency. We think the transparency increases participation and creates a fair marketplace, and Europe is lacking some of that transparency today. So we are supportive of transparency improving in the region. We obviously with our Reg reporting and our e-trading business, have a substantial amount of transaction data and we do think we have a role to play, but it's not exactly clear yet where this will all land. I think, we'll learn more about it over the next year or two, and it will take time before anything is implemented. But we do believe with the vast base of transaction data that we have, we have ways to participate in that.
Chris Allen: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Folks, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just a quick one on Green bonds for Chris. It looks like it's 1% of your volumes overall, so it's still pretty small, growing though. I guess what's your outlook for volume growth in there, maybe share of the market, maybe sort of as you see sort of it a characterization of client demand for that over the next two to three years. And I know your economics on trading aren't any significantly different than your overall revenue capture rates.
Chris Concannon: Great question, I appreciate your question on the Green bond initiative, because it's something we worked closely on all year. Obviously, the goal of the Green bond initiative was certainly to provide our clients with a better solution as they went out to look for filling some of their ESG mandates that they were getting from their own clients, we certainly made Green Bonds much more available on the platform. The nice thing about this solution is we were planting trees for every million dollars of Green bonds that you traded on the platform. So the economic incentives are there, but also the benefits for the environment are there as well, and planting over 135,000 trees as a result of those green bonds traded on platform. Green Bonds and really ESG related bond saw a record issuance in 2020. The forecast for 2021 are even larger. So we expect ESG related bonds to make up a much larger portion of the new issue market in 2021. And we will continue to run our Green Bond trading for tree solution. Clients are getting -- will be getting certificates for the trees that they planted. We're also excited to pick the number one trading for trees trader on the planet. So they'll get an award as we roll out some of the awards for the environmental efforts that our clients participated in. There is another initiative that's related and I think it's worth mentioning, because it cuts across many of our products and that's our diversity dealer solution that we rolled out in the fourth quarter. It's quite exciting, because it really solved some of the similar mandates that our clients have around ESG. And this allows diversity dealers to take advantage of our all-to-all marketplace open trading and attach themselves to that market and participate in trades where they can also save our clients better execution quality and save them money on their actual execution. So our clients are seeing the ability to select a diversity dealer, at the same time as achieve best execution in their execution. So I expect the diversity dealer solution and our Green Bond solution to be quite exciting solutions as we look into 2021 and all the ESG related mandates that are coming down from investors across the globe.
Brian Bedell: That's great color. Thank you.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and all the best to all of you for 2021 and stay safe and stay healthy.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on October 27, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will discuss automation and new initiatives; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some - of the risks factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. Sustained growth in electronic trading adoption by a diverse range of market participants drove trading volumes higher during the quarter. Revenue of $164 million was up 25% year-over-year. Operating income of $88 million was up 33%, and operating margins grew to 53.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.78 are up 25% from a year ago. Market share gains fueled the revenue and earnings growth with fully electronic, high-grade share up two percentage points to a record 22.2% and high-yield share, up over four percentage points to a record 16%. Open Trading volume was up 41% year-over-year, driving estimated client transaction cost savings of over $250 million for the quarter. Trailing 12 months EPS growth of 37% and revenue growth of 31% show an acceleration of growth rates over the last four quarters. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Credit market trading conditions were mixed for our business during the quarter. Credit spreads and spread volatility both trended lower versus the elevated levels earlier this year. New issue volume dropped substantially from Q2, but was 30% higher than Q3 last year. Corporate debt outstanding is up approximately 9% this year to $10.4 trillion. TRACE high-grade and high-yield market volumes declined approximately 28% from Q2 levels but show high single-digit growth from last year. We are pleased to see the positive trend in average years to maturity for our high-grade volume. This demonstrates growing client confidence, trading high-quality, long maturity bond volume on our system. It is also one of the factors driving our average fee capture higher. Slide five provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading continues to show strong year-over-year growth in spite of the return to more normal market conditions, with lower volatility in Q3. Our unique all-to-all marketplace delivered a volume increase of 41% and revenue growth of 53% versus last year. For the third quarter in a row, estimated transaction cost savings of $252 million delivered to our clients, exceed company revenues. We are adding value to liquidity takers and liquidity providers by delivering over 25,000 credit trading opportunities per day and over $14 billion in daily notional volume. For the quarter, Open Trading represented approximately 33% of our trading volume and 27% of our commission revenue. Dealer initiated Open Trading volume grew 37% year-over-year. Nearly 1,600 unique client firms completed at least one trade in Open Trading and nearly 1,000 firms provided liquidity on the system during the third quarter. We believe our large and growing lead in institutional customer order flow, substantial investor and dealer network and unique technology solutions create a sustainable competitive advantage in electronic credit trading. We are also excited about the new trading protocols and product areas we are adding to Open Trading. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on automation and new initiatives.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick. Slide 6 demonstrates the growing momentum of automation in credit trading. Automated trading volumes rose to over $30 billion in the third quarter, up from $22.6 billion in the third quarter of 2019. 86 firms, including large asset management clients used our auto-execution functionality in the third quarter, up from 64, the prior year. Auto-X now represents 14% of total trade count as more clients and dealers realize the efficiency gains of automated trading strategies. The use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform with approximately 3.7 million algo responses in the third quarter, resulting in 296,000 trades. As the market increasingly adopts electronic trading solutions, we continue to see strong growth in our automated trading capabilities. We saw a sharp rise in the average number of responses per inquiry, which ultimately improves the likelihood of execution. Our average number of responses per inquiry has risen steadily from four responses per inquiry in 2017, nearly doubling in the recent quarter. Slide 7 outlines our strategy for new product initiatives. Even while working remotely during the pandemic, we have remained focused on driving innovation and bolstering our global footprint. We announced last week a commitment from Goldman Sachs to provide streaming firm prices for U.S. investment-grade credit into our live markets order book. Live markets aims to bring new liquidity to the credit markets and reduce trading friction through efficient technology designed to enhance liquidity, improve transaction costs. We also recently launched a session-based protocol called Mid-X, launched as part of our Open Trading marketplace. Our Mid-X offering provides participants with access to a broad and diverse liquidity pool while achieving significant cost savings by potentially matching at our award-winning composite plus mid-point price. Mid-X is currently available for European products, and we plan to add more products in the coming quarters. In the third quarter, we also announced two acquisitions, which aim to enhance our existing trading, data and post-trade businesses. Our both acquisitions are relatively small on their own, we believe, in the aggregate, they will add significant value to our full trade life-cycle solution. The acquisition of MuniBrokers, a central electronic venue serving municipal bond into dealer brokers and dealers aims to expand our existing municipal bond trading solution for global institutional investors and dealer clients. The acquisition of Deutsche Borse Group's Regulatory Reporting Hub extends our leading regulatory reporting business across Europe and strengthens our data capabilities with improved transparency and post-trade data services. We expect both acquisitions to close this quarter. Slide eight provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 17% year-over-year to $305 billion for the quarter, largely due to market share gains and the increase in market volumes. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share increased by two percentage points year-over-year to 22.2%, while estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes were up 6% year-over-year. Our other credit category volume was up 11% year-over-year, led again by significant growth in U.S. high-yield trading of our platform. U.S. high-yield volume was up 46% as estimated market share reached a record 16%, up more than four percentage points and estimated trace market volumes rose 9%. While our emerging market's trading volume was flat year-over-year, we are pleased with the results as estimated market volumes were down more than 20%. Our Rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to 3Q 2019 in a difficult market environment. However, our investment in new rates trading capabilities continues with the rollout of our net hedging solution expected later this quarter. We also expect to launch our new fully integrated streaming click-to-trade rates front end within the MarketAxess workstation this quarter, allowing thousands of current credit trading users to access our rates trading solution. Live streaming U.S. treasury liquidity will be made available to our institutional clients and dealers through our existing MarketAxess workstations with full post-trade and OMS integration. We see tangible benefits for our investor and dealer clients through both of these offerings. Our green bond trading initiative continues to support clients' ESG-related investment mandates. In the third quarter, over $5.8 billion worth of green bonds were traded on our platform, resulting in nearly 30,000 trees being planted in critical regions across the world. Over 90,000 trees have been planted thus far this year as a result of our green bond trading initiative. With four important trading days remaining in the month, overall market volumes in our core credit trading products remained flat to last October. However, our October average daily volume on the platform is up more than 20% from last year as we approach the month end. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 9, you provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was $164 million, up 25% year-over-year. The 14% increase in credit trading volume, higher fee capture and the inclusion of U.S. Treasury trading resulted in a 26% uplift in commissions. Information Services revenue was up 11% to $8.5 million. And post-trade services revenue was up 24%, reflecting the introduction of new SFTR reporting services in the third quarter. Operating income was up 33% year-over-year, and operating margin reached 53.5% during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, operating margin was up five percentage points to 54.7%. The effective tax rate was 23% in the third quarter and reflects $5.9 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. During the quarter, we also recorded an additional reserve for uncertain tax positions of $4.8 million. We expect that the full year effective tax rate will be within our previously stated guidance range of 20% to 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.78. The year-over-year increase in our diluted share count was largely due to the 146,000 shares issued as part of the LiquidityEdge acquisition. On slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 28% year-over-year, driven by the increase in credit trading volume, higher U.S. high-grade fee capture and the inclusion of U.S. treasury trading commissions. U.S. high-grade fee per million was $18 higher on a sequential basis and $26 higher year-over-year, mainly due to longer duration. Average years to maturity on bonds traded over the platform hit 9.5 years in the recent quarter, compared to eight years in the third quarter of 2019. Our other credit category fee per million increased by $12 year-over-year, principally due to a shift among products favoring high-yield volume. Fee capture at the individual product level and product mix within other credit was similar to the second quarter. Total distribution fees were $1.3 million higher than the second quarter level, principally due to a rise in unused minimum fees and one dealer transition to a distribution fee plans. Slide 11 provides you with the expense details. On a year-over-year basis, expenses were up 16% for the quarter, with compensation and benefits accounting for close to half of the year-over-year change. The main contributors to the rise in compensation and benefits was an increase in headcount of 88 personnel in support of our growth initiatives and an uplift in the variable bonus provision, which is tied to financial performance. The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. Clearing costs were up more than $2 million, reflecting the 41% increase in open trading volume and inclusion of match Principal treasury trading volume. The reduction in marketing expense for both the quarter and year-to-date is due to COVID limitations on sales-related T&E expense. We expect our full year 2020 expenses will be near the upper end of our guidance range or close to $314 million. The 2020 expense view includes approximately $2 million of acquisition-related transaction costs, but excludes any post-acquisition impact of the MuniBrokers and Deutsche Borse Regulatory Reporting Hub transactions that are expected to close in the fourth quarter. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Our balance sheet has several new line items related to self-clearing, including segregated cash and receivables from and payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers for unsettled trades and deposits. Cash and investments as of September 30 were $341 million compared to $536 million as of June 30. During the quarter, we paid the quarterly cash dividend of $23 million. We also repurchased 33,000 shares in total during the quarter, including 9,000 shares under our buyback program and 24,000 shares associated with the exercise of employee stock awards. We went live with self-clearing for U.S. bond trades on August 10. We funded certain clearing house and settlement agent deposit requirements, customer reserve account and settlement position activity, which aggregated $260 million at September month end. These requirements will fluctuate with Open Trading volumes, market volatility and settlement experience. As a result of our conversion to self-clearing for U.S. bond trades, we expect clearing costs on a per ticket basis to decline by upwards of 30%. Based on the third quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.60 regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the ongoing business momentum reflected in our third quarter results. Market share trends in core products are accelerating and new products and trading protocols look promising to expand and diversify our sources of revenue. We are excited about our growing client networks for trading and post-trade services through the recent acquisition announcements. We would now be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Richard Repetto: Yes, good morning and congrats on a strong quarter. What particularly interest to me is a self-clearing, Tony. So now you did say that it would go down 30% per ticket. And I guess, I'm just trying to see, does that immediately hit in the fourth quarter? And how does that sort of aligned with the prior guidance, where I think it's been running at about 12% of open trading revenue? And I thought you could get it down to mid-single digits over time. Will there be any more progression in the timing of these savings for the self-clearing?
Tony DeLise: Sure, sure. Yes. So Rich, just a little reminder that clearing cost today, it's a combination of open trading-related clearing costs on our credit business, but also for treasuries, we do have clearing costs on the treasury side as well. And right now, in the near term, we're leaving that - the clearing model in place on the treasury side. And just again, by way of reference or background, clearing costs in the treasury side run, something like 25% to 30% of treasury revenue. And then on the credit side, that's what the number you were referencing on the credit side, we've typically been at about 11% or 12% of Open Trading revenue. So when we talk about clearing costs and some of the commentary I've made on past calls that we thought we could drive that percentage, clearing cost to percentage of revenue down into the single digits. I'm getting - we're providing a little more clarity now saying that if you look out on a per ticket basis, which is really a better way of looking at the clearing cost on a per ticket basis, we think we can drive those clearing costs down by upwards of 30%. If you translate that into percentage that say and we can drive it down into 6% or 7% of Open Trading revenue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the fee for million, which, obviously, continues to come in very strong. You mentioned yield to maturity increasing. But just curious about sustainability and maybe update on October, if there's been any real change in terms of behavior on the activity side?
Tony DeLise: Yes. So Dan, on the question on where can it go? The - on the high-grade side, there's a lot of factors that influence fees per million. We've got duration, which is influenced by years to maturity and yields. You've got trade size under our tiered fee plan. We've got dealer mix. We have dealers on distribution fee plans on all variable plans. And even on the protocol side, there are differences between disclosed RFQ, Open Trading, live markets, so there's a lot that goes into the mix, yes. What I would tell you, when you look at the third quarter, this is not a post-crisis high. We've seen years to maturity above 10 years post-crisis. We've seen if you go back to 2009, 2010, 2011, you had U.S. high-grade fee capture hovering around $200 per million. So it's tough to say where it's going to go. In terms of sensitivities, we've talked about this before, every one-year change in years to maturity, plus or minus $10 per million, if you had a one percentage point change in yields across the yield curve could be $10-plus or minus either way. So there's just a lot of variables into the mix. But right now with where yields are, clients are tending to trade longer-dated paper. We're doing better from a market share standpoint. We are doing better and longer-dated paper up. So I don't think any of us know where it's going to go, but a lot of factors that could influence one way or another.
Rick McVey: In this month, Tony?
Tony DeLise: Oh, sorry. In this month - so Dan, you asked about this month be captured. We're 15 days into a 60-month - a 60-day quarter, so early in the quarter. When you look at fee capture, I'm going to give it to you overall for credit, it is almost identical to what we're seeing in the third quarter. Now that's an overall credit number. I'm not going to get any more granular than that, but we're not seeing a big move in fee capture in these first 15 or 16 days.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ken Hill: Hi, good Morning. So I had a question on the regulatory reporting hub you announced you'd be acquiring from Deutsche Borse. Can you talk about how that's going to be worked into pre-trade or pre- and post-trade data services? I think you'd mentioned it increases the footprint with European clients, provides opportunity for technology solutions. So kind of hoping you could maybe flesh those out a little bit. And then maybe anything you can provide on profitability because I don't believe the expenses for that are in the forward guidance moving forward here. Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Great, thanks. And I'll take the first part of that question. Obviously, we're acquiring the arm and APA regulatory reporting business from Deutsche Borse. We do expect that deal to accelerate our margin expansion in the post-trade business. Obviously, it does add data into our footprint within our data business. The real value of that deal is how it scales exceptionally well onto our current platform. There are close to 500 clients within the Deutsche Borse's Reg Reporting Hub. And we plan to transition clients over a 12- to 18-month process. With some initial costs in the build for our platform to allow that many clients to migrate over during that time frame, but largely only adding minimal expenses to our overall platform to support the ongoing business migrating over from the Deutsche Borse Reg Hub. So we're excited about not only the current business, but also the opportunity to upsell those clients with additional services and obviously, extract the value of the data that all their data reporting can bring in the future. I'll let Tony just add any details on some of the costs.
Tony DeLise: So, from a - Ken, I'll give you a little bit of color on both the revenue side and the cost side. On the revenue side, this business will add, year one, somewhere around $10 million in revenue. And as Chris mentioned, fairly high margins expected on that business, it's transitioning over there. That client base, there are some costs upfront to move through that transition, but we would expect this to be a fairly high-margin acquisition, upwards of 50% margins on it. And we have to add on the amortization of acquired intangibles, but purely on an accretion basis, it will be accretive year one.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ari Ghosh: Good morning, everyone. Maybe a quick one for Rick, on the high-yield business. So you hit record market share last quarter, and it seems like these gains appear to be driven by several factors here, including more ETF activity, you've got a higher, probably high-yield names in the mix now from fallen angel, you also - it seems like you have new market participants creating a different slice. So can you talk about the portion here that might be a little more transitory in terms of volumes and share versus just an addressable market that's larger for you guys as a result of some of the organic initiatives?
Rick McVey: Sure, happy to do that. Clearly, Open Trading is a key part of the high-yield liquidity solution that we deliver to clients. And that is not only improving the overall investor-client experience, it's also attracting more new market participants into our high-yield platform and more broadly into Open Trading. So you see a really healthy dynamic there where transaction cost savings are increasing investor-client order flow and new participants are very active in our high-yield product and as you point out, it's been growing hand in glove with the ETF marketplace in high-yield share trading. So those dynamics, I think, are sustainable. The other part that we're seeing is there's actually increased comfort with larger trade sizes going through the platform and high-yield as well. For a long time, our high-yield business has been dominated by trade sizes under $1 million. We're seeing really good adoption and trends coming in the $1 million to $5 million category in high yield as well. So it's a combination of our client comfort with trading larger size and high yield, the transaction cost savings and the new market participants that are active on the high-yield platform.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.
Chris Allen: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the muni business. I wonder if you could give us an update in terms of how current activity is on the platform electronification trends there. And then maybe some details on MuniBrokers, how that's going to help enhance your platform? Any colors on - any call on revenue and expenses around that deal? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Sure. Chris, I'll take that. On the muni business, obviously, I think a year ago, I was talking about our muni business and the excitement around it and certainly, if we look at this quarter, muni revenue grew 37% to $2.5 million in Q3 over Q3 2019. A key factor in the growth of our muni business, particularly in the tax-exempt muni businesses, our Open Trading solution. Obviously, Open Trading in munis grew by over 60%. So we're seeing a lot of that growth being driven by the Open Trading solution. Our penetration in Open Trading, for Open Trading in munis is close to 60% in our tax-exempt muni volume. So certainly, Open Trading is playing a key role in the growth drivers of our muni business. Obviously, we're adding more functionality, more dealers. We also launched the MTF in Europe for munis. So European clients can now access our munis through our MTF, which is a fairly important solution for European clients looking to access the U.S. muni market. On the deals - on the deal itself, MuniBrokers, obviously, it's a small deal, but an exciting one for our muni business. MuniBrokers is an electronic marketplace that currently supports 14 of the leading interdealer brokers and close to $400 million in taxable and tax-exempt volume going across the platform. It is an aggregator of muni content. And that's an important part of the strategy around MuniBrokers acquisition. It's that content that's so important to us, as we look at the content on our current MarketAxess platform. So a lot of the integration of the MuniBrokers platform will be around linking the two platforms together and making use of the content in both platforms to grow overall volumes on both platforms. With regards to the MuniBrokers cost and the deal expenses, I'll let Tony answer that.
Tony DeLise: Yes. So on MuniBrokers, as Chris mentioned, a fairly small company today, largely a subscription model. So we - I'd say we have some clear visibility on both of the transactions, clear visibility on what the revenue outlook is in the near-term. On MuniBrokers, it's - revenue for next year will be somewhere in that $5 million or $6 million or $7 million range. And the expenses will be a couple of million dollars, excluding amortization of intangibles. And just - we've talked about the Deutsche Borse deal, we've talked about MuniBrokers. And just to be clear, so we're not having to add up the pieces. We're looking at a revenue contribution next year somewhere in the $15 million to $17 million range. When you look at expenses inclusive of amortization of intangibles, it's probably $10 million or $11 million in expenses for the two deals in the aggregate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. So I have a multipart question related to live markets. I guess, first, can you give us a sense of the pipeline and the timeline for onboarding of other market makers and how many market makers you think you ultimately have in the platform? Secondly, in terms of pricing, could you help us think about where this is going to be priced relative to your standard RFQ protocol? And lastly, can you just remind us how big the story bond market - or the story bond new issue, the more active market is as a percentage of the total secondary market and what your current market share is? Sorry about the multi-part.
Chris Concannon: Okay. So three questions in one question. I'll jump on the live markets and what we're doing with dealers and market makers. Obviously, we announced the Goldman Sachs relationship on live markets where they'll be streaming live prices and are streaming today live prices currently across 132 bonds, most of the - most active bonds that we carry on the platform. Average sizes are around $500,000 per order, and its two-way streaming prices, so a full - a bit in an offer across all those bonds. That's an exciting announcement for us in that partnership, but we do expect others to join. Right now, there are close to 300 clients approved for live markets and 17 dealers approved for live markets. We expect a number of large dealers to connect to live markets for streaming pricing as well, and those plans are already in the work. So we're excited about what that market will look like in this quarter and into early next year, given the excitement from the dealer community and the dealer community is both large bank and non-bank ETF market makers that are excited about live pricing. The other exciting thing about live markets is a completely different dynamic. It is a click to trade solution, so you can click against those live prices, but more importantly, you can - a client can join the live prices trade at midpoint, add on either side of the market. So it does facilitate clients avoiding the cost of cost crossing spread. It facilitates clients leaving live orders available for execution. So it's really the dynamic of both the streaming liquidity coming from committed market makers as well as clients being able to use the live order book. With regard to pricing, Tony, do you want to cover that?
Tony DeLise: So on the pricing side, we have different fee schedules for each product and protocol. And those fee schedules are typically set based on bid-offer spread. And the expectation around live markets, it will be - trading will tend to favor more on the liquid bonds and even larger trade sizes that have a tighter bid-offer spread. It's also a model where to promote liquidity, it's a liquidity taker pay model or market model to promote liquidity. We're incorporating some incentives or rebates for liquidity providers. So the capture rate is going to be lower than our headline, high-grade fee capture. And again, not exactly sure where that will settle out once we're actively trading in live markets, but as we've said in the past, we view this as largely additive revenue since our share today in that addressable market tends to be lower. And Kyle, you asked that third part of the question around what is the addressable market? And then what's our share in that addressable market. When we look at newly issued bonds, say, the first four weeks of trading, it typically runs around 10% to 15% of trace volume. Second quarter was much bigger than that with a new issuance, but if you look at, you say, the third quarter or which was a more normalized from a new issue standpoint, it's in that 10% to 15% range. The other piece where live markets is addressing is story bonds, actively traded bonds. Any given month or quarter, that could be another 10% to 15% of the addressable market. So you're looking at something like 20% or 25% where this is really targeted. Our share - as you know, our share tends to be lower in those newly issued bonds and most actively traded bonds. And I'll give you one - just one statistic would be in that first week of trading, where it's probably the most obvious one in that first week of trading. After new issue breaks, our market share is around 7%, 7.5%. It's up from where it was a year ago, which is around 5%, but right now, it's around 7% or 7.5%. So you're not - obviously, a lot different than what you see in our market share for seasoned bonds. So this is why this protocol is so important to us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. First, on live markets. Do you view live markets as creating new liquidity in the market and helping secondary market turnover? Or is it a more efficient way to trade we are already pretty liquid bonds? And then secondly, maybe just an update on your market share of block trades 5 million or above.
Rick McVey: So on live markets, it's - honestly, it's both, right? We are aggregating new liquidity, streaming liquidity in the credit market is new at institutional sizes. While there are retail platforms out there that provide live liquidity, this is new because it's institutional size with institutional access. So it's a new type of liquidity that we are placing on the platform. It also allows, as I mentioned, clients to provide liquidity as well. So it's an efficient way for clients to provide liquidity outside of the traditional RFQ solutions and responding to RFQs because it's always live and available for a client to post. So, it is - we view it as new liquidity. Obviously, it is more efficient to use a click to trade solution to access in seconds a quote versus running an RFQ. So the efficiency is great. It also is attractive to some of the new participants that we see coming into our market. Obviously, hedge funds and quant funds are much more attracted to an order-based platform versus an RFQ based platform. So in that respect, it is attracting new liquidity given the new participants that we see accessing our market.
Chris Concannon: And then, Chris, on the market share for block trading, it was right around 10.5%, which was just about the same as it was a year ago. But when you look under the hood, the encouraging part there, our market share in longer-dated paper, in block trades was up. Where we saw a little decline was in short-dated paper. But if I - on short-dated paper, block trades, our market share is 26%, and it was down a little bit. So there's a little bit of an offset there. There's - you could see with the years to maturity, a little - there's less trading, at the shorter end of the curve. Market share was down a little bit, but the long-dated paper market share was up.
Rick McVey: I would just conclude, Chris, by saying that there are many reasons to be optimistic about long-term turnover and velocity in global credit markets. Clearly, open trading is reducing transaction costs but also bring many new and important market participants into credit. And then the stats that Chris shared earlier on the significant growth in automation with dealers embracing algos and clients embracing Auto-X feeds into the mix and our thoughts on velocity. And then the important trend that's going on with the indexation of fixed income and the growth in ETF assets, that really creates a new basket tradable form of fixed income trading and not only creates more activity in the ETF shares, it creates more activity in the underlying bonds. So when we put all that together, we start to see a positive story emerging on long-term growth in market turnover and trade velocity in the years ahead.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein: Great. Good morning, thanks for the question So Rick, maybe just building on that last point. I was hoping you guys could provide a little bit of color on the composition of the Open Trading book. Obviously, that's been a very strong growth driver for you guys. But maybe a little bit of color on sort of the mix of liquidity providers that are in there today versus maybe a year ago, so it sort of kind of what's more systematic or "high-frequency trading" market makers versus some of the traditional players? And any color on the relative size of trades in the Open Trading book versus the rest of the credit platform?
Rick McVey: Sure, happy to do so. The good news is as all aspects of open trading are growing. And I'm especially encouraged when you see our dealer initiated volume continue to grow, where we think we're providing an attractive liquidity outlet and solution and additive distribution for the dealers on MarketAxess, as they think about sitting in the middle of more client trades and doing so with less balance sheet, we're also seeing movement with long-only investors providing more liquidity and you see records on both sides with dealers initiating orders and investors responding to orders and being price providers on the platform. There is an important trend in terms of the percentage of Open Trading volumes still emerging with the new market participants. And each quarter, we've not only seen more new names, we see existing participants getting larger. So there is a trend within liquidity provision where those alternative market makers and liquidity providers continue to get larger as a percentage of the total.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is the follow-up from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.
Richard Repetto: Yes. Rick, so one question on market structure. And I know you sit on the fixed income market advisory committee. Could you tell - there was some recommendations to - for the SEC to have a regulatory framework for electronic fixed income trading as well as to define what electronic trade is. And I guess, could you sort of to summarize what the purpose of that was and what changes that might occur if they adopted the proposal of this FIMSAC committee?
Rick McVey: Sure. No, happy to, Rich. Thanks for the question. But we're about three years into our work as an industry advisory group with the SEC on FIMSAC. And really pleased that Jay Clayton and their commission took the initiative to invite the industry and to advise them on areas where the regulatory environment could be improved in fixed income to help with market transparency and liquidity and resiliency and really some important recommendations have emerged from all the subcommittees over the last three years. This particular one has to do with the fact that today, there really is not one common regulatory framework across all fixed income electronic trading venues. And as a subset of that, there really are not any clear reporting standards for reporting volumes in fixed income electronic trading. And I personally believe that the committee supported that view that there's room for improvement there that would benefit all market participants if we can move toward a common framework for regulation in general and for electronic trading volume reporting specifically. And what's unfortunate today, Rich, is I think many people assume that when they see a press release from one venue that they can compare it directly with others, and that's just not true. Every venue has unique practices in terms of how they report their volumes. And there are tons of inconsistencies that emerge. Some are reporting through ATS, others are not. Some report single dealer volume with multi-dealer volume, some are reporting trade processing with electronic volumes. So it makes it very difficult for analysts, for investors, for dealers and even for the regulators to know exactly what the trends are in fixed income electronic trading in general and within individual venue specifically. And so the recommendation was really, why can't we create standards that would make everybody's job easier to really understand what's going on with electronic market share and transaction costs across the industry. And we're hoping with that, that we'll get to something that looks more standard, but it's anything about that today. And I just would also point out that there is work going on in the private industry to help dissect the various reports. And I would point to Kevin McPartland and Greenwich Associates for the work that they do because they try to really talk to all the venues to understand what they're reporting. And then equally important, they have an industry advisory group themselves. They describe their experiences and how the different venues work and what they are reporting. So they're trying to aggregate all that information into a standardized monthly report now. And I would - I think what they're doing is that - is the best thing that's available now to get through all these differences that exist currently.
Richard Repetto: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Yes, just a couple of follow-ups for Tony. Just on the self-clearing, I think you mentioned that over $200 million of cash has moved over to support the self-clearing operations. Can you just give that number again and talk about whether you'd expect that level of cash to have to grow with Open Trading or whether that will be more fixed in nature?
Tony DeLise: Right. Yes. So Kyle, we're - a couple of things in the mix there. So we've always consciously held excess capital in our regulated entities. And that's really to help clients get comfortable when they opt to trade through us. And it's also to cover any potential credit losses. We haven't incurred any credit losses, but we've always kept excess capital there. The big item now is we're also holding excess capital. We have capital and use right now to meet any liquidity needs and any potential spike in Open Trading activity or volatility or any sort of activity from our clearing experience. On self-clearing, it doesn't impact our minimum regulatory capital requirement, but there's a big uplift in regulatory reporting and our daily position monitoring, these new deposit and reserve requirements. So we've got a customer reserve with FINRA. We have deposit requirements with the clearing houses and our settlement agent banks. And also, we're putting money at use to facilitate trading at DTC. Today, those numbers aggregate around $260 million. That could change. Again, it could change with Open Trading activity. It could change if there's volatility, it could change if our settlement experience changes. But right now, we feel like we have sufficient capital to meet the needs. The broker dealer's already well capitalized. We also have a $200 million collateralized loan available with our settlement agent. We have our revolving credit facility at the parent company level. So we think we're more than sufficiently capitalized. We also - just to put it in perspective, we ran some simulations around the activity in March, where our Open Trading activity was elevated. It was two times where it was in the third quarter. Volatility spiked for a number of weeks there, particularly in March. And even with the estimated increase in our deposit and reserve requirements, we think it's all manageable within our current capital profile. So again, we think - short answer is we think we're sufficiently positioned from a capital standpoint, even if we see spikes in volume or volatility.
Kyle Voigt: Got it, thanks. And then just lastly, the distribution fees, you mentioned, I think there was one dealer migration, but there's also an increase due to unused minimums. Was the majority of the sequential increase related to the dealer migration? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is sustainable on a run rate basis? Thanks.
Tony DeLise: Yes. Yes, sure, Kyle. So it was more weighted toward the unused minimum fees. And just in terms of sort of caution around guidance, we do give dealers the choice of fee plants, in particular, in U.S. high-grade and high yield. We have a distribution fee plan, we have all variable plans. And then most products have a dealer monthly minimum fee commitment. So because we give dealers choices and because the unused minimum fees can vary period-to-period based on activity, it's hard to pin down the forward-looking forecast. But right now, we aren't tracking any dealer movement in the fourth quarter. We're not tracking any fee plan changes. So we would expect the fourth quarter distribution fees to be similar to the third quarter with one caveat, and that's around these unused minimum fees. So that could cause a swing from period-to-period. But from, say, the pure distribution fee line, the fixed monthly fees, we don't expect any change there into the fourth quarter.
Kyle Voigt: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thanks very much for joining us this morning. And stay safe, stay healthy, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on July 22, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter. Chris Concannon, President and COO, will discuss automation and our trading volume. And then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter 2020 results. Our second quarter results reflect accelerating market share gains, robust credit market volumes and a global shift among dealers and investors toward fixed income trading automation. Revenues were up 47% to $185 million on the back of 44% increase in fully electronic trading volume versus Q2 ‘19. Earnings per share of $2.20 was up 73% year-over-year. Operating margins reached a new record of 56.4%, up from 48.5% last year. Record new issue activity contributed to the increase in market volumes during the quarter. Estimated market share on MarketAxess bucked the normal trend during the quarter with accelerated share gains in spite of the heavy new issue calendar. U.S. high grade estimated share jumped to a record 21.5% during the quarter, up from 18.7% and U.S. high yield estimated share grew to 14%, up from 10.4%. Open Trading volume grew to a new record of $241 billion in Q2, up 87%. With significantly higher volatility and price dispersion during the quarter, Open Trading estimated transaction cost savings reached a new record of $312 million, exceeding company revenues for the second quarter in a row. The value proposition to our clients has never been more clear as we deliver substantial transaction costs savings, essential new market liquidity and greater trading efficiency. I'm also thrilled to announce the appointment of Kourtney Gibson, President of Loop Capital to our Board of Directors. Kourtney's breadth of experience in both equity and fixed income markets and her investor-client relationships, will bring valuable perspective to our company. Slide 4 highlights market conditions. Market volumes measured by TRACE remain high due to the combination of higher credit spread volatility and record new issue volume. Since the COVID-19 market conditions started on February 24th, high grade average daily TRACE volumes have increased 28% and high yield is up 12% versus the levels earlier this year. New issue volumes are at record levels with high grade issuance of $691 billion in Q2, up 150% year-over-year. Credit spreads peaked in March and declined throughout the second quarter, following the fed announcements on liquidity programs. Credit downgrades continued in the second quarter. Year-to-date, approximately $196 billion of high grade debt has been downgraded to high yield. While credit spread volatility has fallen from extreme levels in March, our expectation is that it is likely spread volatility will remain higher than normal in the quarters ahead due to the increased economic uncertainty that is likely to be with us for some time to come. Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading delivered essential liquidity to market participants throughout the last four months. During the second quarter, Open Trading grew at 33% of our trading volume, up from 25% one year ago. On average, our Open Trading marketplace had 32,000 orders and over $18 billion in notional value available per day for trading. Dealer initiated orders into Open Trading reach record volumes during the quarter, and investors reach new records for providing liquidity on the system. We believe this robust all to all marketplace represents a substantial improvement in fixed income market structure, which is most evident during volatile times. Unlike the challenging experience in credit trading in 2008, market turnover actually increased throughout this recent credit event, demonstrating that new innovations in fixed income markets are creating important new tools for risk transfer in secondary markets. There are encouraging signs that credit market turnover or trading velocity is increasing. Open Trading is creating opportunities for new market participants, leading to record active client firms with over 1,500 institutional firms completing open trades during the quarter. These new participants are important contributors to the Open Trading liquidity pool in credit products. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on automation and our trading volumes.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick. Slide 6 demonstrates the growing momentum of automation and credit trading. Automated trading volumes rose to over $32 billion in the second quarter, up from $19.3 billion in the second quarter of 2019. 83 firms used our auto execution functionality in the second quarter, up from 55 the prior year. The average trade size conducted through Auto-X is also rising. In the second quarter, the average trade size using our Auto-X functionality grew to $222,000 versus $184,000 the year prior. Clients continue to increase the size of their orders as they gain comfort with the execution quality of our Auto-X solution. The use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform, with approximately 3.5 million algo responses in the second quarter resulting in over 300,000 trades. Despite recent market volatility, we continue to see strong growth in our automated trading solutions, as both investors and dealer clients look to improve their trading efficiency. Inquiry volume and count reach new highs, demonstrating greater willingness to automate trading work flows. Slide 7 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high grade volumes were up 56% year over year to $415 billion for the quarter, largely due to market share gains and the increase in market volumes. Estimated U.S. high grade market share increased by 2.8 percentage points year over year to 21.5%, while estimated U.S. high grade TRACE volumes were up 36% year over year. Our other credit category volume was up 32% year over year, led again by significant growth in U.S. high yield trading over our platform. U.S. high yield volume was up 85% as estimated market share reached a record 14% and estimated TRACE market volumes rose 37%. Our emerging markets and euro bond volume each grew double digits in the second quarter with virtually all of those gains due to higher estimated market share. We also had another solid quarter of trading in the municipal bonds. In the second quarter 315 unique client and dealer firms traded $3.2 billion in municipal bonds on the platform, up 93% from the prior year. Our rates business maintained its revenue and market share as compared to Q2 2019, and we are continuing to invest in new rates trading solutions. We are excited about the successful launch of our quick-to-trade client solution during the second quarter, and our client onboarding for this unique solution is very encouraging. Also, our treasury auto hedging solution recently crossed $2.8 billion in volume since launch, and hit a record of close to $1 billion in volume during the month of June. We also plan to launch our net hedging solution during the third quarter of 2020. Our green bond trading initiative continues to support clients’ ESG-related investment mandates. In the second quarter, over $6 billion worth of green bonds were traded on our platform, resulting in over 30,000 trees being planted in critical regions across the world. We have now planted over 60,000 trees since the beginning of the year. Before providing color on July, please note that there are eight trading days remaining in the month. July market volumes have declined from Q2 levels as they often do around the 4th of July holiday. At this point in the month, July Trace volumes for high-grade and high-yield look similar to last July, and our high-grade estimated market share is running similar to Q2 levels and our high-yield estimated market share is running above Q2 levels. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 8, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall, revenue was a record $185 million, up 47% year-over-year. 44% increase in credit trading volume and the inclusion of U.S. treasury trading resulted in 51% uplifting commissions. Information services revenue was up 18% in the second quarter and includes one-time data sales of approximately $600,000. Operating income was up 71% year-over-year. The leverage in our model came through clearly in the second quarter with operating margins, expanding to a record 56% while we continued to invest in a variety of growth initiatives. The effective tax rate was 19.7% in the second quarter and reflects $5.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. We expect that the full year effective tax rate will be near the lower end of the guidance range of 20%. Our diluted EPS was a record $2.20. The year-over-year increase in our diluted share count was largely due to the 146,000 shares issued as part of the LiquidityEdge acquisition. On Slide 9, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transactions fees were up 61% year-over-year, driven by the increase in credit trading volume, higher U.S. high-grade fee capture and the inclusion of U.S. treasury trading commissions. U.S. high-grade fee per million was $5 higher on a sequential basis and $20 higher year-over-year, mainly due to longer duration. Average years for maturity on bonds traded over the platform hit nine years in the recent quarter compared to 7.8 years in the second quarter of 2019. Our other credit category fee per million increased by $6 on a sequential basis and $15 year-over-year, principally due to a shift among products favoring high-yield volume. Fee capture at the individual product level was very similar to the first quarter. Rates fee per million of $4.02 was slightly higher than Q1. Both U.S. treasury fee capture and agencies fee capture were similar for the first quarter levels. As a reminder, there could be some variability in our rates fee capture due to volume tiering under our treasury fee plans. Total distribution fees were $700,000 lower than the first quarter level. One U.S. high grade dealer and one U.S. high yield dealer transitioned from distribution fee plans to variable fee plans during the second quarter. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. On a year-over-year basis, expenses were up 25% for the quarter with compensation and benefits accounting for close to 60% of the year-over-year change. The main contributors to the rise in compensation benefits with an increase in headcount of 81 personnel in support of our growth initiatives and an uplift in the variable bonus provision, which is tied to financial performance. Clearing costs more than doubled year-over-year, reflecting the 87% increase in Open Trading volume and the inclusion of match principle treasury trading volume. The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development and the trading platform along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. The biggest factor influencing the increase in technology and communication costs with higher software licensing fees, some of which are tied to trading activity. And the uplift in professional consulting costs is largely tied to higher recruiting fees. We expect that full year 2020 expenses will end up near the high end of our guidance range of $314 million. Among other items, the most sensitive factor to our expense forecasts is the level of credit market volumes, which impact variable line items such as clearing costs and incentive pay. We are assuming that credit market volumes are likely to decline in the second half of the year. On Slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of June 30th were $536 million and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached a record $280 million. During the second quarter, we paid the quarterly cash dividend of $23 million. We also repurchased 37,000 shares in total during the quarter, including 13,000 shares under our buyback program and 24,000 shares associated with the exercise or vesting of employee stock awards. We are approaching the go live dates for our U.S. and UK clearing and settlement initiatives. We believe that our regulated businesses that handle match principle trading have sufficient liquidity and capital to cover any new deposit or reserve requirements. We also do not anticipate any change in our shareholder capital return programs. Based on the second quarter results, our board has approved a $0.60 regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the record results we delivered during the second quarter. It is encouraging to see the acceleration of market share gains during these extreme conditions in credit markets. I want to thank our clients for supporting our vision for an open marketplace, our shareholders for believing in us and our employees for their dedication to allow their company to thrive throughout this health and economic crisis. We wish you all the best and hope that we are on the right path to a full recovery in the coming quarters. We would now be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: I guess my question is around automation, and great results on the Open Trading and as well as the automated trading. And I guess my question is around market data and I've heard from past panels and from calls, the importance of market data to continue to grow the automated trading. And so could you give us an update, either Rick or Chris on the market data offering and how important it is and I'd also like to find out why Chris hasn't wrestled more this $312 million of savings from Open Trading back to MarketAxess?
Rick McVey: Well, I was planning on talking about that savings, Rich, because it's unbelievable that a company of our size can deliver that much savings in a quarter where the savings actually dwarfs our revenues. So when clients see that savings, obviously, they are migrating to the platform. But to answer your question directly, you're absolutely right, Rich. Market data is a key component of automation. If you look at all the automation innovations, both here at MarketAxess and elsewhere in the industry, this highly dependent on very solid, accurate market data and price information. And it has to be real time in order for the automation to truly succeed. If you look at our roll out of our automated trading solutions and our pipeline of new initiatives around those tools, they are all linked to our wildly successful CP+ market data feed. So, that is a critical part of our automation strategy, both in terms of how to price the instrument as a guide for clients but also as risk parameters to protect them against large market moves while they have automation launch. So we have a number of risk controls using that unique market data that is AI supported market data. So to answer your question, we're continuing to advance our automation solutions. Things like Auto Responder is critically dependent on our CP+ data feeds and helping clients to automate how they become a passive liquidity provider in the credit market. I hope this answers your question.
Rich Repetto: Yes, but what about the 312, the wrestling of the 312…
Rick McVey: We'll happily provide that back to our clients.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Thanks for the update on the capability side of the algo. Maybe this is from both Rick and Chris here. Obviously, it seems like Open Trading and trade automation are kind of critical to the market share gains that you guys have had here today. It looks like both the number of firms, as well as the volumes went higher. So, I guess from a client perspective, given the unique working circumstances that we're in doing the virus. Can you maybe just give us some color on the outlook for cementing both Open Trading and automation into trading work flows from maybe both a new user and deepening wallet share perspective? And then also just kind of wondering if you see any slackening engagements in either of these systems this past month or so since some large dealers and asset managers have had traders move back into the office?
Rick McVey: Sure. I'm happy to start and quick Chris can follow up as well. But the beauty of our Open Trading solution is its simplicity. And we’ve really leveraged the broad base of institutional order flow that we have on the platform to create an open network where more people can participate in that order flow. And, I do think that the share gains first half of this year are largely attributable to the benefits that we see from the open marketplace; first, the cost savings that we've mentioned; and secondly, by expanding market participation. And virtually every quarter we see growing activity from a growing base of alternative market makers who are committing new capital to the credit markets. We see growing activity from ETF market participants. It's interesting to note when you look at the second quarter, ETF high yield share trading was up 52%, very close to our own overall trading growth. So, we're growing hand in glove with the ETF industry as well. And that base of market participants has been enabled for a new way of trading through Open Trading. We're also starting to see very positive signs from quantitative fund strategies, which historically have not been active in credit. And then finally, I’d point to growth that we're seeing in the hedge fund client segment, which is relatively new as well. So, when you look at the volume and share gains for the first half of the year, it is a very healthy combination of more volume with existing clients and new entrants into credit markets, which also then drives our optimism about market turnover. On your other point about work from home, there's no question that that has created a tailwind for electronic trading just out of necessity. Moving away from trading floors into a home office, it's much easier to connect with global liquidity electronically than it is any other way. However, given the results that we're delivering to our clients, we personally don't see that going back to where it was as clients return to their office environments. And this quarter, we do see some gradual return among dealers to their trading floors. Although, it's still at relatively low levels but asset managers continue to trade primarily from home. And our belief based on lots of conversations is that that is likely to stay with us through the second half of this year.
Chris Concannon: And Rick, I'll just add on the automation front. We continue to see high levels of usage, not only today but it's consistent with the trend line growth that we were experiencing prior to the crisis and the work from home. And it's really a work flow efficiency demand that we're seeing from our large institutional clients. If you look at the size of the credit market and how large its recently grown, the challenges continue to get more complicated to source liquidity and to execute both large and small sized trades. So, the work flow demands certainly are leading to a higher adoption rate of our automation solutions, both our Auto-X and our Auto Responder. And I would say it's still early days on Auto Responder, given some of the feature set that we have coming in the third and fourth quarter, things like high-yield, better enhanced OMS integration and even EM being launched on our Auto Responder. The other piece of automation that we're excited about, we plan to launch our first client algos in credit in the second half of this year closer towards the end of the year. That's a unique offering where we're not only using our automated solutions but we're wrapping orders together into a very sophisticated client algorithm for large institutional clients to use. So, we're excited about the innovation that's coming in the second half of the year around automation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Maybe just a question on the fed primary and secondary market corporate bond facilities. Just when we’re thinking about the direct and indirect impact from these. I guess first question, have you seen any fed buying directly on your platform? I'm not sure if that's happening for the dealers or BlackRock or something else. And then on just the fed facilities more broadly and in an indirect way. Do you think they're already helping to compress credit spreads and credit spread volatility? And if so, could that be a headwind to market turnover and the velocity of trade?
Rick McVey: Kyle, I'll take a crack at that. But first of all, we would never comment on any individual client activity on our platform. So, we don't have the liberty to answer your question about fed activity electronically and I would refer you to your corporate bond trading desk and others for further color on that. I think the fed has had an active role in the recovery of credit markets over the last four months. Most importantly, the short-term liquidity programs back in March and early April that unlock financing markets that really started the march toward more normal credit spreads that we observed throughout the second quarter. What you see in the media is consistent with our understanding is that the fed has been active in both ETFs and corporate bonds but the levels are not outsized. And the reality is that with the changes in the liquidity and financing markets, the credit markets did a really good job recovering themselves. And asset managers saw inflows through the quarter that they were putting to work, which caused credit spreads to compress significantly throughout the quarter. So, I think the fed is there when needed. It's clear that they have a vested interest in the capital markets and the cost of funding through this crisis, and they've had an impact on helping credit markets get back on their feet, which then allowed corporations to issue $700 billion in high-grade debt in one quarter. So, they definitely have made a difference there. With respect to secondary trading, I don't think their activity has been outsized versus normal market participants.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ari Ghosh: Maybe just looking back to your comments around Open Trading. The value prop right now around liquidity cost saves that's fairly playing out nicely and driving rather auto activity, share gains and new firms from the platforms. So we already seen that. And I think you touched on this a little. But curious if you can just bar some of these recent share gains? How much of this is more environmental driven that could potentially dissipate on a more normal backdrop versus greater utilization from either under penetrated clients or regions, be it [Technical Difficulty] participation, APAC something like that that could end up being a lot more sticky. So, just trying to ascertain if these elevated levels should be viewed almost as higher reset level driven by diversity going forward with the platform?
Rick McVey: It's a good point. There's no question that the cost savings from Open Trading benefited from extreme volatility during the quarter, and the much wider price dispersion the clients observed in levels coming back on order flow in any form. So, I do think that the cost savings will ebb and flow based on volatility and price dispersion in each quarter. Having said that, we are confident that our Open Trading marketplace is unique. 95% of the order flow that I mentioned comes from institutional order flow and about 5% from dealer-initiated orders, and that's creating a tremendous opportunity for not only alternative market makers but also for institutional investors to find more matching opportunities per day and drive their transaction cost down on a consistent basis. So, we do believe that this is a long-term benefit to fixed income market structure. And it's great to see dealers embracing it more actively as well for their own liquidity with the levels of dealer initiated order flow where they can end up transacting either with an end client or another dealer on those orders. And it's nice to see that the profitability of MarketAxess is growing while at the same time, the dealers had very good quarters as well, which reflects how big these markets are. And we do think that longer term you're going to continue to see market share gains and increased market participation that will deliver transaction cost savings back to our clients for many years to come.
Chris Concannon: And I would just say that Open Trading has a wonderful network effect that we're seeing play out in not only high yield and high grade but obviously in EM where we're seeing participants that normally don't match with one another are able to match inside the all to all market. So, the network effect of Open Trading will continue to grow and participants are benefiting greatly by that network effect.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from Ken Hill of Rosenblatt. Your line is open.
Ken Hill: You mentioned earlier I think on the Auto-X side as far as the trades kind of moving into the larger scale kind of trade showing more confidence in that offering. Is there any sort of level you're seeing where clients maybe start to pull back or become more uncomfortable there? And what are the things you're looking at to kind of break down those barriers, is it more information driven or is it more liquidity there?
Rick McVey: It's really client comfort. We see a number of our largest users of automation regularly increasing the size of their orders that they're putting on their lists and loading into automation. And we're providing a great deal of analytics back to them of what is tradable and how liquid some of the products are. So it helps, we're guiding them on how they're finding quality execution at larger size orders across the Auto-X platform. So, we are seeing our biggest users continue to grow their order sizes on the platform. Obviously, I mentioned the launch of a client algo sometime in the second half of the year, that tool is also designed to take larger size orders and break them up into smaller size orders to allow clients to while trade a large size to do it over the course of the day or week in much smaller trade sizes. So we're seeing we're seeing a number of clients grow their own their order size in automation, but we're also trying to cater to those clients that want to trade with a lighter footprint in the market.
Chris Concannon: And I would just add to that. What we are seeing on auto execution with investor clients is mirrored with the dealer community and the increase in size through their algos. So, I do think it reflects confidence in trading automation in the system and it makes both dealers and investors more efficient interacting with order flow on the platform. And in addition to the increase in trade size through Auto-X, it was also interesting through the credit event in Q2 that our overall trade size in U.S. credit increased during the quarter and we had a record quarter for block trading volume. So, you see really positive signs in trading automation and dealer investor confidence. You see more block trades coming into system. Tony mentioned earlier the increase in average maturity in the system. Those are all very positive signs in terms of our clients are now comfortable using the system.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.
Chris Allen: I wanted to ask a question on velocity. Rick, you mentioned earlier that you've seen encouraging size losses increasing. Wondering if you can give us some additional color there? How do they relate to the quant funds you mentioned? And then also where do you think velocity can get to? It's still well below equity levels, not that I would have ever to get there. But where do you think it could possibly approach over the next coming years?
Rick McVey: Prior to bank capital, rate capital reform, it was common to see annual turnover in high grade corporate bonds at 0.95% or 1% of debt outstanding. And we we recently bottomed out at more like 0.65% and we've recently come back up to about 0.7%. So, we're still well below the levels you would see pre-reg reform on capital requirements for the banks. So if I had to target what a reasonable goal would be with the extension of market participants into credit and the benefits of trading automation, and don't forget how important the ETF market is. That was an active part of a solution over the last four months is both dealers and investors using ETF shares for critical liquidity needs, which then intersects with bond trading on MarketAxess. So, I think it's market innovation and it's the increase in market participation is brought about through all trading that's starting to show a brighter picture on market turnover. So, we've bounced from the lows and you think getting back to something that we would have seen prior to 2008 it’s more like 0.95% or 1% turnover per year would be a near term goal.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Could you give us an update on your rough market share within high grade by trade size bucket, and what kind of market share gains did you see in the quarter across each of those buckets?
Rick McVey: So Chris, on the market share side, and I will give you the details. But the market share gains were, we experienced market share gains across all trade sizes and all maturities. And when you look at, if we just broke it up between block trading and non block trading. On the block side, our market share was up about 2.3 percentage points and our overall market share was up at 2.8 percentage points, and then the non block was also up about 2.8 percentage points. So regardless of trade size market share was up. If you looked at a heat map based on maturity, you would see market share up across all maturity sizes as well.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Just couple of follow ups on that, one on just the prior question. Again, you had some pretty impressive market share gains in the quarter, especially on the back of a lot of new issues that came out during the quarter. So kind of by our back, it looks like your market share of new issued bond rating was actually higher than in prior years. I'm wondering one, if that's correct? And then two, if that's true, what do you think this is a bit of a structural shift? So maybe it'd be less of a headwind in future years, or is it maybe more transitory due to the kind of the work from home conditions?
Rick McVey: Yes, I think I would agree with all parts of your comment that we did do better in trading of newly issued bonds during the quarter. And hard to know how much of that was the work from home environment versus a longer term change in behavior. But we also did even better than the high level of share gains when you look at seasoned bonds and trading after the first four weeks. So, a nice combination of both. But our progress on new issues has been encouraging, but we also think this is going to be a perfect place for our new live markets protocol. And that was set back because of the extreme levels of volatility and some of the key market makers that are supporting that initiative, having plenty to deal with through the crisis and the work from home environment. But we continue to hear very encouraging things about new issues and liquid bonds through our live markets protocol, and that's something that we will continue to work on developing during the second half of the year.
Jeremy Campbell: And then Tony, can you just update us on the self clearing initiative for the U.S. market and maybe when that might now be expected to go live and likely to shut down the variable clearing system?
Tony DeLise: So, on the clearing side, right now, we are expecting to transition to self clearing in the U.S. and to a new clearing broker in the UK in the third quarter. It's a little bit later than what we have anticipated but probably understandable, given the pandemic impact on us and on our vendor partners. What we're doing is once we do go live in the third quarter, we do expect clearing costs as a percentage of Open Trading revenue for our credit business to decline. So remember, we have really two components to clearing costs. We have it on our Open Trading credit business. We also have clearing costs on our match principle treasury business as well. What we've talked in the past about what kind of savings we can deliver once we do go live. And typically, clearing costs on the credit side as a percentage of Open Trading revenue have been 11% or 12%, and we do think we could drive that down to the single-digit. It's even more important today because if you look at Open Trading revenue in 2019, our credit revenue was about $100 million. If it goes down, for example, 3 percentage points, that's $3 million in savings. If you look at the first half of this year and we're on $170 million run rate for Open Trading revenue. So, the cost savings are much more significant given what we're pushing through Open Trading today. So we've got our go live date targeted right now. And we would expect some savings as we go into say the fourth quarter, we do expect -- that’s part of our expense guidance. We do expect some favoribility on the clearing cost line into the fourth quarter.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Sheriq Sumar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Sheriq Sumar: This is Sheriq filling in for Alex Blostein. Can you update us on the portfolio trading side and like what’s the traction that you’re seeing over there in this quarter, and any color on how the volumes have been for the portfolio trading in 2Q?
Rick McVey: As you recall, we launched our portfolio trading solution near the beginning of the year. We have seen growth in that product. I'll remind you that today 3% of overall trade fund is estimated to be portfolio trade. So, it's still a small subset of the overall market. But most of the portfolio trade solutions are really targeting single dealer solutions that provide more of a trade processing solution and not really a full trading solution. Our trading solution, our portfolio trading solution does both single dealer but also multi dealer. So, you can put your portfolio in competition for price among a number of dealers and that's something that many of our clients find attractive. We are providing additional enhancements in improving how those portfolio trades seamlessly move through processing into the owned assets, which is a critical piece of the portfolio trade. So, since our launch just over $1.3 billion in volume in portfolio trade, there was a slow down, obviously, in portfolio trades during the most recent market volatility given the difficulties in pricing portfolios in a fast moving market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: I just want to get back to the, sort of the impact of issuance in the quarter. And Tony, you've done and I think this sort of mentioned earlier, but a calculation that sort of removes the issuance and sort of normalizes what the market share excluding the issuance. And could you go through that and what you calculate 2Q as? And then also maybe one last thing, the variable fee capture, and it's elevated because of the longer duration. Would you expect that to fall back somewhere between say this quarter and the first quarter? Is that a reasonable rate going forward? How would you view the variable fee capture?
Chris Concannon: So Rich, I can't say I did a whole little science project here on what market share would look with and without the new issues. But well, this is what I can tell you is, when you look at the proportion of TRACE volume that related to newly issued bonds. And let's just take the second quarter. If you look at just the first four weeks of trading, it was about a quarter of TRACE volume related to newly issued bonds. And if you look for any period prior to that it may have been 10% or 11% or 12%. So clearly, the portion of the market related to newly issued bonds increased dramatically. And you look at our market share, our market share gains year-over-year were up, for high grade were up 2.8 percentage points. And again, without getting too scientific, if you’ve pulled out the new issue piece, you would see our market share gains would have been even healthier. On one of the earlier questions that Rick responded to on did our market share go up in newly issued bonds? It did, not appreciably. But if you look at the first four weeks, our market share is typically around 5% or 6%. It was up a little bit but not a lot. So, you see when you do the math around a big increase in the portion of the market that relates to newly issued bonds the market share gains were even healthier. And just on the variable fee capture, there is so many factors and this particularly for high grade that we're talking about. The fee capture for high yield euro bond emerging markets very stable and not duration impacted at all. It’s the U.S. high grade plan where it is dependent on trade size. It is dependent on duration, which is years to maturity and yield. It's dependent on protocol. So, there is a lots of factors that can move it. The item we flagged was on years to maturity. You look over the past 10 years now, the years to maturity is ranged between seven years and 10 years. We're not at the absolute high. We're in the middle of that range, it did extend out a little bit in the second quarter here. Hard to say what will happen going forward. We've given some color in the past that and this is just, if you look it, all else equal, one year change in maturity could move the fee capture by something like $10 to $15 per million. So, if we move from say nine to 10 years, all else equal, fee capture move up, going from nine to eight years fee captures would move down. Tough to just, it's really, really hard to predict though.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Maybe just one just on that point on high-grade fee capture. Was it helped at all by lower yields as well or was that just a negligible impact in the quarter?
Chris Concannon: Kyle, it was much more on the years to maturity, because even though, you're right that yields were lower, spreads were higher, so -- where treasury yields were lower, spread to treasury was higher. So it was much more about the years to maturity. Anything we had a slightly negative offset because we did better in larger trade sizes. Not only our market share was up in larger trade sizes, the average trade size moved up as well. So if there was, more of the offset came from the tearing under our fee plan than it did from yields moving.
Kyle Voigt: And then just another question on the high yield business, just wondering if we can get an update on how sizable the ETF market makers were as a percentage of your high yield volume in 2Q and just wondering how that compares to where that's averaged historically?
Chris Concannon: Kyle, it's not -- I can't say the sort of scientific project around this. We do look at the ETF participants, and typically this is going back over the past five years. The ETF participants for our high yield business have ranged between 15% to 30% of our business. That 30% actually, you may recall, it was the blowout of the energy sector going back almost five years ago now. In the second quarter, that percentage was below 20%. So, what it does show is that our real money business and activity has increased significantly. ETF is critically important to our high yield business. But you're seeing growth from other market participants and clients on the platform as well.
Rick McVey: And I would just add that it's becoming very difficult to target who is an ETF market participant anymore, given the banks have grown their ETF desks dramatically in the credit space. And a number of new participants have come onto the platform. And obviously, we launched an effort late last year to target systematic fund strategies and they do make use of ETF arbitrage strategies and other signal based strategies. So, we've seen a huge growth in the systematic funds side. Just in the second quarter, they traded over 42 billion in volume. So, just a big move in a number of players that use both direct credit but also the ETFs as well.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. You line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Can you speak to the market dynamics in emerging markets right now, the industry wide volumes that you guys track are not up to the extent that U.S. high yield and U.S. high-grade are? And the market share gains have, while positive have not been quite as strong as in some of these other products. So what are you seeing right now in EM?
Chris Concannon: I think parts of the EM market have been a risk off environment for investors over the last couple of quarters, and with some very difficult market conditions in places like Argentina that are important markets for us in EM. So, there is greater caution among investors about adding exposure to emerging markets right now, because of some of the economic difficulties and high debt levels in some of those markets. So, it's not growing the same way that develop credit is right now. I still think it's likely to normalize and get back on track. But as a product area, market volumes have been more muted in EM than what we see in developed market corporate credit.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then can you talk about the market opportunity that you see for your newly launched Dealer Direct tool? And should we think of that tool as comparable to TruMid's Attributed Trade protocol, or is it a different approach?
Chris Concannon: It's a great question. So, we're pretty excited about the dealer feedback on the Dealer Direct Streaming tool. And what's great about it is, it allows dealers to customize streaming liquidity direct to a disclosed client. So, it's a private way to stream liquidity to select clients. So in that regard, it's very similar to the TruMid solution, but it's not identical. The feedback has been positive. Obviously, it leverages APIs for the dealers. So, it's a fairly streamlined set up for them. And it allows the dealers to protect their data as well, the data that they show the clients is only for the client's eyes, we don't aggregate that data into any of our data feeds. So, it is truly a private market, streams private market for select clients.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no other questions in the queue. I’d like to turn it back to Mr. Rick McVey for any closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this quarter and please stay safe and stay healthy, and enjoy the summer months. And we look forward to catching up with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on April 29, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will discuss automation and our operational resilliency; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter.  I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter 2020 results. First, let me start by sending our heartfelt thoughts to all of those suffering through hardship and loss caused by the COVID-19 pandemic around the world. These are extraordinarily difficult times and we hope to begin to see the seeds of recovery in the coming months.  The sharp increase in credit market volatility beginning in late February led to record quarterly credit trading volume on MarketAxess of $660 billion up 29% versus Q1 2019. The value of our leading electronic trading platform was evident in record quarterly volumes for all of our core products, U.S. high-grade, high-yield, emerging markets, and Eurobonds. We also set new volume records in new and important product areas including municipal bonds and U.S. treasuries. High-grade market share was 20% for the quarter up from 17.6% one year ago. Open Trading provided a unique trading conductivity to institutional market participants during the crisis and volumes were a record $209 billion up 55% year-over-year. The acceleration of trading activity led to record financial results as well. Revenues of $169 million were up 36%, operating income jumped 44% and EPS was $1.96 up 41%. Operating leverage came through clearly during the quarter, with operating margins of 54% up from 51%. Slide 4 highlights market conditions. The sharp increase in credit market volatility started during the week of February 24, unlike the global financial crisis in 2008 average daily market volume reported to TRACE increased 27% in high-grade and 24% in high yield in the last five weeks of the quarter. Market share on MarketAxess also jumped higher during the volatile weeks. Unique liquidity available through Open Trading differentiated our platform. Open Trading average daily volume was up 67% in the last five weeks of the quarter versus levels seen before the event. The speed of credit widening in Q1 was far greater than 2008. For example, the high yield spread index jumped from 400 over treasuries to 1,300 over in just four weeks in Q1. That same level of spread widening occurred over 11 months in 2008. We have seen an improvement in credit trading conditions over the last three to four weeks, partly due to the liquidity programs launched by the fed and other central banks. Corporations rushed to issue more debt as markets began to stabilize in late March, leading to a record $480 billion of new high grade debt in the quarter. Many companies also tapped their bank credit lines to improve their liquidity position. It is likely that debt issuance will continue to grow in both the private and public sectors leading to even greater secondary trading opportunities. Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading played a valuable role in keeping global market participants connected for trading throughout this credit event, 1,500 institutional firms utilize the unique Open Trading liquidity available on MarketAxess during the quarter. Open Trading average daily volume grew to a record $3.4 billion, up 53% from a year ago. Open Trading represented 31% of total trading volume for the full quarter, up from 26%. As price dispersion in credit markets exploded in March, Open Trading delivered sharply higher transaction costs, savings to clients. Liquidity taker, estimated savings reached $201 million for the quarter and liquidity providers saved an estimated $87 million. Estimated client transaction cost savings on the trading system exceeded company revenues for the quarter. During the quarter, investment managers reached a new volume record for providing liquidity on MarketAxess and dealers reached a new volume record as liquidity takers. We believe this demonstrates a trading behavior change that will lead to an even better global fixed income market in the years ahead. The Open Trading marketplace is the only broad-based continuous all-to-all electronic market in global fixed income. For the quarter MarketAxess had over 30,000 daily institutional client orders available to both dealers and investors in Open Trading totaling $16 billion in notional value on average per day. We believe we play an important role in improving overall market liquidity and reducing market risk during times like this.  We also believe that our significant competitive lead in electronic credit trading for the institutional market widened even further during the quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on automation and our operational resiliency.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick. Slide 6 demonstrates the growing momentum of automation and credit trading. Automated trading volumes rose to over 31 billion in the first quarter, up from 12.5 billion in the first quarter of 2019, 84 firms used our auto execution functionality in the first quarter up from 52 the prior year. The use of dealer algorithms is also growing with approximately 3 million algo responses in the first quarter, resulting in 249,000 trades.  While we saw a modest reduction in the average number of responses per inquiry, we believe this was largely due to the extreme market volatility in the second half of the quarter. Thus far in April, we have seen algo responses returned to pre-crisis levels. We're seeing a growing adoption of our automated trading tools for both liquidity providers and liquidity takers and we are actively working with both of them on enhancing our functionality.  Slide 7 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 19% year-over-year to 330 billion for the quarter, due almost entirely to an increase in estimated market share, while estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes are up 28% year-over-year in March, market volumes were up marginally year-over-year for the full quarter.  In the other credit category, U.S. high yield emerging markets and Eurobond trading volume were each up 30% or more compared to the first quarter of 2019. U.S. high yield was the standout, up 70% on the heels of record estimated market share of 12.2% coupled with a 25% increase in estimated TRACE market volumes. We're also highly encouraged by the growing adoption of municipal bond trading. In the first quarter 316 unique client and dealer firms traded a record 3.3 billion municipal bond volume on the MarketAxess platform, up 143% from the prior year. Our rates category is mainly composed of trading volume in U.S. Treasuries and reflects the post-acquisition contribution from LiquidityEdge, now known as MarketAxess Rates. On a pro forma basis, average daily volume for U.S. treasuries was up 57% year-over-year. We believe these volume gains were primarily driven by an increase in estimated market share. Our April month-to-date average daily credit volume is tracking more than 35% higher than April 2019, and currently above the Q1 level. I'm also thrilled with the progress we have made with our recently announced green bond trading initiative, which supports clients ESG related investment mandates. In the first quarter, over $6.5 billion worth of green bonds were traded over the platform, resulting in over 32,000 trees being planted in critical regions across the world. Slide 8, provides information on our operational, resiliency and a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm proud to say that our teams across the globe were able to swiftly and safely transition to a work from home environment, all while providing an unknown interrupted level of service to our clients. Our client’s service and operational teams enabled over 10,000 individual trading system users during this time, allowing them to seamlessly connect to the MarketAxess trading system from home and remain engaged with the market. Given our ability to quickly mobilize and connect clients to our credit trading marketplace, we saw a record number of active firms and active user’s trade over the MarketAxess platform in March. This drove a significant rise in average daily inquiry volume, transactions and open trading settlements. The MarketAxess trading system remained resilient, while experiencing high trade volumes and a broad level of access. Our risk control – risk and control processes were effective throughout this period. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony who will walk through the financial results in more detail.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was a record $169 million, up 36% year-over-year. The 29% increase in credit trading volume and the inclusion of U.S. Treasury trading commissions resulted in a 38% uplifting in commissions. Information services revenue was up 17% in the first quarter and includes one-time data sales of approximately $800,000. Expenses were up 27% and operating income was up 44% year-over-year. We're particularly pleased with our operating margin of 54% in the first quarter. Strong trading results are providing the resources required to simultaneously expand margins, increase investments in new growth areas and increase dividends to our shareholders. The effective tax rate was 18.4% in the first quarter and reflects $6.3 million of excess tax benefits related to share based compensation awards. We continue to expect the full year effective tax rate will be within our previously stated guidance range of 20% to 22% although we do expect variability in our quarterly rate based on the timing of equity award exercises and vestings. Our diluted EPS was a record $1.96. The year-over-year increase in our diluted share count was largely due to the 146,000 shares issued as part of the LiquidityEdge acquisition. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 45% year-over-year driven by the increase in credit trading volume, higher U.S. high-grade fee capture and the inclusion of U.S. Treasury trading commissions. U.S. high-grade fee per million was $5 higher on a sequential basis, mainly due to slightly longer years to maturity on bonds traded over the platform. Our other credit categories fee per million increased $8 on a sequential basis, principally due to a shift in volume mix among products. Fee capture at the individual product level was very similar to the fourth quarter. As expected rates fee per million declined sequentially and was $3.87 and Q1 reflecting a full quarter of U.S. Treasuries trading activity. As a reminder, the rates category as a combination of treasuries and U.S. agencies and there could be some variability in rates fee capture due to product mix and due to volume tiering under our treasury's fee plans. U.S. high-grade distribution fees were $1.3 million higher than the fourth quarter level, primarily due to several dealer transitions to distribution fee plans during the quarter. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. On a year-over-year basis, expenses were up 27% for the quarter. Compensation and benefits accounted for over half of the year-over-year change and expenses as we continue to add personnel to support our growth initiatives. A year-over-year increase in head count of 60 and uplift in the variable bonus provision and higher stock based compensation expense for the main contributors to the rise in compensation of benefits. Clearing costs more than doubled year-over-year reflecting the 55% increase in open trading volume and inclusion of matched principal treasury trading volume. The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development and the trading platform along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. And the biggest factor influencing the increase in technology and communication costs was higher software licensing fees, some of which are tied to trading activity. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of March 31st were $499 million and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached a record $250 million. During the first quarter we paid out year-end employee bonuses and related taxes of roughly $40 million and the quarterly cash dividend of $23 million. We also repurchased 76,000 shares in total during the quarter, including 15,000 shares under our share buyback program and 61,000 shares associated with vesting of employee stock awards. We continue to have no bank debt outstanding and didn't borrow against our revolving credit facility. Based on those first quarter results, our board has approved a $0.60 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. This was the most challenging quarter in modern times for people and economies around the world. We certainly hope that medical advancements and good judgment will bring an end to this pandemic in the quarters ahead. We are proud of the role MarketAxess played in helping to keep credit markets functioning. We will continue to invest heavily to create lasting improvements in global fixed income markets. I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and unwavering client focus. We could not have achieved these results without their extraordinary efforts. We would now be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Rick and Chris and Tony. I guess I believe Chris said April-to-date was up 35% year-over-year. If that – and just making sure that's correct, but if it is, just wanting to get sort of the open trading percentage and I think he said that algo responses had gone back to pre-crisis levels. So does that speak to open trading as well?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Rich, I'll take the question. In – yes, you did hear my comments correctly for April volumes. We have seen liquidity stabilize across the market in April and we have seen consistent market share of our open trading platform. As you are well aware liquidity in March was much like toilet paper was hard to find but OT or open trading solution clearly was a critical part of the ecosystem throughout the March crisis. And so its market share did increase, but relative to the first quarter we continue to see open trading perform at quite high levels in terms of the overall volume on the platform, but even across individual assets like minis, like EM and other products; so continued to see robust performance in the open trading solution.
Rich Repetto: So I guess I interpret that as the open trading percentage of volume is similar to 1Q on the percentage basis? And I guess, and the last...
Rick McVey: I would just say it's actually similar to March levels. So we still have very high credit market spread volatility and that is creating an important layer of new liquidity through open trading and the open trading percentage of our volume is actually closer to March levels.
Rich Repetto: Wow. That's impressive. And then my follow-up would be, yet the Fed stepping in and just trying to get to see whether you can sort of parse out sort of the impacts, did that – how does the Fed stepping in? Improved liquidity and improved volumes during the month that carried over and I know there was a lot of new issuance at the end of the quarter. So that probably is trading in the secondary market more freely now, so just trying to parse out sort of the impacts of those two things on volumes?
Rick McVey: Yes, sure. Happy too. I think the Fed's initial focus was on short-term funding markets and the liquidity programs where we're generally focused on repo and other short-term funding markets to make sure that they were functioning properly. It's our understanding that they continue to make preparations to be able to participate actively in the primary and secondary corporate bond markets and the ETF markets for fixed income shares. We are not certain that any of that has started yet, but we believe that they're making their preparations to be able to do so. So right now, in terms of the bond activity, I don't think that is directly related to the Fed, but they obviously had a material impact and improving liquidity conditions in the short-term financing markets.
Rich Repetto: So do you think that with all the volumes in – at least on – while the volumes in appositive more driven by the incremental volumes by the issuance?
Rick McVey: I think that they're driven by ongoing credit spread volatility. Credit markets bottomed out around March 23rd and fortunately credit spreads have been narrowing and we've retraced about half the move over the four weeks since the lows. And it is – these are unbelievable new issue numbers and we were up around 250 billion in new issuance in March most of it in the last 10 days of the month and it looks like we're going to be even higher than that in April. And that those are remarkable new issue numbers as, as corporations are really tapping the high grade market in particular to create more liquidity on their balance sheet. But to put that in context, a good month for high grade new issuance is normally a bit over $100 billion, this will be the second month in a row that we've been up at around $250 billion. And for you and others that have been following us for a long time, you'll know that when new issuance is high you normally see some short-term dip in our share. That has not been the case in March and April. So I think it speaks very well to the long-term trend in market share on the MarketAxess system that share has remained high even though new issue levels are so robust.
Rich Repetto: Thank you, Rick, and hope you and your team and your families all stay safe and healthy.
Rick McVey: You too, Rich. Thanks.
Tony DeLise: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. I guess following up on that last portion, just trying to desegregate some of the long-term structural changes that continue to be at your benefit versus the near term benefits of spread widening. And so you gave some good stats around price improvement and activity. I guess, if you could just elaborate in terms of how you're thinking about either new customers that have been interacting with your venue or how we can think about kind of – at some level of normalization and one thing I think would be interesting is, the work from home environment, one of the dynamics around adoption of electronic trading has been behavioral from a user perspective. I'm wondering if you think this is sort of a kick start or a catalyst around some of that.
Rick McVey: Sure. Happy to take that one, thank you. But in March, was a really interesting month because we started the month with all of the major dealers and major investment managers trading off their main trading floors. And by the middle of the month everyone was trading from home. And I think it's personally remarkable that TRACE volumes grew the way that they did and MarketAxess volumes grew the way they did through that difficult transition. And I do think the work from home environment puts a premium on electronic trading. It's just easier to access the entire market from home using electronic venues. And I do think that that was one of the reasons for uplift in share and volume on our system. We expect that to last through most of the second quarter when we look at the plans to return back to main headquarters and trading floors. It's a very gradual process that most people expect to begin in June. So I think this quarter will be a full quarter of work from home. Third quarter will be a little bit of mix of both as people test getting back into their main offices. But what we saw in March and carrying into April is that our volume gains were a very healthy mix of more volume from existing clients and new clients using the system for the first time, and not only new firms but new individual trading users within existing firms. And the net result was in March, we had a new record in terms of the total number of active trading firms and a new record in terms of total active individual trading users. So we're really seeing this as an inflection point where more firms and more individuals are taking advantage of the efficiency of electronic trading as well as the transaction cost savings that are available.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Hey, thank you. Rick, so the Fed taps BlackRock to quarterback the credit purchases in the market. And obviously BlackRock is a very large user of the MarketAxess’ electronic platform. I'm just kind of wondering if you guys are seeing any disproportionate part of the Fed purchase flow through the electronic venue, either on, you know, a first order level, like BlackRock Fed purchasing cash bonds themselves to the electronic venue or maybe through a second order level, like the Fed purchases of credit ETFs or the underlying oddlot baskets might trade through electronic pipes?
Rick McVey: Sure. First of all, we don't comment on any individual client activity on the trading system. We –it's our belief that BlackRock is actively advising the Fed on all aspects of the program including primary and secondary corporate bond activity and ETF, fixed income, share purchases. But we don't believe that there's been any sign that they've been in the market yet. So what you're seeing right now is traditional customer and dealer business flowing through our platform at very high levels. And I remain optimistic that credit spread volatility is likely to remain high through the balance of this year. I made the comment in my prepared remarks; we would expect issuance levels to stay very high throughout the balance of this year given the challenges that are going on for many corporations that are likely to last for a few quarters. There's also more credit spread dispersion than we've seen a long time across different sectors and across different issuers and that leads to more trading activity. So our expectation is that, you're going to have higher levels of credit spread volatility than we expected throughout this year and combined with active new issuance and that combination is likely to keep market trading volumes elevated throughout the balance of the year.
Jeremy Campbell: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ari Ghosh: Hey, good morning everyone. So heading into the year, you have several growth initiatives from live markets, portfolio trading, expansion of your rates complex. There was a lot of these different initiatives in place. So could you give us an update on maybe how some of these initiatives look for this year, just given ones that might get pushed back because of the COVID crisis versus others that are perhaps easier to execute near-term despite the disruption? And then like the way some of these ins and outs might filter into the expense outlook for the year as well as it stands right now? Thank you.
Rick McVey: Great. And great question, a little open-ended, but I'll try and cover as much as I can. Obviously as you could see from our prepared remarks, our employees were phenomenal throughout the COVID crisis in their ability to migrate to home office, while maintaining high levels of performance and even in some situations improving their overall performance that we've seen. And so we are on track across all of our initiatives for 2020. There are a couple initiatives where we're relying on some third parties that are likely going to be slightly delayed. But in terms of rates I'm certainly excited about the rates performance on the D2D business in the first quarter, obviously record volumes there. With regard to our integration of the rates platform we continue to move forward unimpeded by the current crisis. Our hedging which went live in Q4 is continues to roll out. We have several dealers already live and a robust pipeline of dealer’s right behind them. Our integration of the liquidity – the formerly known LiquidityEdge platform into our institutional business is underway as well. Our first phase of that integration begins at the end of May where we will have institutional clients trading through the MarketAxess network, the MarketAxess broker-dealer into the Rates platform. So I'm happy to see that integration moving smoothly. Phase 2 of that integration is where our institutional clients can use full OMS integration into our rates platform and that's in second half of 2020 and on schedule. The last piece of rates integration is our net hedging solution, which is on-track as well for second half of 2020 certainly the earlier part of second half where we'll be able to provide a net hedging of client orders across the platform. So we're excited about those integrations. Other areas of initiatives obviously, we talked about the municipal bond initiative that saw a record volume in the first quarter as well. We rolled out our taxable muni solutions for EU and UK. MTFs. That’s an important introduction in the first quarter, which had immediate adoption by several of our major institutional clients that wanted access to those muni products and needing to use an MTF. Portfolio trading also saw phenomenal growth in the first quarter, over $1 billion in portfolio trades in the first quarter. 50% of those came in March, so we saw an active adoption in the crisis. We now have eight active clients and six active dealers, and we plan to roll out European products – credit products and additional functionality in Q2. And an important component of our portfolio trading solution is that we provide a multi-dealer in competition solution. So you can actually have a dealers bidding on your portfolio at the same time, which is important to improve the price efficiency. Obviously we continue to rollout product in our data business. The data business had great success in the first quarter as well. We've launched a treasury composite product and CP Plus, our pre-trade analytical tool continues to grow. So right now I think the only impact that we're seeing from the crisis and the pandemic is really a slight delay in our self clearing project, largely due to our reliance on third parties as we roll that project out. So while we're fully prepared internally we are slightly delaying until – the delay is really to the end of the second quarter potentially into the sorry, end of the second quarter, potentially into the beginning of the third quarter.
Ari Ghosh: Great, color. Thank you very much.
Rick McVey: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First is just on the U.S. Treasury market, there's a lot of press around liquidity in the U.S. cash treasury market in late March. The dealers kind of stepped back from providing liquidity, especially in off-the-runs. Just wondering, if your experience in the U.S. credit markets with open trading being a real solution to the market as dealers stepped away? Did that experience make you more confident? That's some form of all-to-all trading solution could eventually be successful in U.S. cash treasuries?
Rick McVey: It's a great question, because as we've all seen the U.S. Treasury market was hampered by a liquidity challenge across the market, obviously not just in off-the-runs, but even on-the-runs. And so it was an unusual liquidity event for the treasury market. We did however on our rates platforms see market share increase because we think the unique liquidity solutions that our platform provides. It's not a traditional club. It does allow for customized liquidity provision both for dealer and for clients. So we do think that, that model is the future of the liquid product market. It also was an anonymous all-to-all. And so to your point are anonymous all-to-all open trading solution that performed exceptionally well in the middle of the most challenging crisis – most challenging times of the crisis. We do expect that an all-to-all solution that does allow you to customize liquidity for rates would be a very viable solution as we go forward. So the performance of both our open trading for credit and the performance of our rates platform in the most severe moments of stress really provides us with a great confidence as we start to integrate those two markets.
Kyle Voigt: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Your line is open.
Chris Allen: Hey, good morning guys. I just wanted to ask a quick one on pricing, specifically investment grade. Maybe you could just walk through some of the dynamics, how that filtered through in the quarter in terms of duration, yield-to-maturity and yields and then just how the second quarter is kind of setting up and the outlook there? I'm just trying to think about how that would be changing moving forward?
Tony DeLise: Sure. Chris, this is Tony. On the investment grade side, you know there's lots of different factors that influence the investment-grade fee capture. You've got a year’s maturity where yields are trade size matters under our tiered fee plan. Dealer mix matters whether dealers are on distribution fee plans or all variable plans. At times, floating rate note activity also matters. But when you look at it – you look at it sequentially, the fee capture was up $5 from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, a years-to-maturity we're a little bit longer and less than a half of the year longer there was no impact from changes in the size buckets. There was a little bit of dealer mix change there. So it really was all about years-to-maturity. When you look year-over-year, much bigger change year-over-year first quarter of last year to first quarter of this year. But again, that was all duration related. It was longer years-to-maturity, on average lower yields. Going forward and on the April numbers, what I tell you on, on April right now is not just for investment grade, but looking across the Board. It's early in the quarter right now. There are lots of factors that I just mentioned that could influence fee capture, but if you're looking at April activities, there is not a lot to report on any variance of note at any product, not only investment grade but for high yield, emerging markets, Eurobonds, right now the fee capture all looks similar to the first quarter. Remember though, early in the quarter and that could change. But right now it looks similar to the first quarter.
Chris Allen: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Yes. Everyone, good morning, hope you're all well. Can you talk about the breadth and depth of loan-only asset managers providing liquidity or being price makers on the platform in March? And then also touch on what you've been seeing in April, any longer term changes you see from the current crisis to client workflows?
Rick McVey: Yes, happy to take that one, Chris. The number of client firms that are providing liquidity on the system continues to grow and we think that's the differentiator. When you have volatility like we had in the last five weeks of the quarter, the more trading connections you have, the better off you will be in terms of sourcing liquidity and reducing transaction costs. So we had a record during the quarter of over 900 firms that provided liquidity on the MarketAxess system. The vast majority of those over 700 were asset managers. So this is where we think we're making a big difference is that when markets get to these sorts of stress levels, our technology connects investors and dealers all around the world and the best price can come from anywhere. And you did see asset managers taking advantage of opportunities when there was heavy selling in the market, you saw dealers taking advantage of using the platform to take liquidity when they needed to reduce risk. So we think that this as an important quarter in terms of the advancement of all-to-all trading. And clearly the transaction cost savings that were approximately three times greater than the average quarter in 2019 validate the value of what we're doing and create behavioral changes, because the pricing during the stressful days oftentimes were just so significantly better than what clients were able to find through other means. So very broad-based in terms of liquidity providers, 1,500 active firms utilized Open Trading during the quarter. It's really becoming a very important global marketplace for credit.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein: Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to peel back the layers a little bit on the trading activity that you saw in the course of margin, maybe what you're seeing today in terms of the average trade size both on the IG side and the high yield side. I'm just curious to think about, whether penetrating some of the larger size trades was also part of the story here, given the liquidity in the rest of the market or the majority of the increase was really predicated on some of the smaller kind of typical sized trades for MarketAxess.
Tony DeLise: Yes. Alex, its Tony, I'll take the question. You're looking at the market share gains where we're obviously pretty healthy year-over-year and those market share gains were across all trade sizes and all maturity buckets. So, even in realizing, our block trading market share was around 10% and if you looked at it year-over-year, it was up more than 0.5. So regardless of trade size, regardless of the maturities market share did improve year-over-year.
Alex Blostein: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, I was wondering if you guys could give us a sense of how a potential, a large number of downgrades in the IG market could play a role into kind of opportunities for high yield opportunity on the MarketAxess side, meaning that, BBB is obviously a big part of the market, we're probably going to see a bunch of downgrades as those occur. Do they come through as a high yield trade at obviously a higher capture rate for MarketAxess or an IG trade?
Rick McVey: Yes. Good question, Alex, happy to take that one. Two things, when you have a period like we're seeing currently with more downgrades than we've seen in a long time and fallen angels, it does create trading opportunity. Those bonds oftentimes have to come out of investment grade portfolios and move into high yield or crossover portfolios or insurance portfolios that have the flexibility to operate in either place. So it's good for overall trading activity and yes, at the margin as large high grade issuers slide into high yield and begin to trade on price not spread that is also positive for our fee capture. And you can see from the first quarter volumes by product, high yield was the standout, volumes were up nearly 30% overall, but high yield more like 70%. So that's where the standout has been. We're taking share there and high yield volumes have been robust. This two is something I would expect to carry on throughout the year. We have not had an active period of default concerns in nearly 10 years; there really hasn't been a distressed market, large concerns about defaults until we got into this crisis earlier in the first quarter. So this is a very different credit market than what we expected when we started the year in January. And I do think for a host of reasons, that it will require more risk transfer, which leads to secondary trading. And I think we'll also continue to bring out the importance of all-to-all trading to source liquidity from any place in the world.
Alex Blostein: Great, thanks for the answers there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning guys. Maybe most of the questions have been answered, but maybe just to follow on the issuance question in the market share. Yes, obviously the market share tends to dip when new issuance is heavy. And appreciate your comments about the calendar likely remaining pretty intense. But is there any way to – in this environment assess what kind of headwind do you think that is on your market share? In other words, if that did normalize, how much your market share would increase, and the underlying question there is how much is the – is sort of the permanent changes that you think might occur in electronification of trading the underlying growth of that actually increasing and being masked by the new issuance, having new issuances?
Rick McVey: It varies and there are so many factors that come into play in terms of overall market volume as well as the electronic share volume that it does vary, but more often than not when you get a new issue as high as it's been the last couple of months, you also see the block trading percentage of TRACE grow and our share can be 1%, 2% lower during those months before those bonds are distributed and start trading with the rest of the secondary market over the following three or four weeks. So we do feel really good about March and April share expense, given that new issue activity is well above anyone's expectations for the pace that we would be on this year. It's clear that, there's a transition going on with institutional client behavior, 95% of our order flow is initiated by institutional customers. And when we look at our institutional share of TRACE for high grade, for institutional customer volume, it's now up around 24%. So we're getting close to a quarter of the activity with institutional clients taking place on the platform. We think that the combination of trading efficiency and transaction costs that we can reduce, and we also saw an incredible number of orders that were completed in March where Open Trading was the only price. So this is to us all going to create a more permanent behavioral change given the experience that clients have had in our platform, sourcing liquidity at the most difficult time. And we're pleased to see the underlying trends in share are taking place across all of our products, quite frankly.
Brian Bedell: That's a great perspective. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.
Ken Hill: Hey, good morning. Wanted to build on, so you guys had a lot of success with Open Trading during the quarter, we also had that exposed in new issuance activity, but I kind of thought something like live markets which was supposed to build on the Open Trading activity could help maybe kind of get you guys into a little bit more flow on the new issuance as it kind of gets into the secondary market there. I was hoping to comment, I know that's still early days, but maybe kind of the recent activity you’ve seen in the market has helped some clients along getting live markets kind of going on their platform or if you're seeing any increased interest because of that. Thanks.
Chris Concannon: No. Great question, I'll take that one. So live markets which we were piloting in the first quarter late fourth quarter, obviously we've been focused on on-boarding dealers to provide their streams. That process obviously is a bit of a setback given the current crisis, but what we have seen is a number of our clients, as Rick mentioned looking to provide liquidity, seeking methods and techniques for providing liquidity, live markets is an obvious solution for them to provide liquidity because they can join the bid side or the offer side of that market. So we are seeing higher levels of demand from our client base, looking to provide liquidity and achieve some of those huge cost savings that the OT market is providing. So again, slight setback given dealers have been distracted with the crisis in their own internal technology needs, but again the client side demand continues to grow as a result of the crisis and the current liquidity challenges.
Ken Hill: Got it. Thanks for the update there.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW, your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. There's a lot of press, especially in late March around HYG and some other bond ETFs that were trading at pretty significant discounts to their NAVs in today, what could have been made worse due to the lack of liquidity at that time. Just wondering if you think the regulators will be looking at the bond DTF market in the wake of this in terms of maybe putting certain liquidity requirements on underlying holdings or something of that nature or do you think that's going to be low on the priority list for regulators?
Chris Concannon: So happy to take that one, I guess I have a different perspective on the ETF performance during extremely volatile times, it's important to remember that the credit market is so fragmented and there are so many unique issues that oftentimes in my opinion what you were seeing was that the, the bond NAVs were behind not the ETF share price. So when you've got 7,000, 8,000 different bonds in an ETFs and anyone with a real time pricing mechanism is dealing with the level of volatility that we had during March, those prices are whipping around. There's an actual transaction taking place between two parties when the share is trade. And in my opinion, that's the best form of price discovery is an actual transaction. And when you look at the major ETF fixed income shares in March, it's a great story for risk transfer and market liquidity, share volumes were up over a 100% in the major fixed income shares and up over 70% for the full quarter. So I actually think that the ETF market held up incredibly well, it was part of the liquidity solution, not part of the liquidity problem. And I think, you're, you're seeing very clearly this new liquidity model evolve where ETF share trading is definitely part of the fabric for the institutional fixed income market now, almost all dealers and investors are using ETF shares as a way to transfer risk when they need it. They clearly did that in March. Portfolio trading held up well in March and that's another way to transfer risk and of course all-to-all trading is providing an essential layer of liquidity for all market participants as well. So I think it was a great indication that the reason the TRACE volumes were able to grow in March when they fell so sharply in 2008 is because all of those liquidity tools were at work during the crisis, ETF shares, portfolio trading and all-to-all trading through MarketAxess, Open Trading. That's why market volumes were able to go up and clients and dealers were able to transfer the risk that they needed to during those chaotic weeks.
Kyle Voigt: Thanks. And then maybe a second question for Tony. Obviously it's been a really strong volume environment to start the year and especially through April, over 35% year-over-year growth, if we see similar type volume growth for the remainder of the year and that 30% type range. Just wondering how you think about the expense guide and where that leaves you in terms of the current expense guide from when you started the year, because I think there's multiple things. Obviously the volumes are going to push up certain areas of expenses, but then the COVID-19 impact specifically; maybe that reduces TNE in some other areas of expenses. So just wondering how we should kind of put those pieces together, because any help there that'd be great. Thank you.
Tony DeLise: No. I am happy to answer that. The fact that we didn't say anything in the prepared remarks about the expense guidance, you can probably assume from that, we're still expecting the expenses to be within that original guidance range of $297 million to $314 million. But under this scenario, you suggest there or propose, if market volumes for the balance of the year were consistent with the first quarter, we could be near the high-end of that guidance range. And I would tell you that that would be good news. And we've got a number of variabilities in there, so people; we've got a fairly healthy hiring plan as we entered 2020. We can't – in some ways we can't control the level of attrition or the timing of hiring necessarily, but we're on budget with our hiring through April. 4We're effectively on-boarding new hires even in this environment. We expect to continue to hire, to support our growth initiatives, that's all good news. Other line items like variable compensation that are tied directly to results, you could imagine in the first quarter we had exceptional results off of the back of significant market volumes. If that continued that would be good news. If that expense line item is running higher than expectations. Same thing with clearing costs, we clearing costs doubled year-over-year and that's because open trading volume was up massively and we had a great quarter in treasuries as well. So those clearing costs are running higher than expectations that's all good news. So I would suggest that if we hit that high-end of the range, it also likely means that that topline performance, topline revenue growth is higher than expectations as well.
Kyle Voigt: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rick McVey for any closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you so much for joining us this morning and we wish you all the best getting through this crisis and be well and be safe. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 29, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and full year 2019; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will discuss progress in Open Trading and automation; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and the financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Our fourth quarter results contributed to our 11th straight year of record revenues and earnings. Revenue growth for the quarter was 15% in spite of the challenging year-over-year comparisons to fourth quarter 2018. You will recall that credit spreads widened significantly in Q4 last year, leading to a robust quarter for trading on MarketAxess. This year, credit spreads continued their march to the low end of the historical credit spread range and volatility declined. Operating income for the quarter was up 13% and EPS was up 9%. Our acquisition of LiquidityEdge closed on November 1 and added about $3.2 million in expenses this quarter, which Tony will cover in more detail. U.S. high-grade estimated market share reached 19.9%, international client volume was up 44% year-over-year and Open Trading volume was up 16%. Due to our strong results and growing free cash flow, our board of directors approved an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share. Slide 4 highlights our record full year results. Our long-term results reflect our consistent track record of growth with five-year compound revenue growth of 14% and compound EPS growth of 22%. For full year 2019, revenue growth was 17% and EPS growth was 18%. The results this year reflects strength in all four of our core credit products with record volume and revenue in U.S. high-grade, high-yield, global EM and Eurobonds. Total credit trading volume was up 22% this year and we had new records in all four core products for active institutional clients. Active international client firms reached 830 up from 293 in 2014. The number of client firms trading three or more products is just shy of 1,000 nearly double the total from five years ago. Our success in growing our global network of institutional customers has created a diverse space of trading revenue. Commission revenue in 2019 was up 19%. We believe our lead in global electronic trading revenue in credit products grew significantly during 2019. 96% of credit trading revenue at MarketAxess is generated by institutional client order flow. While we believe our key competitors are in the vast majority of their credit trading revenue in the dealer-to-dealer segment. According to FINRA TRACE volume data, client-to-dealer trading represents approximately 78% of combined high-grade and high-yield TRACE volume. Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. Our record results this year were achieved in a market environment that is not normally favorable for our business. Credit spreads declined throughout 2019 and ended the year near the low end of historical credit spread ranges. Credit spread volatility declined in the second half of the year. New issue activity levels were strong throughout the year. While monthly share numbers will always fluctuate, the six month estimated rolling average market share for combined high-grade and high-yield shows consistent growth and ended 2019 at the highest levels ever. Our investment in trading automation is adding important trading efficiency for both dealers and investors. Open Trading continues to provide an important addition to market liquidity and is reducing transaction costs. For the full year 2019, Open Trading price improvements delivered estimated transaction cost savings of $385 million to our clients. Slide 6 outlines the breadth and growth of our global network. Volume and revenue growth is being driven by a healthy combination of increased activity with existing clients and new investor client relationships. Total active institutional clients exceeded 1,700 this year, nearly double the active client base from five years ago. We are especially pleased with the progress we continue to make outside of North America. Active international client firms now totaled over 800 and international firms represent 30% of total trading volume up from 17% in 2015. European clients’ volumes were up 38% last year and global emerging markets volume was up 29%. We are excited about the long-term growth opportunity we see in CEEMEA, Asia and Latin America. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on Open Trading and automation.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick. Slide 7 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading adoption grew to 27.2% of global trading volumes, representing $136 billion in notional volume. The number of active Open Trading firms reached a new record of 1,436 firms up 10% year-over-year. The number of active client firms also drove significant growth across our four core products, notably in emerging markets with a 92% increase and Eurobonds with 109% increase year-over-year. We are also seeing an increase in interdealer activity as dealers continue to leverage Open Trading to move risk off their balance sheets. In the fourth quarter over $31 billion of dealer-to-dealer volume was executed on the platform, up 45% on the prior year. Interdealer volume now represents 6% of our total credit trading volume. Open Trading also continues to deliver a significant transaction cost savings for participants with an estimated $79 million in aggregate savings in the fourth quarter for both liquidity providers and liquidity takers. As announced last quarter, we launched the pilot phase of live markets, our live order book for active and newly issued corporate bonds. We are now actively onboarding clients and dealers to build a robust streaming liquidity solution. This innovation will allow participants to click-to-trade and leave live resting orders, which is a new way of trading credit. Our effort to move toward a self-clearing model is progressing well and we expect to be fully live in early – early in the second quarter. We expect self-clearing to favorably impact our clearing costs while improving our client experience. Slide 8 demonstrates the growing momentum of automation and credit trading. Automated trading volumes rose to over $24 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. 78 firms used our auto execution functionality in the fourth quarter up from 31 the prior year. Our new autoresponder functionality will allow investor clients to more efficiently engage in liquidity provision through the Open Trading marketplace. The use of dealer algorithms is also growing, with approximately 2.4 million algo responses in the fourth quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year. Dealer algos also drove an increase in the average number of price responses per inquiry to 7.3 in the quarter, up from 5.8 the year prior. This increase in pricing activity across liquid and illiquid corporate bonds ultimately can improve execution quality and the likelihood of execution. Slide 9 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. We’re pleased with the 14% increase in overall credit trading volume in the fourth quarter in light of less favorable market conditions for electronic trading. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 5% year-over-year to $253 billion for the quarter, solely due to an increase in estimated market share with flat trades volumes year-over-year. Other credit category trading volumes were up 26% year-over-year. Emerging markets and Eurobond volumes were both up more than 30% on a combination of higher estimated market share and an increase in estimated market volumes. Our rates category is mainly composed of trading volume in U.S. treasuries and reflects the post acquisition contribution from LiquidityEdge. On a pro forma basis, average daily volume for U.S. treasuries was up 62% from 2018 to 2019, resulting in over $14 million in total annual revenue. We believe these volume gains were primarily driven by an increase in market share. 2020 will be a build year for our rates business as we focus on integration efforts with LiquidityEdge, including the development of a dealer to client solution. As a sign of the early integration success, our auto hedging solution was launched in December 2019 and has already executed close to $400 million and treasury hedges. 2020, we’ll also see continued investment in our other new initiatives, including portfolio trading solutions, treasury net hedging, live markets, munis, automated trading enhancements and our recently announced Green Bond trading program. Our January month-to-date average daily credit volume is tracking more than 10% higher than January 2019, while U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes are somewhat flat. Our U.S. treasury volume is tracking more than 20% higher versus January 2019. And I’m happy to report that our January volumes include over $1.7 billion in Green Bonds, which will plant close to 9,000 trees under our new Green Bond initiative. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financials in more detail.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. On Slide 10, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall, revenue was $130 million, up 15% year-over-year. The 14% increase in credit trading volume and the inclusion of U.S. treasury trading commissions result in 15% uplift in commissions. Information Services revenue was up 21% in the fourth quarter and includes onetime data sales of approximately $700,000. Expenses were up 18% and operating income was up 13% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the LiquidityEdge acquisition, expenses were up 12% and operating margin was approximately 48.5% in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.9% in the fourth quarter and 20.4% for full year 2019. During the quarter, we recognized $3.6 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Our diluted EPS was $1.32. The increase in our diluted share count was largely due to the 146,000 shares issued as part of the LiquidityEdge acquisition. On Slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 19% year-over-year, driven by the increase in credit trading volume and the inclusion of U.S. treasury trading commissions. U.S. high-grade fee per million was little changed from the third quarter level. Years to Maturity bonds traded over the platform was similar to the third quarter. Our other credit category fee per million increased by – decreased by $5 on a sequential basis, principally due to the impact of two high-yield dealers migrating from the all variable plan to the distribution fee plan. Rates fee per million was $4.81 in the fourth quarter, which is slightly higher than the estimate we provided in our December volume release, and as a blended fee captured for U.S. treasuries and U.S. agencies. There could be some variability in rates fee capture as our U.S. treasuries fee plans are typically volume tiered. Please also note that the fourth quarter rates category fee per million only includes two months of U.S. treasuries trading activity. Reflecting a full quarter of activity and continued strong growth in treasury trading volume, we would expect the rates category fee capture to run around $4 per million respectively. Overall distribution fees were $1.9 million higher than the third quarter level, principally due to higher unused minimum fees on certain all variable plans and the two high-yield dealer migrations in the fourth quarter. We expect distribution fees in the first quarter of 2020 will be similar to the fourth quarter level. Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. On a year-over-year basis, expenses were up 18% for the quarter. Excluding approximately $3.2 million of LiquidityEdge related operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and deal costs, expenses were up 12% year-over-year and very similar to the third quarter level. Excluding the LiquidityEdge impact, compensation and benefits accounted for 65% of the year-over-year change in expenses, as we continue to add personnel to support our growth initiatives. Our year-over-year increase in headcount of 73, higher stock-based compensation expense and higher variable bonus provision, where the main contributors to the rise in compensation and benefits. On Slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of December 31 were $500 million and free cash flow reached a record $227 million in 2019. Dividends and share repurchases aggregated $93 million and capital expenditures were $35 million in 2019. Our recurring quarterly dividend is an important element of our capital management strategy. Our dividend rate has kept pace with our increase in earnings and free cash flow generation and with the announced 18% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share, we have nearly tripled the dividend level over the past five years. We expect to maintain our standing repurchase program with the intent of offsetting dilution from equity grants. During 2019, we repurchased a total of 60,000 shares under the plan. On Slide 14, we have our 2020 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures and the effective tax rate. We expect the total 2020 expenses will be in the range of $297 million to $314 million. This guidance range reflects a full year of LiquidityEdge expenses, including $2.8 million for amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, it’s important to note that variable clearing and technology costs are expected to represent roughly 50% of LiquidityEdge’s revenue. Excluding LiquidityEdge expenses, the midpoint in the guidance range would represent an approximate 11% year-over-year increase in expenses. 2020 capital expenditures are expected to range from $44 million to $49 million of which roughly half relates to capitalized software development costs, resulting from the investments we are making a new protocols and enhancements to the trading platform. The guidance also includes approximately $7 million of buildout costs for additional office space in London. We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2020 will range from 20% to 22%. The guidance range incorporates an estimate for excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Now let me turn the call back to Rick.
A - Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the consistent long-term growth we have delivered to our shareholders and even more excited about what we see for the next decade. The current product and client trends show an acceleration of momentum toward greater fully electronic trading in global credit products. In addition to our core product success, we are excited to have a serious entry point into the rate space with LiquidityEdge and we see additional product opportunities emerging in municipal bonds and elsewhere. We would now be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. I guess, my question is going to be on the expense guidance. And just curious, in terms of the spend levels, how they might be differing in terms of what you’re allocating to in 2020 versus last year. And also just clarifying, whether that includes the benefit from self-clearing.
Tony DeLise: Thanks, Dan. It’s Tony. So thinking about the expense guidance and we gave some color, probably, more color we’ve done in the past in terms of what’s driving the expenses. When you look at the individual line items as expected, the line item with the biggest growth year-over-year would be in comp and benefits. And we expect to add more personnel in 2020 to support our growth initiatives. It’s concentrated in technology and sales and business support. We also have the full year impact of the almost 75 people that we added in 2019. So that that comp and benefits line will be one of the drivers of the growth. The two other areas, though, and when I was looking at consensus estimates and looking at where our base budget varies, the two other areas are our big investment areas. It’s around depreciation and amortization and technology and communication. And on the depreciation and amortization side, we’ve had – we made a significant investment in the trading platform protocols, products and that shows up in capitalized software development. So Chris and Rick rattled off trading automation, building out the client to dealer treasuries, portfolio trading, hedging, live markets, all of that, results in an increase in capitalized software development, we end up amortizing that over three years. So you’re going to see an uplift there. And I think also the amortization of the LiquidityEdge deal in tangibles also contribute to that rise in depreciation and amortization. The other area where there was, again, a sizable variance between consensus estimates and where we’re looking at a base budget was in tech and communications. In there, that one had really two big components on a LiquidityEdge side, the technology costs today do vary directly with revenue. So as we’re expecting an uplift in treasury activity and revenue derived from treasuries, we’re also expecting an uplift in that technology line. And the second area to support all of the product development work, we are building out a cloud development and tools to support the growth. So that’s where you’re going to see some variances in the expense growth as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Actually, I just wanted to ask a follow-up on Dan’s question, because I think, he also asked about self-clearing, if there’s any benefit from self-clearing embedded in the 2020 guide, sorry if I missed that. And then also just the 11% organic growth rate for 2020, excluding LiquidityEdge. I just – over the past five or seven years, it just feels like the organic growth rate and expenses has kind of been in this 8% to 10% range on average. I’m just wondering, how should investors think about the medium-term expense growth rate – organic expense growth rate of the business, given the investments that you’re making. Is it in the double-digit range? Is it in the 10% to 12% range? Should we be thinking about that over the medium-term? And then just, if you guys kind of remind us your thoughts on operating margin expansion, operating leverage and how much you think you can kind of – you can generate an operating leverage on a normalized basis given the business. Thanks.
Rick McVey: I think you had more than one question there, Kyle. But on the – I will say, first on the organic growth rate. If you’re looking at, say, a three year, five year, 10 year basis on organic expenses, they have been double digits. They’ve been around 12% or 13%. So I don’t think anything where we’re guiding to for 2020. Again, absent LiquidityEdge overlay, anything we’re guiding to would be inconsistent with what we’ve done in the past. And this is all about investing in the opportunity to expand the geographic reach, the addressable market, new products and protocols. I think we’re doing exactly what investors want us to do. And I do think, again, if you look back historically, it wouldn’t be inconsistent with the way expenses have grown. The second part on clearing, yes, the – what we’re guiding to includes an expectation for the MarketAxess core or legacy business, when we transition over to self-clearing in the U.S. and we transitioned to a new clearing broker outside of the U.S. We are anticipating cost savings. That is built into the numbers. So fully embedded. Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect to go live sometime in Q2. So fully embedded in the guidance we’re providing.
Chris Concannon: The other piece you mentioned, which was question number two was around operating margins. And this – you’ve heard this from us in the past, where we are investing and we’ve had a period here over the last several years, where we’ve invested significantly in building out our geographic reach and launching new products and protocols. And again, you can reference back all of the initiatives we have underway right now. At the same time, we’ve been delivering operating margins around 50%. We don’t think that’s a bad answer, but this is all about growing and addressing the opportunity here. We think there is – if we’re right about investing today, we think there is an ability for margins to expand. If we’re right around our client to dealer treasury trading, if we have an uplift in muni trading, if market share accelerates in our core business. That’s all going to drive revenue growth forward. And I think there is an opportunity for margins to expand. But this is about investment. Look at this past year, we delivered. You can look at it and say that the expenses were up significantly in the past year, but our net income was up 18%. So we’re not managing to a margin number right now. I do think there’s opportunity to expand, but today it’s all about investment.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Rich Repetto: Yes, good morning, Rick and Chris and Tony. I guess, what caught my attention was Rick, when you highlighted 96% of your business is institutional and you think peers are D2D and you also highlighted that I think the FINRA TRACE is 78%. So I guess, the point here is, what are you trying to say versus your competition. And isn’t – I assume that D2D space is much lower capture, but isn’t a good liquidity as well? What are you trying to say about differentiating your platform with those numbers, I guess.
Rick McVey: I guess, what I’m trying to outline, Rich, is in the institutional client to dealer segment for fully electronic trading, we feel better about our market position than ever before. And it’s important to remember that there are no industry standards for electronic trading volume reports. And every company is different in what and how they report. So I think it’s important to look at what’s going on in the revenue side to compare with what is being reported on the volume side. And when we really talk to the major dealers in the space that see the order flow, we continue to feel like we have been strengthening our leadership position in the most important space for credit trading, which is the client to dealer institutional space. And when you look at the competitors that all of you follow, the retail space is primarily a dealer-to-dealer business. There’s also institutional dealer-to-dealer, both electronic and voice brokerage going on. And I believe that our lead has grown throughout the year in the institutional customer space. And yes, when you look at the facts within FINRA TRACE that helps to frame out the size of the market. And 78% of the combined high-grade and high-yield volume reported a TRACE involves a customer trade and 22% is a dealer-to-dealer trade. In addition to that, some of the stats that Chris outlined is that dealers are using our vast liquidity pool for credit trading for their own liquidity more than ever before. So we’re excited that we’re also starting to compete in the dealer-to-dealer space, but just to keep that in context, it represents 6% of our trading volume and 4% of our revenue. And I think, if all the competitors in the space would follow that lead in terms of the granularity around revenue reporting by client segment, it would add to your understanding of what’s really going on electronically by client segment as well as investors.
Chris Concannon: And Rich, I would just add – I just think the importance of the client business as we look at our network value and value that client business. It is a global business and it is a quite a sticky business versus the dealer-to-dealer business that we’ve seen on other platforms shift rapidly. So the build out in the investment and the cost, both in terms of time and human value to build that client network. That is an enormous advantage that we have and an advantage that we’re clearly using as we jump into other product areas like rates, munis and if you look at our success in emerging markets. So the client network is a network of great value and so we look at that – those volumes, as an important metric of our global growth.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Hey, thanks. As you guys highlighted earlier, non-U.S. clients and volumes have been very strong and emerging markets, in particular, is a pretty big market and has been a pretty big growth driver for you. I think kind of overarching, you guys have previously noted that every 1% market share pickup is like $30 million to $40 million of additional revenue. Just kind of wondering, with the recent switch to your new non-U.S. settlement agent, that has better kind of relationships and expertise in local markets. Maybe just discuss what your expectations are for potential accelerated market share gains in emerging markets in 2020 and maybe whether if that’s a function of new client sign-ons or deeper wallet share.
Rick McVey: No. Thanks for pointing that out. We’re – we couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity in Global EM and the progress that we are making. And in the prepared remarks, we did highlight that international growth over the last several years has been faster than North American growth. And it’s primarily because of our success in our EM franchise. Europe took the lead last year with a 38% increase in client volume within the region and EM was an important part of that. But we also saw a significant increase in active clients in Asia and improvement in our franchise in Latin America. And what we feel great about is that for many years, our EM volume gains were primarily driven by hard currency EM trading. We are now seeing an acceleration of interest in growth in local EM market trading, where we have 26 different local markets available for trading on the platform. So this is another sign that the demand for trading automation and electronic trading is growing well beyond the United States and it’s turning this into a very much global opportunity with really healthy trends in Latin America, CEEMEA and Asia.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point.
Chris Allen: Good morning, guys. Just following up on that point, you talked about investing in different regions. Is that where your – the investments could be driven from boots on the ground in AP and LatAm to keep the emerging market growth going?
Rick McVey: There’s certainly some of that. We’re increasing our headcount internationally to capitalize on the growing demand that we are seeing. But it’s also a technology investment. So it’s a combination of client facing people to work with the growing base of international clients that we serve as well as technology investment.
Chris Concannon: And I will just add, we’ve made a number of headcount investments, certainly, in Latin America as well as in Asia. We are seeing dividends paid as a result of those human investments we’ve made at people on the ground in both regions and growing our penetration in those regions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt.
Ken Hill: Hey, good morning. I had a question on the muni bond trading, you mentioned it in the prepared remarks. But I know that’s been an opportunity for sometime hoping that volume kind of moves a little bit more electronic. I was hoping you guys could provide a little bit more of an update on kind of behind the scenes effort, what you’re hearing from clients that might move that a little bit more electronic over time, because I know it’s a big opportunity. So not only maybe what you’re doing with clients, but how long you see that kind of playing out before we see some more substantial electronic volume.
Rick McVey: Sure. Great question. Obviously, we’ve got a great deal of focus on the muni bond area. Just here in January, we’re seeing our month-to-date volume increasing from both December and obviously, prior year, January 2019. We’re close to just over $800 million in volume in the month. So a pretty exciting area, we are seeing a shift from – among the retail dollars moving into SMA accounts, which are putting muni dollars in the hands of large institutions where we have a competitive advantage. So we've seen some uplift from adoption of our traditional, institutional clients as they shift how they handle their muni desks. And we're seeing rewards from both technology investments and also the OMS solutions that we provide those institutions. So we're excited about the muni space. We expect obviously to see continued penetration in our clients across the institutional region. We also are seeing benefits, many of the Green Bonds are found in the muni space. So we're deriving some Green Bond benefits as a result of the demand in Green Bonds that are coming in from both Europe, Asia and the U.S. and our Green Bond activity is growing as a result of our muni growth ironically.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse.
Ari Ghosh: Hey, good morning everyone. So just on – back to LiquidityEdge, Chris, maybe you could take this one. Could you update us on the timeline around the rollout of some of the new offerings and cross-sell opportunities that you see this year? And then if I think about the treasury space, maybe talk about a little bit about your competitive positioning as the industry adoption of some of these streaming protocols increase? Thanks.
Chris Concannon: Yes, great question. Obviously, we're very excited about the LiquidityEdge acquisition and just the dealer-to-dealer business and the progress that LiquidityEdge has made in the year. We've got over 125 banks and dealers on the platform, 21 of the 23 primary dealers and obviously their ADV was tracking in 2019 over 2018 probably about a 60% growth over 2018. As we think about the integration of LiquidityEdge on the MarketAxess platform, we start with the hedging solutions that we're able to – we launched in December of last year. We are also expecting net hedging solutions coming in the second quarter. So further enhancements and build out on our – hedging solutions for our corporate bond trading. More importantly, our dealer-to-client integration where we actually allow our institutional clients from the MarketAxess platform to access dealer streaming liquidity, we expect that to be launched in the second half of 2020. So we're excited about the build out there as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deustche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Bedell: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe Chris and Tony, if you could talk a little bit more about the spending on growth initiatives in a few areas. And how you – I guess, the scalability of how you're developing these and maybe kind of rank them a little bit, but it would be obviously Open Trading. But Auto-X obviously, again, you've gotten a very strong traction there. If you can talk about the spending in the 2020 plan for that and how that is already scaling. And then I think Chris, you mentioned the portfolio trading solutions also being a big growth area. Thanks.
Tony DeLise: Sure. Well, first on the scaling, I think it's most evident in our automated trading solutions. Our Auto-X feature, as I mentioned, saw a $24 billion in volume just in the fourth quarter alone. So we didn't add headcount to offer additional auto execution functionality. And yet we are seeing those levels of volume coming across the platform. We are also seeing better penetration within clients that have already adopted Auto-X. And what I mean by that is either rolling out to additional product or offering larger sizes in their Auto-X solution. So that's some of the growth is both new clients adopting auto execution solutions but also current clients increasing their use of auto execution. And then as I think about a portfolio trading probably has the most scale because it's built, we're adding features throughout the year 2020, but the largest part of the building has been done and now it's really client adoption. We have 93 clients now onboarded to execute portfolio trades. That's about 830 traders across our institutional client base and now 11 dealers supporting pricing in our portfolio trading solution. So we're excited about what the portfolio trading technology can do and how much of volume can come through those very large block trade portfolio trades.
Chris Concannon: And then just one add-on on the spend. If you looked at 2019 our spend for enhancements to the platform rolling out these new protocols, it was almost double the spend in 2018 so just put it in perspective, 2018 capitalized software development, roughly $11 million, 2019 roughly $22 million. When we look at 2020 and in the prepared remarks, you saw some – get some color or commentary there. We expect that capitalized software development to have another uplift in spend. So we had a big uplift in 2019 and we're expecting another year of heavy investment in 2020.
Rick McVey: And I will just say add, our Green Bond initiatives will scale quite nicely. We looked – we saw close to $20 billion in Green Bond activity in 2019 and as I mentioned, we already have $1.7 billion in Green Bond trading just in this month alone. So we're excited, we really didn't have much of an initiative in 2019 for Green Bond trading. And as we look at 2020, we're excited about planting five trees for every million dollars in Green Bond trading. We think that's an enormous incentive for our clients because they will get credit, ESG credit for trading on our platform. And as you know, ESG is quite a hot topic, not only in 2019 but clearly in 2020. So I would say, our Green Bond trading incentive is probably our most scalable offering on the platform right now. But I'm a little biased.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Blostein: Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. Bigger picture question for you guys. So, electronic trading of credit obviously continues to expand beyond the sort of traditional RFQ model. You guys have very strong presence in the all part of the market and obviously launching portfolio trading and other kinds of protocols. Can you help us think about the competitive landscape in that part of the market, outside of the RFQ model, which obviously where is MarketAxess more dominant, and importantly, how you think pricing dynamics will evolve for some of those newer protocols? Thanks.
Rick McVey: Sure. I'll take first crack at that. And Alex, good morning. First of all, on portfolio trading the demand is growing but it is in very early stages. And what we have seen and also heard consistently from the market is that portfolio trades still consistently tend to be bilateral trades, although there is some increase starting to occur in multi-dealer portfolio trades. But in our early portfolio trading on MarketAxess, we are providing value by primarily processing a trade that's taking place off the system. So dealers and clients are still negotiating the bonds in the portfolio and the pricing benchmarks that they will use off system with spreadsheets and then taking advantage of the processing benefits online. And it's our understanding that that's generally what's taking place elsewhere. I would expect that to continue to develop in terms of more automated portfolio trading solutions. But my view is that it's an early stages today. And also – the other thing that we do is track what we believe to be portfolio trades that hit the TRACE tape. And while the growth rate has been very high, the estimates that we have that we've confirmed with major participants in portfolio trading around 3% or 3.5% of high-grade TRACE volume. Taking place through portfolio trading and more like 2% to 2.5% in high-yield. So it's an important and growing segment but still a relatively small part of the secondary market. The other piece is that there is some demand emerging for sessions based trading and that really has led to our investment in live markets. We think that very active benchmark bonds as well as new issues can trade closer to a live market environment. And that is exactly why we've invested the time and effort into live markets. And we do see reason for optimism there with the client and dealer demand that we're starting to see for live markets. 
Chris Concannon: And I'll just add when you think about our auto execution functionality, we are taking the traditional RFQ market and creating a no-touch solution. While pricing doesn't change, they are continue to be automated RFQs over time how we execute an auto execution and the speed of the RFQ can be increased. So you get the similar benefits to a streaming price as you speed up RFQ into a continuous RFQ or a request for stream type of model. When I look at the rates business obviously that the most liquid asset class on the planet is our U.S. treasury market, it continues to be serviced by an RFQ model from the dealer-to-clients market – in the dealer-to-client market. So we are looking at not only that solution, but a request for stream solution as well to help solve the speed of execution in the treasury market. And then just as Rick mentioned, our live markets is still in pilot form. It's out there being offered. We have 37 participants live on the platform seven dealers currently on the platform. We're still waiting on dealers to connect and stream price. And that's a critical change in the credit market as dealers are build out their capabilities to stream a live pricing throughout the day. And I think that's an important development both in Europe and in the U.S. as all of our traditional dealers start to build out streams for pricing. And that's when the market solutions can change. And obviously, on live markets our trading desk is routinely – our trading desk is headed by Mike Sheehan, who is routinely contacting clients, letting them know about activity on the platform. So we have the eyes and the ears of active trading going on, on live markets.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Chris Shutler: Hi, guys. Good morning. Two questions, in high-grade, it looks like Open Trading as a share of your total volume has been pretty flat over the course of the year. Maybe just talk about what's caused that stabilization in that percentage. And then secondly in portfolio trading, I hear what you're saying that it's early days, but over time is that functionality does become more automated and matures. How should we think about the fee capture for our portfolio trade relative to your current averages?
Rick McVey: Sure, Chris, it’s Rick. I'll take the first crack at that one. But when you look at Open Trading percentages, 27% is still a significant addition in new market liquidity for credit market participants. But it will also vary in our opinion with overall market conditions. And we saw a huge increase in Open Trading percentage in the fourth quarter of last year, when we had a significant pickup in credit spread volatility and widening spreads. That was not the case this year where we had a decline in credit spreads throughout the year and a decline in volatility. So I think you'll see it vary with different market conditions. The other point to remember is that our trading automation tools have allowed dealers to be much more responsive on the system to client inquiries. So the dealer responses have gone way up over the last year and a half or two on the back of the work that we've done with many of them to promote their algos on MarketAxess. So I think it's a combination where a dealer pricing continues to get better on the platform. Open Trading is providing an important additional layer of liquidity but also market conditions which throughout the year saw declining spreads and declining bid offer.
Chris Concannon: And I’ll just add that portfolio trading, while it's something that we hear a lot about, it's still a relatively small part of the market. It's also a market that we don't touch today. These are large blocks that are going off in the large block market. It's something that we have been striving to get in the middle of – portfolio trading solution, it really requires a great deal of efficiency today, dealers and clients are passing back spreadsheets. And so our solution really is a workflow solution at first. Over time we think it can generate more secondary trading activity on the platform as a result of either dealers liquidating positions brought down from a portfolio trade. So the pricing of our portfolio trading and again its initial rollout pricing is lower than traditional RFQ but the size of the portfolios can get quite large. And it is a target market that we don't have on the platform today and one that we're chasing.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Rick McVey for his final remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded October 23, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2019 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will discuss new initiatives in automation; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2019 results. This morning we reported record financial results driven by broad-based volume and market share gains across products and regions. Total fully electronic trading volume reached a new record of $529 billion, up 37% year-over-year compared to Q3 2018. Open Trading volume was up 61% to $142 billion. Our growth in trading activity outside of the U.S. also accelerated with international volumes of $160 billion, up 59% year-over-year. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share also reached a new record of 20.2% in the quarter. Third quarter revenues were a record $132 million, up 30% from the prior year. Operating income for the quarter was up 42% to $66 million. Operating margins expanded to over 50% and diluted EPS was up 39% to $1.42. Last week we announced the addition of Justin Gmelich to our Board of Directors. Justin was most recently Chief Operating Officer for fixed income, currencies and commodities at Goldman Sachs, and prior to that he was the Global Head of Credit. We are thrilled to add his experience and strategic advice to our Board. Slide 4 highlights market conditions. Market conditions were mixed during the quarter. Credit spreads over treasuries remained relatively flat and credit spread volatility during the quarter was up modestly. Interest rates around the world continued to decline on the back of central bank monetary policy easing. New issue activity was robust with high-grade issuance up 14% versus the third quarter of last year. TRACE market volumes were healthy during the quarter with high-grade TRACE volume up 10% and high-yield TRACE volume up 19%. Fee capture improvement during the quarter was driven by longer average maturities and higher duration in high-grade and a favorable mix shift in the other product category. Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volume reached new records in the quarter of $142 billion, up 61% year-over-year. Open Trading now represents 27% of our total volume, up from 23% a year ago. Open Trading volumes grew strongly in all product areas, most notably in emerging markets, where Open Trading volumes were up 143% year-over-year. Over 348,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 283,000 in Q3 2018. Dealers are increasingly using Open Trading to both provide liquidity and to reduce risk as liquidity takers. As a result, our dealer to dealer average daily volume grew to $480 million, up 89% year-over-year. By seamlessly connecting global participants in an all-to-all marketplace, Open Trading is creating new trading opportunities and reducing transaction costs. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $61 million in transaction costs through Open Trading, up 72% from the third quarter last year. In addition, we estimate that liquidity providers saved an estimated $50 million in the quarter, up 49%. The combination of transaction cost savings and improved trading efficiency is the cornerstone of our value proposition for dealer and investor clients. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on new initiatives and trading automation.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick. Slide 6 outlines our new business initiatives. While our growth trajectory continues, we are focused on building sustainable long-term growth opportunities. I’d like to highlight several of those initiatives today. Last week we launched Live Markets with a pilot group of investor and dealer clients, and we are starting to see early interest in this new protocol. It’s clear that different trading styles are required for more liquid and newly issued corporate bonds. This coupled with the growing adoption of automated trading strategies underscores the need for a protocol that offers live order-driven liquidity for both investors and dealers. We are also actively building new portfolio trading capabilities, which is an enhancement to our existing list trading capabilities. Our portfolio trading solution which we expect to launch next month will support the growth in trading large fixed income portfolios, including unique customized portfolios, as well as the creation or redemption of fixed income ETFs. Our award-winning Composite pricing engine is also supporting the launch of our joint – jointly developed eNAV product, which is part of our partnership with Virtu. The combination of Virtu’s fair value calculation tool for ETFs with our proprietary fixed income market data has brought real-time price evaluation to the market for fixed income ETFs. This data product which has interest across the ETF trading community ultimately brings more participants into the fixed income ETF ecosystem. In August, we announced the planned acquisition of LiquidityEdge, a leading U.S. treasuries trading venue. This acquisition brings streaming treasury liquidity and trading capabilities to MarketAxess. While LiquidityEdge primarily serves the interdealer treasury market today, our dealers see a strategic opportunity to grow the business by building custom dealer to client connections, which we hope to launch in the first half of 2020. In addition to the ability to trade U.S. treasuries on MarketAxess, the acquisition also supports the further expansion of our treasury hedging capabilities, with the first phase of these enhancements set for launch later this quarter. We now have all the necessary regulatory approvals and expect to close the LiquidityEdge acquisition in the coming weeks. Slide 7 demonstrates the growing momentum of automation in our market. Institutional investors and dealers are increasingly demanding trading tools that allow them to work more efficiently while achieving transaction cost savings. Our automated trading tools backed by our AI powered pricing data is helping them to achieve both, low-touch trading combined with attractive cost savings. Investor adoption of our Auto-Ex functionality continues to grow rapidly with 63 firms now actively using our automated functionality this quarter, up from 28 the prior year. Over a 115,000 our Auto-Ex trades took place in the third quarter up 96% year-over-year, and over 22 billion in volume was conducted via our Auto-Ex up 156% year-over-year. The use of dealer algorithms is also experiencing growth with approximately 2.3 million algo responses in Q3, a 61% increase year-over-year. We’re continuing to invest in our automated trading functionalities by developing a new liquidity provisioning solution. Our new autoresponder tool will allow investors to automatically respond to request for liquidity via anonymous, Open Trading marketplace based on a set of predefined rules and criteria. Portfolio managers and their traders will be able to automatically monitor and react to unique pricing opportunities across their portfolios. Thus, enhancing transaction costs savings for all investors. We expect this new enhancement to launch next month. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financials in more detail.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. Please turn to Slide 8 for summary of our trading volume across product categories. Overall trading volume was up 37% as we experienced significant year-over-year growth and active clients, market share and market volumes across each of our core four trading products. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 27% year-over-year to $262 billion for the quarter on a combination of a 2.7 percentage point increase in estimated market share and higher U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes. Our other credit category trading volumes were up 53% year-over-year on a combination of higher estimated market volumes and gains in estimated market share. Our trading volume in emerging markets, U.S. high yield and European corporate bonds were each more than 50% higher than the prior year. Similar to the second quarter, the inquiry mix during the third quarter favored client buying. Our investment in municipal bond trading is also showing dividends. Trading volume grew to $2.3 billion in the third quarter, up 77% year-over-year based on participation from 225 investor clients and 70 dealer clients. Open Trading is also a meaningful liquidity source and driving transaction cost savings and represents almost half of our municipal bond volume. Realizing that it is early in Q4, and there are seven important trading days remaining in this month. October market volumes look similar to third quarter levels and October U.S. high-grade and high yield market share are currently running below third quarter 2019 levels. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was a record $132 million up 30% year-over-year. The 37% increase in trading volume resulted in a 32% uplifting commissions. Information services revenue was up 7% and on a constant currency basis up 11%. Post-trade services revenue was up 9% and on a constant currency basis up 17%. Expenses were up 19%, and operating income was up 42% year-over-year. Operating margin was up 4.3 percentage points and reached 50% in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 19.8% in the third quarter and 20.9% on a year-to-date basis. We expect our effective tax rate for full year 2019 will be near the lower end of our guidance range of 20.5%. Our diluted EPS was a record $1.42, the increase in our average share price during the quarter accounted for the rise and the diluted share count. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 46% year-over year, driven by the 37% increase in trading volume and an increase in the overall fee capture rate. Our U.S. high-grade fee capture can vary quarter-to-quarter due to variety of factors including duration and trade size. U.S. high-grade fee per million was up $11 from the second quarter level, due to the favorable impact on duration from lower yields and longer years to maturity. Our other credit category fee per million increased by $6 on a sequential basis, resulting from a heavier weighting in trading volume attributable to high yield and emerging market bonds. Fee capture at the individual product level was unchanged sequentially. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. On a year-over-year basis, expenses were up 19% for the quarter, and up 16% year-to-date. Compensation and benefits accounted for more than 60% of the absolute change and expenses for both the quarter and year-to-date, as we continue to add personnel to support our growth initiatives. Our year-over-year increase in headcount of 67, higher stock-based compensation expense and higher variable bonus provision were the main contributors to the rise in compensation and benefits. We expect that full year 2019 expenses. We’ll end up near the high end of the expense guidance range of $256 million. The expense guidance includes roughly $1.5 million for acquisition related transaction costs but excludes the post acquisition impact of the liquidity as transaction. We recently kicked off the 2020 budget process, so it’s a little early to talk about an expense guidance range for next year. That said, I’d like to point out two items. First, the step function increase in expense associated with the senior hires added in 2019 is not expected to repeat in 2020. And second, we will need to overlay the LiquidityEdge, operating expenses and deal-related intangible asset amortization expense into the 2020 guidance. LiquidityEdge’s operating expenses in the third quarter were approximately $4 million with roughly 50% of those expenses tied directly to trading volume and revenue. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30th were $556 million, and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached the record $216 million. During the quarter, we paid the quarterly cash dividend of $19 million and also repurchased 7,500 shares under our share buyback program. Just a quick reminder, that the LiquidityEdge purchase price is $150 million, including $100 million in cash and $50 million in stock. We are funding the cash portion more readily available cash position. Based on the third quarter results, our Board has approved at $0.51 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. The results from the third quarter demonstrate great progress in moving the credit markets forward through increased trading automation and global trading connectivity. Open Trading is creating new trading opportunities for all market participants and driving down transaction costs. In addition to growing momentum in our core products, we are excited about the potential and the expanded slate of new opportunities. U.S. treasuries, municipal bonds, portfolio trading, and Live Markets all demonstrate our investment in new and large areas for future growth. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I guess, if you could talk about the new initiatives you have several in place that are either started or slated to come online. Can you talk about in terms of contribution for, kind of, 2020, what you think could have the biggest impact, incrementally?
Chris Concannon: Well, we mentioned a number of new initiatives, some obviously feeding our core business, like portfolio trading; some feeding our market data business, like eNAV and data products. I would say, LiquidityEdge is probably the most exciting opportunity given it’s the largest market in the fixed income arena and one we really don’t offer today. So having the LiquidityEdge acquisition close these coming weeks and then making available our clients a dealer solution sometime in the first half of next year is an exciting addition to our current offering of corporate bonds across our largest clients. So I’d say that the LiquidityEdge acquisition and the opportunity to grow a sizeable rates footprint is what we’re most excited about. But that said, we’ve got a lot of new initiatives. If you look at our municipal opportunities that Rick mentioned, that’s a wonderful opportunity. We had record volume in August of $1.2 billion, and obviously, a broad set of clients joining our opportunity in munis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Repetto of Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Richard Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Rick and Chris and Tony. I have one question, but it might have two parts.
Chris Concannon: Shocker, Rich.
Richard Repetto: Shocker. But it is about our favorite topic, automation. And I guess, one thing I just noticed the algo responses wrote Open Trading, and I guess the other, I guess, was in the automating when you just talked about all automation. The algo responses were down quarter-over-quarter, but the number of trades were up. And I’m just trying to see is this a more efficient, people getting better, what you call, responses to their – the fewer responses but more trades? And then the bigger part that goes along with this, is this portfolio trading? There’s a lot of people that think that’s that the next big initiative and not to downplay LiquidityEdge, but as far as moving the corporate bond market more electronic, I guess, would you share that view that this portfolio trading could be the thing that really pushes the automation forward? And that’s it.
Chris Concannon: Okay. So on the – above the algo execution trade volume, I think, really what we are seeing, Rich, is the adoption of our auto – current Auto-Ex solution is largely in the smaller trade size. So many of the large firms that have adopted Auto-Ex tend to target smaller ticket sizes to allow them to just automate that feature. It allows their traders on their desk to focus on larger, more complicated trades. So it’s proven to be quite efficient tool for most of the trading desks that are deploying it. With the algo responses, you’re seeing – they’re responding to an Auto-Ex smaller trade size. So you tend to see growth in the transaction volume and with less growth in the algos, if that makes sense. But we are seeing – if you think about our launch of Live Markets, that’s a market that calls for live algo streams. So it’s a – we’ll be seeing much more activity in our algo streams as a result of Live Markets as streams start to join the market. So when you think about the automation of the overall market, we’re offering multiple features, and we’re just starting really that roll up. The autoresponder that we talked about today is a key function to bring more of the investor interest into an automated feature. If you think about it today, we offer – Auto-Ex is allowing them to auto RFQ, requesting liquidity and you typically get algo responses to those Auto-Ex requests. Autoresponder allows them to actually respond to other RFQs that are in the market, using Open Trading the anonymous feature. So we expect to see higher growth rates of transaction volume as well as volume feeding through our entire auto functionality.
Rick McVey: Rich, I’ll just jump in on the second one, but I agree with your thesis that portfolio trading has been growing and likely to continue to do so. And I really think it’s an important part of the new market-making model that’s showing early signs of increasing overall market turnover in credit trading. And it’s sort of a four-part answer, but investors in certain situations are finding a more efficient means of transferring risk through portfolio trades with the dealer community. It is still a relatively small part of TRACE. We estimate 2% to 4% of TRACE volume but growing rapidly, and we want to be sure to have the solution in place for our clients, which we will roll out this quarter. It’s also important to remember that these portfolio trades create a lot of secondary activity around the tail risk that investors or dealers are trying to manage, and a lot of that we see. So the growth in portfolio trading is already been part of the growth that you’re seeing in our volumes. But I think the other pieces that are improving turnover are the increase in all-to-all trading primarily through our Open Trading solution, which is bringing new participants into the market. And then also the adoption of the ETF share trading in a much bigger way by both dealers and investors is another way to move risk. So you really see this whole new risk-transfer model emerging that we are excited about because we think it will not only be healthy for our volumes but it also comes with the prospect of increasing market turnover.
Chris Concannon: And Rich, I would just add on our portfolio trading solution that we’re launching next month. We’ll be able to offer clients the ability to trade up to 1,500 bonds, which is unique. We also will allow them to market that to – up to five dealers. So it allows investors that are currently conducting portfolio trades in a less-than-efficient environment, some even e-mailing spreadsheets to conduct it in a much more efficient way and improve the pricing. We’ll also be putting in front of our clients, our CP+ calculation. So they will be able to price their portfolio and really regulate the transaction costs of their portfolio trades going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Thanks. So I remember weak volatility used to be a little bit of a headwind for you guys, but it’s clearly picked up over the past year. So one question we keep hearing from clients is about the impact in the next year volatility settled down a little bit. Now I know this would really ignore like your new product capabilities and launches, like portfolio trading, net spotting, et cetera, but at a conceptual level is there a way to kind of untangle the year-over-year growth in volumes and market shares between some of the market-based tailwinds like widening spreads and revolve versus your organic initiatives, like the rise of algos and the increased use of Open Trading over the past year?
Rick McVey: Yes. I’ll take the first bracket at that one, but this year, we – if you look back at the fourth quarter of last year, we had significant widening of spreads and higher volatility and we did exceptionally well on market share gains during that quarter. If you look at the totality so far in 2019, the trend has been for credit spreads to narrow. That is usually not the ideal market environment for our share gains, but we’ve managed to gain a significant amount of share across products in spite of that market environment. And I do think you’re right to point out that one of the risk is low volatility going into 2020, very difficult to predict and there are plenty of geopolitical and sector risks emerging that could change the volatility outlook in a hurry. But very low levels of interest rates and credit spreads for a prolonged period would be a risk to overall market volumes and market share. But we’ve been through so many different market environments over the years, and I think the consistent theme has been year-on-year market share gains that drive our revenue and earnings growth. So we’re confident that we will continue to gain share in any market environment going into the new year.
Chris Concannon: And Rick, I would just add that we are adding to our portfolio the U.S. treasury market, which is certainly one of the largest fixed income markets on the planet and one that we don’t offer our clients today. So in terms of organic growth opportunities if you hold market volumes constant, we’re tapping into quite a large market with really a large competitor in Bloomberg and their dealer-to-client solution in the rates market followed by another competitor in the client-to-dealer – the dealer-to-client market. So we have a huge market opportunity ahead of us with or without tailwinds.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Maybe just one on Live Markets, and I know it’s just launched a week ago, but can you talk about some maybe early client feedback? And maybe more importantly, are you seeing already kind of attractive quotes for those bonds being posted in that live order book? And then kind of a second part to that is just wondering if you can talk about just in more details about where you landed on pricing for that offering? And what incentives there maybe for underwriters on new issues, for example?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Thanks for the question, Kyle. Pretty excited about the launch of Live Markets. There are a lot of people here at MarketAxess working long hours to make that product come to fruition just last week. A reminder, it’s still in its pilot form, but we are excited about the activity that we’re seeing. We’re seeing daily trading activity on the platform, some great key factors. We’re seeing two-sided pricing coming into the platform. We’re also – we’ve seen new issue trades. Those are trades that we typically wouldn’t see in a new issue. We’re also seeing clients using the hidden order or reserve functionality that we offer, which is a key feature for clients to site inside the market and rest without disclosing any size or price information. So very early days, but quite excited about the client feedback. And again, a reminder, it’s still in its pilot form for the near-term. And Tony, do you want to cover the pricing?
Tony DeLise: Yes, I’ll pick up on the pricing. So Kyle, you’ll recall that, just generally speaking, when we set up these schedules, we’re looking at bid-offer spread in most cases. And we expect the trading in Live Markets, it’ll be the more liquid end of trading. It’s larger trade sizes, typically with tighter bid-ask spread. Also remember, this is a – it’s a liquidity take-or-pay or a markup model. This is – that’s the model we think scales best. But the little difference here, the little twist, we are incorporating some incentives or rebates for liquidity providers. So it does look different than the other fee models we have in place. The capture rates is going to be lower than what you see. The headline, U.S. high-grade fee per million and the capture rate, is going to be lower. It’s tough to pinpoint, as Chris said, it’s early days. We’re less than a week into the launch here. But just remember, it’s all additive revenue. I’m sure as the quarters go one, we’ll have more to share on where the fee capture is landing. But again, right now, it’ll be lower than that headline, U.S. high-grade capture rate.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Your line is open.
Chris Allen: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask another query. You noticed – you noted strong market volumes and strong share gains. Can you just give us some color where the share gains are coming from? Is it further electronification into specific markets, taking basically share from the incoming dealers, while you are taking share from other electronic competitors in each of the buckets? Any color there would be helpful.
Rick McVey: Yes. I think if you look at high yield and EM in euros, there’s a slightly different story in each one, but with high yield and EM, we think it’s further adoption of electronic trading by investors and dealers, moving more business away from phone-based trading to electronic trading, which is great to see because those markets are still in early stages of electronification and they are kind of in low teens areas and plenty of growth runway still in front of us. With euros, we’re confident we’re taking share from some of the other platforms in the region. There is certainly part of the story is further adoption of electronic trading, but I think, the combination of our Open Trading liquidity and the trading automation tools has really increased our market position in the European region. And remember, European clients are active with us in multiple products. So euros are only a piece of the story. We’ve done exceptionally well in EM with European clients, and we do see cross-regional activity in the U.S. credit as well. So really encouraged about the international story that’s developing.
Chris Concannon: And Chris, I’ll just add that the concept of moving liquidity away from dealers just doesn’t happen on our platform. Really, what we’re doing is, as Rick pointed out, converting more current volume between dealers and clients from the phone onto the platform where it’s more efficient and more electronic for both parties. We’re seeing dealers benefit from offering algo solutions and reducing their own costs while investors are feeling the expense pressures that they feel are able to reduce their cost as well. So we’re seeing it as a net benefit for both dealer and client. And more importantly, our OT solution is being adopted by both dealer and client. It has been a valuable source for dealers to a more liquidity in an anonymous way. So we’re seeing benefits that are being delivered to both dealer and client through the adoption of the platform.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hugh Miller of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Hugh Miller: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Hugh.
Hugh Miller: So wanted to start off, I guess, with some more color on Live Markets, and I appreciate what you guys did provide. Is the lower fee capture that you had mentioned kind of a function more of kind of the types of securities that would more likely to trade on Live Markets? Or is that more a function of just some of the early rebates that you are providing? And any color you could provide on just maybe the time horizon which that goes beyond pilot into kind of a more of a broader-based dissemination?
Tony DeLise: Yes. So Hugh, it’s more of a function of the type of bonds. Again, think about how we set up our fee schedules. The bonds typically that tighter bid-ask spread, we charge less. And the community that we’re going after here, it’s new issue activity, it’s the first several weeks after new issues come out. They typically have a tight bid-ask spread. It’s the most active bonds, whether it’s story bonds or benchmark bonds. Again, those typically are in larger trade sizes and trading a tighter bid-ask. So it’s more reflective of that. We do have some incentives in place and rebates in place, and that we’re starting off to promote liquidity on the platform. We think it’s the right thing to get Live Markets up and running. And let’s see how we run here for a couple of quarters, but again, the expectation is based on the type of bonds that we see going to Live Markets. It will come at a lower capture rate.
Rick McVey: And just to add to that, Hugh, that remember this is a part of the market where historically our market share has been very low. So it’s not a case where we’re cannibalizing existing trading activity and market share for transitioning the Live Markets. These are newly issued bonds and benchmark bonds that trade in tight bid-offer and often trade in blocked trade sizes. So even though the fee capture is likely to be lower than what we observe in the rest of our RFQ protocol, it is added to revenue and it’s designed to attack a part of the market where historically our share has been low, and we will commit to do what we always do. If Live Markets becomes a meaningful part of our volume, we will be transparent about the fee capture and the volume in that area, just like we are elsewhere.
Hugh Miller: That’s very helpful. Thank you so much. And then just on the follow-up for – just some housekeeping items here. Any distribution fees changes that we should be thinking about as we roll into 4Q or early 2020? And then of the $1.5 million in deal costs that you mentioned about LiquidityEdge, can you just let us know how much of that was 3Q versus 4Q?
Tony DeLise: Sure. Happy to take both of those. So on the distribution fees – and we’re always little bit cautious about giving guidance on distribution fees because we give dealers the choice of plans, and in most products we have couple of different choices and some of them have distribution fees, some of them are all variable. If it’s all variable there are minimum fee commitments. So it’s a little bit difficult to predict. Looking out right now, we are not tracking anything of real substance in terms of movement looking up, but I caution on one thing, the bid swing is around unused minimum fees on plans where dealers have minimum monthly fee commitments. We report those unused minimum fees within distribution fees. It does vary period-to-period depending on activity. So I do caution again, we are not tracking anything of significance, going into Q4, but I do caution those unused minimum fees can move period-to-period. Second part of the question on LiquidityEdge. I mentioned that the transaction cost for the full year are expected to be around $1.5 million, and that’s included in our expense guidance range. So we’re pointing you to the high end of the 2019 expense guidance range of $256 million inclusive of that $1.5 million. The majority of it came through in the first quarter. There’s some residual as we get closer to the closing date. There’s some valuation work that we’re completing, but the large majority of that came through in the third quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Shutler of – with William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys, good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Shutler: Can you provide some more detail on the autoresponder tool? Maybe give an example or two of how a client might use that functionality and the parameters they might set? And how many investor trading desks do you think are actually capable today of adopting that kind of a solution?
Chris Concannon: That’s a great question, Chris. Really, the way a client would use the autoresponder, it’s typically going to be a client that’s already using our Auto-Ex functionality because they’ll understand the parameter settings and have more comfort with the autoresponder as well. It will be likely sold in combination with both. But a client will load a list of bonds that they have some price levels that they are interested in and they can actually allow the autoresponder to monitor for other RFQs that are going on in the market without having a watchlist today and manually responding, which they can do today. Most of the clients feedback on autoresponder already was, I’d like to watch this list of bonds, but I just don’t have time to then engage in an RFQ process. So this allows them to have certain pricing limits. Certainly, we will be using our CP+ data feed as a guide as well, but it allows them to have certain pricing limits or other criteria around liquidity in the bond, how they RFQ is being formed, and so they can simply respond to RFQs in a fully automated manner and hear back. They can either have an accept button, where they actually make sure that they are priced right for that RFQ. But literally this is a way for them to fully automate a function that they do today, which is manually respond to other RFQs in the market.
Operator: And our next question comes from Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. Curious about how are you guys think about your ownership structure in terms of attracting the buy side and the sell side to participate in your platform? Does being independent really convey any event that you guys you see?
Rick McVey: Well, I would point out a couple of things, Patrick. We have been independent now. We’re about to celebrate our 15th anniversary as a public company. And it does, in our opinion, a number of positive things for our clients. One, we’re able to take into consideration the priorities for both investor and dealer clients, so we can be very balanced about our decision-making and our strategy with both investors and dealers in mind. I would also point out that our Board of Directors is a tremendous asset for the company, and adding people like Nancy Altobello and Richie Prager and now Justin Gmelich to our Board just this year brings us a really important outside strategic advice to the firm. So we’re really pleased with the way the Board interacts with the management team and collaborates on company strategy. On the dealer side, obviously, some of our competitors who have dealer ownership, one of them is going through a transition right now. We would expect that decline in dealer ownership to continue. And ultimately, it’s likely now based on what we’re reading that LSE will be the majority shareholder longer term. What we think that does is just kind of level the playing field on the dealer side where dealers are agnostic in terms of which platform is delivering the most value, the high-quality client order flow and the right pricing. So we think that, that helps to level the playing field a bit as well.
Chris Concannon: And I would just add when we look at our investor shareholders, I am very encouraged by that list of investors because most of them, if not every one of them, are informed users of the platform. So you have a unique circumstance where our largest clients are also our largest investors. They have very informed investment theses around the market that we run because they are actively using the market. And that’s hard to do if you are a – if you’re owned by a vertically integrated exchange, for example.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Hey, guys. Just had a follow-up to Chris’ earlier question on auto trading. When firms – new firms adopt auto execution, do they tend to increase the usage over time? Or is the big hurdle just kind of getting it turned on and then you see a lot of volume come through the pipes? I ask because I’m wondering if we’re going to see a similar adoption volume cadence with autoresponder or since clients are more used to automated trading could be more robust and lead to a stronger read-through to trading velocity and volumes?
Chris Concannon: It’s a great question. The sale process for Auto-Ex today is long. Typically, clients would adopt a small set of the Auto-Ex feature, try it out on certain bonds, get comfortable with the pricing and the execution quality, look at the transaction cost savings, do a lot of analytics around it before really rolling out to further bonds or bonds of different types of liquidity. Most importantly, we do see some clients increasing the size of their Auto-Ex. So they would typically launch an Auto-Ex feature on $1 million or smaller tickets and then over time increase those ticket sizes upwards of $2 million to $3 million, and we’re seeing some clients adopting a $4 million and larger size limit on their Auto-Ex features. We’d expect to see the similar rollout on autoresponder. Obviously, there’s some benefits of having a client already adopted Auto-Ex feature, but we do see a long sales cycle around the autoresponder.
Operator: And our next follow-up comes from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Your line is open.
Chris Allen: Yes. missed it. So I was just wondering if you guys provide the revenues for LiquidityEdge during the past quarter? Just trying to think about how they are billed moving forward?
Tony DeLise: Yes. So Chris, we didn’t give you the revenue specifically, but we did provide the volume numbers. So if you look on that – on the one slide that Chris covered, you’ll see average daily volume in the third quarter. It’s roughly $18 billion a day. And we did also provide some color two months ago when we had that – the call announcing the acquisition. And when you look at their fee capture, fee per million, the last 18 months it’s been bubbling around $3.50 per million. So you can do the math, and you can see that revenue is around that $4 million, $4.5 million in the third quarter. So that you can put the pieces together and see what it looks like for revenue. Also, we gave you volume growth there as well. There is some public information on the results for prior years as well. It was $9 million of revenue in 2018.
Operator: And our next follow-up is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Hey, guys. Real quick one. On LiquidityEdge, just wanted to confirm, once you do own it, how you’re going to change the disclosures?
Rick McVey: Yes. So Chris, what we’re going to do, and again keeping with that theme of being fully transparent and timely with delivering information, we’re going to stick with the monthly volume reporting. We’re going to report volume in three buckets, which will be U.S. high-grade other credits, those are the existing categories that we have today, and the third category will be rates. And when you look at rates, it will largely be the U.S. treasury reporting. We do have some agency and government bond reporting in there, but you’ll see that 99% of it is going to be U.S. treasury reporting.
Operator: And our next follow-up comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Richard Repetto: One more question on automated trading? I guess, on the – excuse me, portfolio trading. What is it going to be priced at? And do you think it’s going to be a substitute for the all-to-all trading?
Chris Concannon: It’s a great question, Rich. I was hoping you were going to ask about our muni record in August, but I’m happy to answer our portfolio trading.
Richard Repetto: I only have one question. I can’t ask that.
Chris Concannon: The way we’re pricing it is it’s going to be obviously cheaper than doing a per-ticket item. The functionality is designed to make it attractive for both dealer and clients who transact a large portfolio. But we do think it will create, as Rick mentioned, we’ll get the benefit of the tails of the post-portfolio trade that people unwind certain bonds within the portfolio. So it will be priced aggressively, certainly, at lunch because we see the market today, and we do think it’s – relative to the TRACE volume it’s small, but it is a large market that we are missing today. So initially it will be priced aggressively, and it’s really both for dealer and client. I think the biggest benefit is having the portfolio priced in comp with a variety of dealers being able to offer pricing on the portfolio. So the clients will see a benefit to their current trading environment where it’s not very efficient and their pricing is typically one-to-one pricing.
Richard Repetto: Okay. I’m happy to hear anything about…
Chris Concannon: If that was a question on munis, we did hit a record in August of $1.2 billion. So thank you, Rich, for that muni question.
Operator: I apologize. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt. Your line is open, with KBW.
Kyle Voigt: Thanks for taking the follow-up. So you saw some good growth in market data in the quarter. Just wondering if the uptick there was related at all to the Refinitiv partnership? And then just maybe just providing an update on kind of if you’re seeing uptake through that partnership. I think you said in the past that the sales cycles maybe a little bit longer there, but yes, wondered if it’s related to Refinitiv at all. Thanks.
Chris Concannon: No. Really, the uptick in market data, we really think – while we’re seeing a lot of activity related to the Refinitiv relationship, the impact is really not making its way to financials in the third quarter right now. We’re seeing, obviously, sales in Europe. Our Trax data continue to be a benefit in our market data of business currently, but we’re excited about some of the new products that we’ll have to offer. Obviously, having a treasury data feed is interesting to us. It will be a new product. And as we grow out our munis, we see an opportunity for municipal data as well. I don’t know if you heard on the call, but we hit a record in August. It’s $1.2 billion.
Tony DeLise: Kyle, just to add, that growth from, back in the second quarter to the third quarter, just to get a little more granular, combination of just the carryover impact of new data contracts during the year. So this year, we closed on data contract value of about $3.5 million. That’s 10% higher than all of last year. So through the nine months, we’re obviously in a run rate much higher than last year. We also had just – much lower impact that there was some onetime historical data sales during the quarter, but most of that is just the carryover impact from the increase in new contract activity.
Kyle Voigt: Got you. And Antonio, just because we’re in a follow-up territory here, can I just ask one more on expenses. We’re looking at the expense run rate for 2019 and trying to model out next year, you noted that a couple items aren’t going to reoccur next year, including the sign on of executive management members as well as some of the one-offs related to the acquisition, you called out the $1.5 million there. Can you kind of quantify all of those? So it’s $1.5 million for the – for maybe additional pro fees that are coming through in the second half? And then can you kind of quantify how much expense was in the 2019 expense run rate for the executive management hires that we shouldn’t expect to recur. And then just on organic growth basis should we be thinking more in kind of that high-single-digit type subterritory for organic growth into next year?
Tony DeLise: So as I said, it’s a little early to get – to give you more comprehensive guidance into 2020. But on the first part of your question there, the senior higher component, which we did the right thing, we hired Chris. He’s been tremendous. We hired Mike Baker as our new Chief Technology Officer; Oliver Huggins, the new Chief Risk Officer; those were the right things to do. They don’t happen every year. So that step function…
Rick McVey: No, no, you can just stop there. That’s good enough.
Tony DeLise: Okay. Yes. That step function, that was around – right around $10 million in expense in 2019. You tack on the $1.5 million for the LiquidityEdge deal-related costs, you’re close to $12 million. And you look at our historical expense CAGR, even including the $256 million this year, the five-year CAGR has been around 12%. And if you just humor me and you say, you take out the senior higher impact and the impact of the deal cost, you’re down at something like a 9% or 10% increase year-over-year in 2019. So we were actually little bit lower than our five-year CAGR on an adjusted basis. But we’ll definitely provide a lot more information, a lot more color on the January call, including – again, including the view on LiquidityEdge and the amortization of intangibles. I’m just going to stop at that right now.
Operator: At this time, I’m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rick McVey for closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you, again, next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded July 24, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relation Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. For the call Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter; Chris Concannon, President and COO will discuss new initiatives; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2018. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2019 results. This morning we reported strong second quarter results driven by record quarterly trading volume with new volume records in high yield, emerging markets, and Eurobonds. Overall, fully electronic trading volume of $527 billion was up 25% compared to Q2 2018. Open Trading volume was up 46% year-over-year to $131 billion. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share was 18.7%. This quarter trading activity outside of the U.S. reached record levels with international client volume, up 43% to $162 billion. Second quarter revenues were a record $125 million, up 17% compared to Q2 2018. Operating income for the quarter was up 17% to $61 million and diluted EPS was up 19% to $1.27. In addition to the strong quarterly results, we recently received a great news that MarketAxess has been added to the S&P 500 Index. This represents a major accomplishment for our company as we prepare to celebrate our 20th anniversary early next year. Congratulations to all of our employees on this significant achievement. Last week we also announced that Richie Prager has joined our Board of Directors. Richie recently retired from BlackRock, where he was a Senior Managing Director in charge of Global Trading, Liquidity, and Securities Lending. He will be a valuable asset for the company as a new Director. Slide 4 highlights market conditions. Market conditions were mixed during the quarter which makes us feel even better about the results. Credit spreads over treasuries continue to tighten leading to an imbalance of buy orders especially in high yield and EM. We have historically done better in market environments with widening spreads. TRACE volumes remained strong and are up 8% year-over-year. We believe this is due to the strong demand for U.S. credit products and the growing level of trading automation in fixed income. Trading volumes are also undoubtedly benefiting from this significant addition of new entrants in credit trading as a result of the growth in all-to-all trading. The treasury yield curve remains flat, while treasury yields declined from Q1. In this environment, we are pleased to see our average fee capture improve slightly year-over-year. Slide 5 highlights Open Trading activity. Open Trading experienced another strong quarter. Adoption continues to grow with volume of $131 billion, up 46% year-over-year. Open Trading represented 25% of our volume in Q2, up from 21% last year. Over 334,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the second quarter up from 256,000 in Q2 2018. Open Trading liquidity providers or price makers on the platform drove approximately 2.3 million price responses on live orders, up 57% from a year ago. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $49 million in transaction costs through Open Trading on the system, up 27% from the second quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.4 basis points in yield when they completed the U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. In addition, we estimate that liquidity providers saved an estimated $50 million in the quarter, up 46% year-over-year. This is the third quarter in a row where we have delivered estimated total transaction cost savings to our clients of around $100 million. Open Trading volume increased significantly across all four core products with U.S. high-grade up 34%, U.S. high-yield up 49%, emerging markets up 55%, and Eurobonds up 111%. Open Trading has become an important source of new liquidity for credit market participants around the world and is a key competitive advantage for MarketAxess. Slide 6 provides an update on our global network. Our global network of investors, dealers, and alternative market makers continues to expand both domestically and internationally. International trading activity is accelerating on MarketAxess. Trading activity from European clients was especially robust in the second quarter with overall volume up 46% compared to Q2 2018. Eurobond volumes were up an impressive 64% year-over-year. We are confident we are taking meaningful share in European credit e-trading. Emerging market volume was up 27% to $124 billion with a 51% increase in local market EM trading. We now have over 1,600 firms active on the platform globally. We currently have nearly 800 active international client firms, up 26% year-over-year. Across all products, the number of active clients continues to grow sequentially. Penetration across products increased as well with over 900 clients now trading three or more products. We are excited to see the continued growth of our business outside of the U.S. and believe these results confirm that our value proposition is resonating with clients globally. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on trading automation and new initiatives.
Chris Concannon: Thank you, Rick. As you can see, slide 7 demonstrates the growing momentum of automation and credit trading. Automation on the MarketAxess trading platform continues to expand as both dealers and institutional investors rapidly embrace our trading automation tools. The use of dealer algorithms continues to grow with approximately 2.4 million algo responses in Q2, 2019, an 81% increase year-over-year trading at a highly competitive trading environment for our clients. The use of auto-execution functionality on our platform by investors is growing rapidly as well. In Q2, 105,000 investor trades took place using our Auto-Ex feature, up from 37,000 trades in the same period a year ago. This activity was generated by 47 large global asset managers executing trades via auto-execution this quarter, more than double the number of firms using auto-execution in the same period last year. We believe that the cost benefits from improving trading efficiency will continue to drive our investor and dealer clients to higher levels of automation in credit rating, while we continue our investment in innovation in this area. Most importantly, we believe that structural increases in trading automation across the market will lead to higher levels of market turnover as we witnessed in other markets. Slide 8 outlines our new business initiatives and technology solutions. We are working on a number of new initiatives and we would like to highlight several today. We have been analyzing the move to self clearing for some time. Given the continued growth of open trading, we have made the decision to transition to self clearing in the U.S. and engage a new settlement agent outside of the U.S. This transition which we expect to take place in the first half of next year will lead to significant variable cost savings and create a more scalable cost structure. We also believe a new global settlement agent will be critical in expanding our local market coverage in our fast-growing emerging markets business. In terms of new technology enhancements, we are looking forward to the launch of Live Markets later this year. Live Markets is an all-to-all live order book with streaming dealer liquidity that was developed for the institutional market. It will provide on-demand liquidity for our investors and dealer clients, ultimately improving transparency and driving greater transaction cost savings. We will also be launching a portfolio of trading solution to respond to both the recent growth in portfolio trading across the fixed income market and the growth of fixed income ETFs. This solution will create a streamlined protocol for clients to price and transact large customized fixed income portfolios, while demonstrating best execution with competitive pricing and our proprietary data analytics. In the second quarter, we also announced a partnership with Virtu's RFQ hub to deliver institutional investors in new cost-efficient secure solution for achieving quality execution in ETFs. ETFs have grown quickly to become an important feature of the liquidity landscape in the global credit market. We believe our partnership with Virtu will provide our clients with seamless access to a global ETF platform. We are excited to be innovating and investing in technology solutions for our clients that will support the continued evolution of credit trading and we look forward to updating you as these initiatives evolve. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financials in more detail.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Chris. Please turn to slide 9 for summary of our trading volume across product categories. Overall trading volume was up 25% as we experienced healthy volume growth across each of our core four trading products. U.S. high-grade volumes were up 15% year-over-year to $265 billion for the quarter on a combination of a gain in estimated market share and higher U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes. Our other credit category trading volumes were up 40% year-over-year in large part due to gains in estimated market share. Our trading volume gains in emerging markets, U.S. High Yield and European corporate bonds far outpaced the year-over-year rise in estimated market volumes. The results were particularly satisfying for these products, given an inquiry mix during the second quarter that favored client buying. With six important trading days remaining, July month-to-date high-grade market share tracking significantly above the second quarter level and our overall July average daily volume, while lower than the second quarter level is substantially higher than July 2018. On slide 10, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall, revenue was up 17% year-over-year. The 25% increase in trading volume resulted in a 19% uplift in commissions. Information services revenue was up 3% and on a constant currency basis up 6%. Post trade services revenue was up 9% and on a constant currency basis up 16%. Expenses were up 18% and operating income and EBITDA were both up 17% year-over-year. The effective tax rate was 23.5% in the second quarter versus 19.5% in the first quarter. The recognized amount of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards caused the movement in the effective tax rate between the first and second quarters. While the effective tax rate for the first half of the year was 21.5%, we expect our effective tax rate for full year 2019 will be near the low end of the guidance range of 20.5%. Our diluted EPS was $1.27 on a small increase from the diluted share count. On slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 27% year-over-year, largely driven by the 25% increase in trading volume. U.S. high-grade fee per million was up $9 from the first quarter level as the favorable impact from lower yields and slightly longer years to maturity was somewhat offset by a mix shift in trade size buckets. Our other credit category fee per million decreased by $6 on a sequential basis. The contribution to other credit volumes from emerging markets, high yield and European credit was little changed during the quarter. Our shift in dealer mix accounted for a small decline in emerging markets and high-yield fee capture. We had one dealer migrate from the U.S. high-grade distribution fee plan to the all-variable fee plan during the second quarter, which resulted in a sequential decline in U.S. high-grade distribution fees. Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. On a year-over-year basis expenses were up 18% for the quarter, and up 15% year-to-date. Compensation and benefits accounted for more than 60% of the absolute change in expenses for both the quarter and year-to-date as we continue to add personnel to support our growth initiatives. Our year-over-year increase in headcount of 49, higher variable bonus provision and higher stock-based compensation expense were the main contributors to the rise in compensation and benefits. We have freshened up the expense forecast and refined our resource requirements necessary to execute on a variety of important initiatives including those that Chris described and now believe that full year 2019 expenses will end up near the high end of the expense guidance range of $256 million. And just to remind you that the estimated 2019 expense uplift includes approximately $10 million in expense associated with senior hires and retention activity. We don't expect to repeat this type of activity in 2020. On slide 13 we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of June 30th were $518 million and trialing 12 months free cash flow reached a record $196 million. During the second quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $19 million and also repurchased 13,000 shares under our share buyback program. Our growing cash flow from operations allows us to increase investment in organic growth opportunities while simultaneously returning cash to shareholders. Chris commented earlier on our clearing and settlement initiatives. We believe that our regulated businesses that handle mass principal trading have sufficient liquidity and capital to cover any new deposit or reserve requirements in the near-term. We also do not anticipate any change in our shareholder capital return programs. Based on the second quarter results, our board has approved a $0.51 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We're happy with the growth we achieved in Q2 trading volumes, revenues and earnings. Open trading is driving transaction cost savings and our international business has never been stronger. Trading automation is leading to increase client demand for e-trading across products. In this environment of growing client demand we are actively investing in new products and new trading solutions in order to maximize long-term revenue growth opportunities for our shareholders. Now, we will be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes to -- from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Yeah, good morning Rick and Tony and Chris. First congrats on the add of Richie Prager. He's been at the forefront of the convergent to electronics and fixed income. So great addition to your board. I think the first question is on self clearing. Can you approximate the savings that -- maybe I missed it. But can you approximate the savings and when it will be implemented?
Tony DeLise: So Rich, it's Tony. So on the sub-clearing and the clearing initiative, today we use a third-party clearing broker to settle and match principal trades. And when we look at clearing cost as a percentage of open trading revenue that's one of the principal metrics we use, it's been bubbling around 11% or 12% or 13% of open trading revenue. So we're going to move to the self clearing model in the U.S. You also heard that we are changing out settlement agents outside of the U.S. And the cost structure, it will scale better. But even what's important is that it's going to improve customer service and better support our emerging markets initiatives. So we're -- there are multiple benefits here. When we look at clearing cost as a percentage of revenue, you use that metric we believe that we can drive clearing costs in that particular metric into the single digits. So again if it's 11% or 12% or 13%, we think we can get it into the single digits. Exact date it's some time in the first half of the year. It's hard to pin down on an exact date but expect those savings to flow through over the course of 2020.
Chris Concannon: And Rich, it's Chris. I'll just add. It's important to point out that we have a well-capitalized broker-dealer because of the commercial needs when we’re a counterparty to some of the major institutions around the globe. And so that capital is now being deployed as clearing fund deposit for our activity. So we don't see an immediate need to further capitalize the broker-dealer because it is overcapitalized for commercial reasons. And so we're leveraging capital that's sitting on our broker-dealer balance sheet and reducing our variable costs of trading. So it's a great project and one that delivers not only savings but allows us to expand. There is an important point, the change of the global agent that allows us to expand our local markets in EM, which as you can see our EM continues to grow rapidly.
Rich Repetto: Got it. Got it that you're in a unique position there. I guess my follow-up would be this past quarter was -- for those of -- it was unique as far as interest rate movements, the yield curve and then -- I guess the question is on macro, what if we -- is there things to takeaways from what happened in the quarter in regards to the performance either way people trade bond electronically in this type of environment? And the other macro thing I think that's lingering is the potential for hard Brexit now. Could you comment on some of these factors that are out -- that aren't fundamental but certainly would impact you Rick?
Rick McVey: Sure. I'm happy to. Thanks Rich. The macro environment I commented in the prepared remarks, if you look at a quarter like Q4 when spreads were widening significantly that's typically where we deliver the biggest market share gains. So what we are encouraged by when you look at the first half of this year is it's been a consistent spread tightening environment and spreads have basically recovered almost entirely the move from the fourth quarter. So for us to be gaining share and gaining volume the way that we are and what is really an offer wanted environment where there is a search for yield going on globally, it gives us great confidence that we are in the midst of a secular change in client behavior toward more trading automation and electronic trading. Because we look into the second half it's really hard to predict, of course, but we now are at lower levels of spreads and lower levels of yields as you have mentioned. And we would expect as it's normally the case seasonally for new issue volume to be lower in the second half than it was in the first half. With respect to Brexit, we've been preparing for several years and we feel very good that we are ready for any outcome. Clearly, the view is that the odds of a hard Brexit have increased this week, but we are ready to go. We have all of our regulated entities now set up in the Netherlands and we have clients in the EU trading through our MTF in Amsterdam every day. So we are ready to switch over. The liquidity experience is very similar in our Amsterdam MTF as it is in the U.K. And we feel very good about our preparation for Brexit.
Rich Repetto: Got it. Thank you. It was very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. A couple of questions on the new business initiatives. The Live Markets description seems like it would compete a bit more with the banks directly. Just in terms of going after new issue, can you talk about that offering in more detail please?
Chris Concannon: Sure. Live Markets is not designed to compete with the banks. It's actually designed to help the banks provide what they have built on their side which is streaming liquidity, streaming dealer liquidity. We're seeing it today in response to RFQs. So it facilitates both banks and non-banks ability to stream to clients across the most liquid end of the bond market. What's unique about Live Markets, not only does it help facilitate a liquidity being driven from the banks, but it also allows investors to rest orders really for the first time in the bond market. If you think about the overall global market in fixed income, it's driven by a Request-For-Quote, where clients are asking the community for a price. Now our investors with the introduction of Live Markets, clients will be able to place orders in a market that is available to all and that's a critical function that has been missing from the bond market. It's a function that we take for granted in other markets both the future's market where clients can rest orders and obviously the equity market globally where clients can rest orders. We are building a place for clients to rest orders side-by-side with dealers to stream price to clients.
Dan Fannon: Great. A follow-up for Tony, just on expenses. Thinking when you get the high-end for this year, but thinking about next year, where you have the self-clearing coming in, I think you said the rollback of roughly the $10 million retention and obviously the ongoing investment in the core business. And so just directionally or kind of from a growth perspective, how we should think about 2020 from an expense perspective would be helpful?
Tony DeLise: Wow, Dan. It's early to start talking about 2020, at least for some specificity. But I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have the senior higher activity and that retention activity, it's not likely to repeat in 2020 that was around $10 million. And while we're not prepared to give an exact range right now, just a couple of items to think about -- and the first one, we're going to continue to invest. So we're continuing to invest in people and infrastructure to support growth and we believe that's what our shareholders are looking for. We're not playing this for the short term and we want to make sure that we are capitalizing on the opportunity in front of us. So we're going to continue to invest the senior higher activity. While it's in the base, we don't intend on hiring another President although sometimes I do wonder about that, but we're not hiring another President.
Rick McVey: If you hope so.
Tony DeLise: And also you will see while it will not be in Q1 you will see the benefit come through for this clearing initiative and changing clearing arrangements. So you will see that coming through definitely in the back half of the year. I -- it's tough to give you the range right now, but I think all of us would be a little bit surprised if you saw an expense increase like you're seeing this year, up 15% year-over-year again with some of those items that I'm pointing out here. You're not likely to see that repeat again in 2020.
Rick McVey: And Dan, it's important to point out on the self-clearing initiative, it is a lengthy approval process, so it requires your investment at the front end of the process. So people and platforms need to be in position way before launch date. So most of that investment will happen this year and you'll see a run rate in this year that will follow into self clearing in the first half of next year.
Dan Fannon: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. If I could just ask couple of follow-ups on the Live Markets initiatives. I know it's focused on new issues and story bonds. Can you help frame the percentage of total secondary market trading that this offering will address? And then, can you share anything in terms of where you think the net capture rates will shake out and any incentives that may need to be in place for the dealers?
Rick McVey: Sure. Happy to take that one. Kyle, good morning. But as we've said on previous calls Live Markets is really aimed at the very liquid end of corporate bond trading, which historically interestingly enough is not where we have done our best in market share. And part of that market is clearly newly issued bonds and the other are the large benchmark deals that trade in a very liquid way throughout most trading days. And I -- the other clear focus for us in Live Markets is in increasing block trading market share. What we have seen in EM is the investment in the Request-For-Market protocol significantly improved our result in block trades and block trades now make up a significant part of our growth in EM trading especially in local markets. And there is some similarity here with the Live Markets initiative in terms of aiming at the very liquid end of the market and the block trading market. When we try to estimate what percentage of TRACE, if you look at the percentage of trades that we think is attributable to newly issued bonds and benchmark large deals, it's probably around 25% of total TRACE volume. It's difficult to be exact, but it's a significant part of the market. We're active there today, but these protocols we think have a real chance to increase our share in that part of the market. Fee capture, of course is tied to bid offer and bid offer is tighter on these bonds. So we would expect that the combination of larger trades and lower bid offer would suggest that fee capture in this part of the market will be lower, but of course it's all additive top line revenue versus where we are today.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, Rick. Just to clarify, should we be think about maybe half of the fee capture in high grade or is it something lower than that?
Rick McVey: It's too early to know specifics on it. I wouldn't think that that would be too far off the mark, but those details are still in front of us.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Great. And then just -- this may be one on auto-execution. Now it continues to grow really rapidly. But in terms of volume, I think it's still only around 4% of your total volume which is up substantially year-over-year. Just wondering if you could help frame where you think that buy side Auto-Ex can go as a percentage of MarketAxess' total volume? It's something that in three years or five years it could be a quarter or a half their volume or more?
Chris Concannon: Sure. I'll take that. It's Chris. We see client adoption across the board from most of the large fund complexes. Most of that adoption involves smaller ticket sizes either under $1 million or under $2 million. And most of the firms are getting comfortable once they adopt it. We do see firms increasing to penetrate more of their trading activity across investment grade and high yield and we would expect auto-execution to bleed into other products as well. If you think about munis which are much smaller trade size provided you're comfortable with liquidity and the liquidity on the platform and the price that we are delivering you get comfortable with auto-execution. So we see with the clients that have adopted it further penetration higher growth rates which would suggest a much higher percentage of our total volume being Auto-Ex. I think it's important to point out that's that one side of the trade that is the client auto executing their Request-For-Quote and those responses. We still are looking at solutions similar to an auto responder where clients are able to respond to other Request-For-Quote. So there are a variety of auto-execution solutions that we continue to analyze and we continue to hear from the clients that will drive auto-execution to a much higher percentage of our overall volume.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.
Ken Hill: Hey good morning. So my first question is got to go back to the new business initiatives. I know you guys have these opportunities kind of identified. I'm guessing project out and expect that launch here for a couple of launch in the fourth quarter. But if we look beyond that so I guess the kind of next wave of initiatives, what are areas of the market you guys are focused on that seem to be a little bit juicier or right for more investment over time?
Rick McVey: Yes, I think the nice part about the credit space is we see ample opportunity for investment over the next three to five years. We are still in pretty early stages of electronification of the credit markets. Clearly Asia is an area of investment for us given the beginnings of greater electronic trading adoption in the region. And we would also see electronic trading demand growing in additional credit products. We're at very early stages in municipal bond trading, but we like some of the trends and client input that we're getting for our muni bond product. The structured product marketing including asset backs and non-agency mortgages has opportunities to expand electronically. So we're looking at a broad menu of opportunities globally and we're matching that against increased demands for automation coming from both our dealer/investor clients. So it is an attractive space in terms of the number of growth opportunities that we see in front of us.
Chris Concannon: And Rick, I would just add that we're seeing continued growth in our Request-For-Market where clients are requesting a 2-sided market versus single-sided Request-For-Quote. That's been a wonderful driver in Eurobonds and our Emerging Markets growth rates that you've seen here today. So we're expecting further investment in functionality similar to a request from market. And obviously investment in the Auto-Ex features that we just mentioned. I think that's a multi-year investment because clients continue to request small changes small adjustments as we rollout all these features.
Ken Hill: Okay. And one thing that wasn't on the slide but I think you guys had announced earlier in the year was the Refinitiv data partnership. Just wondered if we could get any color on the early traction there that you guys have been getting back?
Rick McVey: Sure. On that -- what's great about data is we continue to produce it without making substantial investment. And it's really about distribution. The Refinitiv relationship is an important relationship for us because of their massive global distribution. We're seeing a lot of activity. Again it takes a fairly long life cycle to sell through that distribution channel, but we're seeing a lot of activity through that distribution channel around our key data products. And -- so we do expect later in the year to see more activity coming out of that relationship.
Ken Hill: Thanks for the detail.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hugh Miller with Buckingham. Your line is open.
Hugh Miller: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I had one around the Eurobond market and obviously that's an area where we've seen greater adoption of electronic trading. You guys have had a lot of success in gaining market share more recently. Just wanted to get a sense of -- if you're seeing competitors in that space react in any way? Are they making changes to their platform to try and protect their share and maybe mimic some of the success that you're having? Are you seeing anything just in terms of the competitive landscape in the Eurobond area?
Rick McVey: I think as we've suggested in past calls that European clients are responding to a couple of parts of our value proposition in European trading. And by the way, it's well beyond Eurobonds. European clients are extremely active in emerging markets trading on MarketAxess as well as U.S. credit trading. But clearly the liquidity solution that we're offering is different from competitors. And the combination of broad-based dealer liquidity and Open Trading liquidity is unique and is driving transaction cost savings. And I think that's a big part of why we're doing better in the European region. I would also point to data we're using data to drive trading activity and market share gains and we have terrific free trade price discovery and data products for European clients including CP+ which has been winning multiple awards this year. It's one of the best real-time pricing tools for the global credit markets. So I think that combination of a unique liquidity pool driving down transaction costs and high-quality reliable free-trade data is really changing the dynamic in the competitive landscape in Europe and it's a meaningful change. You can see that with some of our competitors and the volumes that they are reporting that we are clearly taking share. And we are excited that there is more to come for us given the success that we're having in the European region.
Hugh Miller: Thanks. That's really helpful. And then just on the expense guidance the update there towards the upper end of the range. Is there an assumption just in terms of market activity in the second half of the year relative to the first half? And is it just the change primarily all driven by the increase in the business investments?
Tony DeLise: Hugh, it's Tony. I wouldn't say that it's market activity related one. When we freshened up the forecast for the rest of the year we're looking at the resources required to execute on all of these initiatives. Most of the uplift is people-related, although there is several other line items like clearing costs. Like this clearing initiative there is implementation fees, there is even some occupancy uplift in London. There is various employee benefit programs in transit. There is a number of items that went into the mix. But by and large it is people. That is the swing factor.
Hugh Miller: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Yeah. Just -- Tony just a quick follow-up on the July volumes. You said that they were -- compared to last year they were above it, which is -- the volumes were very weak last year, but down from 2Q pretty wide range I guess. The point is could you get any additional color on volumes July-to-date?
Tony DeLise: Yes. So to give an upper end of the boundary there with 2Q we are at $8.4 billion average daily volume in Q2, and the commentary going to have to decipher what the word substantially higher means, substantially higher than July 2018. It's -- the market environment and the market volumes in July, while down seasonally from June and the second quarter, which happens every July market volumes are actually pretty healthy. So when you look at U.S. high-grade market volume month-to-date it's up about 5%. Now you have to remember, we have six trading days left and we also have the impact of July 3rd and July 5th in there. So market volumes are pretty healthy even in high grade. When you look at high yield emerging markets and Eurobond market volumes month-to-date, all three of them are tracking up more than 20% year-over-year. So, there is -- while we're saying that ADV is tracking below the second quarter, which will be very typical for July, remember we got market volumes in there. We also said that U.S. high-grade market share is tracking well above the second quarter. So hard to be not more specific than that, but we kind of put a little bit of a boundary on it for you.
Rick McVey: And remember Rich, you see this across all of your market structure platforms, but at this point July, the two holiday impacted trading days July 3rd and July 5th are heavily weighting down market volumes, but that will improve as the month goes on. So, you did have two quiet days around the 4th, but the trends are really positive as Tony pointed out on market share. And overall, if you look year-over-year market share gains are looking really solid. So we're encouraged and the quarter is off to a good start.
Rich Repetto: Got it. Got it. It seems like every Monday is weighing on market volumes as well, but anyway. The question I have is for Chris and as you go to a streaming platform -- I guess -- and it's for Rick as well. The question is how much of a market do you think -- do you think this will be a significant play? Or like say in U.S. equities where Chris comes from would it be like a small portion like dark pool volumes? Because it also seems like you have more competition in the streaming that have streaming platforms already, but fairly don't have the liquidity you have in the RFQ model? Just trying to see how much of a competitive -- how much you can take it? And how much of a competitive moat you have?
Chris Concannon: So it's a good question. Obviously, we think Live Markets is an important feature that we're delivering to the global credit market. It's something that our clients don't see anywhere else and they don't have access to something like it. So it is unique for the global credit market. We do think it will ramp up quite slowly as dealer’s get comfortable pricing on a streaming credit platform and as clients get more comfortable using Click-To-Trade something that's new to them as well. I just think the innovation is really allowing clients to market their interest, their pricing interest in bonds. If you think about your average portfolio, there is an offer in that portfolio on every bond in the portfolio that has no place to be placed in the market unlike most other instruments that they trade in those large managed funds. So it is a unique innovation in the corporate bond market to allow an investor to reflect their pricing interest in a bond and have it sit either the full size or a small size with hidden liquidity behind it. So I think it's going to allow us to drive innovation across the bond market because of the functionalities that we can embed in that market once it's up and running. But again, I want to make sure it's clear like, we do think it will take time for this market to develop on Live Markets. We are targeting a small subset of other bond market, which is the most liquid end of the bond of market. And we're allowing an important functionality in the market. The Live Markets functionality is that dealers can stream their prices in and that's something we already see them doing in Request-For-Quote. They are responding with an automated market price. And so we're just allowing that functionality to bleed into Live Markets.
Rick McVey: And Rich remember when you talk about competition for streaming, streaming today is primarily in the REITs market not in credit. So we believe that the network that we've established in the significant advantage that we have in client order flow gives us a great head start in leading the move toward more automated means of trade through Live Markets and streaming quotes. So it's been a very liquid market phenomena so far, and we think now at the liquid end of corporate bonds, the market investment in automation means that it's ready to start moving toward corporate bonds.
Rich Repetto: Got it. One last quick question. Why would someone request a two-sided quote? Would it be simply just to hide their intentions?
Rick McVey: It's primarily -- it has much less information leakage that the client likes to basically camouflage the side of the market that they intend to trade on and request a two-sided market. And by the way, we get positive feedback from the dealer community, because it works for them because you don't have the winner's curse where everyone knows which side of the market they traded on. So in certain products like EM, it's proven to be very popular with both investors and dealers.
Rich Repetto: Understood. Thanks for the follow-up information. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Hey, thanks a lot guys. Just – I think a lot of questions has been asked here. I hopped on a little bit late. I just wanted to talk a little bit about portfolio trading and maybe what the opportunity you guys see there. I presume, it goes a little bit hand-in-hand with your Virtu partnership. So maybe any color on REIT sort of volumes from both of those items? And if it will compete with, or kind of dovetail with ICE's intention to launch their fixed income credit rating ETF hub at some point in the future?
Chris Concannon: Great question. The portfolio trading, we see portfolio trading happening in the market on an average trading day. We continue to hear from our clients, how they are constructing portfolio trades and putting up portfolio trades. Right now, the efficiency of that process just the workflow is very difficult for both client and dealer, because it's passing spreadsheets back and forth. What's unique about our portfolio trading solution is it's leveraging some of the functionality that we already have things like list trading. And it's allowing an investor to market a portfolio request prices across the portfolio on a single net basis, so they can market their portfolio at not just one dealer price respond, but multiple dealers price respond, which is a very important best execution functionality in the credit market. Then it allows for investors to manage that large portfolio and show it to dealers across our platform. So that's a unique solution. We continue to hear from our clients asking for the functionality. So that's one of the reasons why we are driving to deliver that. On the unique data analytics that we can provide not only do we have our Composite+ pricing that helps you price the portfolio, but as part of the Virtu partnership, we are delivering an eNAV pricing solution that we expect to be out in the fall and that will help people price in portfolios relative to portfolios of ETFs. So there will be the ability to compare the live eNAV as part of the Virtu relationship with a portfolio that you're pricing, if it's an index-based portfolio.
Jeremy Campbell: And if ICE got there they are hell off a ground I assume this would probably – you're already the liquidity provider for high-grade and high-yield fixed income so we might see incremental flow done portfolio trading side come through you guys in that pipe?
Chris Concannon: Yeah. We believe this is obviously capturing trades that are being conducted today in the market that we're not seeing. We do see parts of those trades really the follow-on. As the portfolio is unwound by a dealer, we'll see certain elements of that portfolio trade coming through our platform. But today, we see trades going up on TRACE that we're not participating in and that's really the driver to deliver this. It also will reduce the inefficiencies around the workflow for our clients, because it will seamlessly go through our trade reporting and our clearing solutions for our clients and flow back into their own assets. And so that's one of the drivers that we see the opportunity. Now, we do think that it will allow for – because it is efficient, and given the growth of the ETF, fixed income ETF trading we do think it will allow our clients to trade more portfolios that they are not currently trading. So we do think it will create trades that don't – haven't happened in the market today.
Jeremy Campbell: And Tony, I think you had mentioned that some of the expenses to build out the clearing the self clearing side of things is already kind of contemplated in the higher end of the 2019 guide. But I think it was also mentioned that self clearing is a bit of a lengthy approval process. So I'm just wondering is MarketAxess currently running with some sort of redundancies or is that yet to come at this point? Just trying to figure out, how much more it will cost to build out the self clearing versus the savings you're going to see there?
Tony DeLise: Yeah. So it's important to point out that the self clearing – the majority of the cost will not the variable cost, but the fixed cost to build out will be contained in 2019 meaning headcounts that we need to add people and employees and specialists that support the clearing function. Because of lengthy approval process, they expect to have all your people and processes in place and the ability to run tests trades through the clearing cycle, that all needs to be done at the front-end of the approval process. So I expect the majority of those fixed cost expenses to be incurred in 2019. In 2020, when you make the switch you are running really a redundant self-clearing operation as well as outsourcing your clearing to a third-party that's when the switch takes place and really you see the benefit of reduced variable cost coming through and what we are predicting is first half of 2020.
Rick McVey: Yeah. And just to follow on that we look at three to five year expense savings from trade settlement combined with the improvement in customer service. This is a very high ROI activity. So we feel very good about what we're doing and we think that this will make a significant difference in our margins as we continue to expand Open Trading.
Jeremy Campbell: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.
Chris Allen: Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the commentary you made earlier just about taking share and EM and Eurobo. EM it sounds like you're taking – you're seeing increased block activity. I am wondering, if that's coming from local or global dealers. And Eurobonds is taking it from some of the existing electronic platforms. Any color there would be helpful.
Rick McVey: Sure. On EM, and we've talked about this in prior quarters as well, but we do think that the investment we've made now over 19 years is created a really unique global EM solution and the liquidity comes from a combination of the large global dealers active in EM, and importantly, in local markets a lot of the local banks that make markets in those currencies. So that – it's a time-consuming exercise to work our way around the world and now we have 26 active local EM markets. And you put the global dealers, the local dealers and in some markets now we're even able to apply the benefits of Open Trading and you have a really unique liquidity solution that's highly efficient for EM trading for our clients. So it is a combination there. When you look at Eurobonds, the rapid growth that we've seen over the last four to six quarters to us clearly reflects that we are gaining significant share. And from some of the competitor reports, we see their volumes in euro is going the other way. So, when we look at combined ADV and Euros EM and U.S. credit, we feel increasingly positive about our market position in Europe and we think that there is still a significant growth opportunity in front of us with clients really embracing the liquidity solution that we are offering.
Tony DeLise: And Chris, I would just point out from a competitive standpoint; we are competing against platform study. There are three. We're at a lower cost. So, really, our clients are seeing the benefits of the trade outcome, their net savings, when you factor in those costs and that's a huge driver of our growth, our competitive growth. So we are growing against platforms that are charging either no cost or a lower rate. And I think in emerging markets as Rick pointed out, a key benefit for our global clients is the unique liquidity pool that we have amassed. These are local dealers quoting on a platform and the benefits for those local dealers is they have access to a network of clients that they would need to arm sales forces across the globe to obtain those clients. So we're really a network for the local dealers and that's why we've had great success on onboarding those local dealers. They in return are providing unique pricing in our emerging markets complex and so we're really getting the benefit of the network that has taken years to build. And again, I have to point out, we are growing against a competition despite lower cost and when it comes to fees from the competition.
Chris Allen: And then, just the change in the global third party, talk about it from a clearing perspective like how that's going to help you support EM where it's moving forward? Is that going to help you penetrate new markets or just deeper penetration in these existing markets? Any color there would be helpful. And that’s it for me.
Chris Concannon: Sure. It's really two benefits. One is we do get a lower cost of our current activity across the local markets today. So, we are achieving some lower variable fees for our emerging markets business and our European business. More importantly, it does access further local markets beyond the current local markets that we offer. So, we're excited about the growth opportunity that it provides, but also providing us with a cost savings at the same time.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey good morning guys. So curious on what your current thoughts are on opportunity with Chinese bonds. I think particularly now that U.S. rating agencies that are going to be allowed to rate onshore Chinese corporate debt?
Rick McVey: I think it's a significant new opportunity for global fixed income investors and also for us and it's extremely early days in the opening up of the Chinese market. And as you know Patrick, that is being done through their Bond Connect hub. We have increasing dialogue with the decision-makers at Bond Connect, both PBOC and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. And we are optimistic that they are increasingly aware of the global order flow that we can help to deliver for our onshore Chinese government bond trading. But when you look at the size of that market, it will be one of the new fixed income trading opportunities available to investors around the world.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great. Thanks, Rick. And then, maybe Chris to follow up on something that you said earlier. You kind of talked about your belief that electronification will result in increased trading velocity or turnover. Do you think that we're seeing signs of this already taking place? Or is it more that it's your expectation that it will take place going forward?
Chris Concannon: I do think the turnover is showing signs of an increase in turnover, if you look at the new issue market declining with the overall turnover -- year-over-year comparison. So, I do think we're seeing signs of it, but when I look at the automation that we're delivering today, it's still so small compared to what we can deliver as a platform. I have higher hopes that that turnover will increase as we make it more efficient. Really when you look at when automation has been delivered in other markets in the future's market in particular when you went from a floor-based market to an electronic market, two things happened. One, fees obviously, the cost of trading and the efficiency of trading increased, the cost of trading decreased, but more importantly the spread decreased. And that allowed clients to have higher turnover trades that didn't exist in the more -- less-efficient market suddenly started to exist. And we do believe there are portfolio trades out there that PMs want to make, but right now the cost of flipping from one bond to another is too costly. And those trades will happen as we reduce the spread across the market and deliver more automation to the workflow of those portfolio managers. So, I think there are signs of it, but when I look at what we have done in automation while I'm excited about the volume it's still small and still early days. And I really feel like, many of the major markets players are still testing out that automation tool. So there are signs, but it's still early days.
Rick McVey: And Patrick, I'll just follow on that. In addition to the growing automation story that Chris outlined, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are definitely benefiting from the influx of new significant market participants to credit that really couldn't participate in the old model. And not only have we seen a nice increase over the last two years, the pipeline of new participants that we see, that we expect to come in over the next two or three quarters is also meaningful. So, I think the opening up of market through -- the market through all-to-all protocols is really building a much stronger base for market turnover in the future.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great. Thank you, very much.
Operator: Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rick McVey for any further comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you very much for joining us this morning and enjoy the rest of the summer. We'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, April 24, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to David Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead sir.
David Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess' first quarter 2019 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Chris Concannon, President and COO also joins us for Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended, December 31, 2018. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results driven by record trading volumes across our core products and record open trading activity. Overall, fully electronic trading volume of $526 billion was up 13% compared to Q1 2018. U.S. high-grade, U.S. high-yield emerging markets and Eurobonds all experienced record volume and open trading also had a record quarter with volume up 66% year-over-year to $134 billion. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share was 17.6%. Based on available data for fully electronic institutional corporate bond volumes in the U.S. and Europe in Q1, we believe our leadership position grew substantially year-over-year. This quarter trading activity outside of the U.S. reached record levels with international client volume up 18% to $154 billion. First quarter revenues were record $124 million up 9% compared to Q1 2018. Operating income for the quarter was also a record $63 million and diluted EPS was up 9% to $1.39. In addition to the financial results, we are also pleased at Nancy Altobello to our Board of Directors. Nancy brings more than 3 decades of global audit and talent management experience to our Board from EY. In our last call at EY, Nancy served as Global Vice Chair of Talent where she led the firm's global talent initiatives. Slide 4 highlights market conditions. Our record results were achieved this quarter in spite of market conditions that do not typically work in our favor. Unlike the fourth quarter, when we set new records for market share, the Q1 environment featured a risk on sentiment and rapidly narrowing credit spreads. In this kind of market, new issue, corporate bond demand runs very high and secondary trading flows move to buy orders for scarce bonds. It is encouraging to see record MarketAxess volumes and strong growth rates during this period. High-grade new issue levels were very similar to one-year ago. High-grade trade's volume rose sharply, we believe due to strong domestic and international demand for U.S. corporate bonds. The treasure yield curve remains flat leading to slightly shorter years to maturity for bonds traded on the system. Slide 5 highlights open trading activity; open trading experienced another strong quarter. Adoption continues to accelerate with record volume of $134 billion up 66% year-over-year while average daily open trading volume surged to $2.2 billion. Open trading represented 26% of our volume in Q1 up from 17% last year. Over 344,000 open trading transactions were completed in the first quarter up from 204,000 in Q1 2018. Open trading liquidity providers or price makers on the platform drove approximately $2 million price responses on live orders, nearly doubling the level of activity a year ago. During the quarter, approximately 855 firms provided liquidity through open trading. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $51 million in transaction costs through open trading on the system up 59% from the first quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.6 basis points in yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through open trading protocols. In addition, we estimate that liquidity providers saved an estimated $44 million in the quarter up 48% year-over-year. Open trading volume continues to grow across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace open trading as an important source of liquidity. Slide 6 provides an update on international progress. Our international business experienced another quarter of strong growth. We are especially gratified with results in Europe where we have had 32% compound annual growth rate in fully electronic trading volume over the last three years and feel confident, we are strengthening our competitive in the region. European client volumes increased by 23% compared to Q1 2018 with Eurobond volumes up 32% year-over-year. Emerging market volume was up 10% with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets where we currently operate. We now have over 780 international client firms active on the platform representing a 33% increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Activity from international clients now represents 29% of all trading volume on the platform. It's worth noting that in preparation for Brexit, we successfully launched our new EU based MTF arm and APA regulated entities this quarter. We believe our continued investment in the talent and technology required to capture the international credit trading opportunity significantly expands the long-term growth potential for our shareholders. Slide 7 demonstrates the benefits of greater automation and credit trading. Growing automation on the MarketAxess trading platform is creating a highly competitive environment including small micro-light orders. We are seeing both dealer and investor clients rapidly embrace trading automation tools. The use of dealer algorithms has grown rapidly with approximately 2.2 million algo responses in Q1, a 126% increase year-over-year. U.S. high-grade increased to 720,000 in the quarter, 17 market making firms are now providing algo generated responses versus 13 firms active in the same period last year. In Q1, 83,000 investor trades took place using auto execution functionality on the platform up from 7000 trades in the same period a year ago. This activity was generated by 46 large global asset managers executing trades via auto execution this quarter. For reference, the number of firms using auto execution in the same period last year was 14. We believe that cost benefits and trading efficiency will continue to drive investor and dealer clients to higher levels of automation and credit trading and we will continue our investment in this area. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Overall, trading volumes up 13% despite the narrowing spread environment that Rick mentioned earlier. U.S. hybrid volumes were up 11% year-over-year to $277 billion for the quarter driven by the increase in estimated U.S. high-grade trade volumes. Our other credit category trading volumes were up 17% year-over-year on advances and estimated market share. Our trading volume gains in emerging markets, U.S. high-yield and European corporate bonds far outpaced estimated changes in market volumes. Eurobond trading was a standout this quarter posting a 36% increase in trading volume on an estimated 2.6 percentage point increase in market share. April market conditions look similar to the first quarter, but April U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes are both tracking down around 8% from Q1 levels. While April months-to-date high-grade market share and overall average daily volume are tracking lower than the first quarter. Our overall April ADV is currently more than 20% higher than April 2018. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 9% year-over-year, a 13% increase in trading volume resulted in 10% uplift in commissions. Information services revenue was up 4% and on a constant currency basis up 8%. Excluding one-time MiFID II implementation fees recognized in the first quarter of 2018 and foreign currency impact post trade services revenue was up slightly year-over-year. Expenses were up 12% and operating income was up 5% year-over-year. EBITDA was up 8% and reached a record $71 million in Q1. The effective tax rate was 19.5% in the first quarter. In Q1, we recognized $3 million in excess tax benefits related to share based compensation awards. Our diluted EPS was $1.39 on a stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 12% year-over-year as a 13% increase in trading volume was offset by slightly lower overall fee capture. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down slightly from the fourth quarter and this favorable impact of lower yields was offset by a mixed shift in trade size buckets. Our other credit category fee per million decreased by $12 on a sequential basis solely due to a shift in product mix. There was little change in the fee capture at the individual product level during the quarter. As discussed in the January earnings call, we had one dealer migrate from the U.S. high grade distribution fee plan to the all variable fee plan effective January 1, resulting in a sequential decline in U.S. high-grade distribution fees. Our strong volume growth led to a sequential reduction in unused minimum fees in the other credit category. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially expenses were up 5% largely due to higher compensation and benefits cost of $4.9 million offset by lower marketing and advertising costs of $1.2 million, an increase in employment taxes and benefits reflecting the typical first quarter seasonality, higher variable bonus accrual on improved financial results, an increase in headcount and wage rate and higher stock-based compensation related to senior higher awards each contributed to the compensation and benefits increase. On a year-over-year basis expenses were up 12%. The increase in compensation and benefits represented almost 60% of the absolute change in expenses. A year-over-year increase in headcount of 47 coupled with higher stock-based compensation expense was the main contributors to the rise in compensation and benefits. The increase in open trading activity accounted for the year-over-year uplift in clearing costs. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of March 31 were $483 million and trailing 12-month free cash flow reached a record $182 million. During the first quarter, we paid out year-end employee bonuses and related taxes of roughly $33 million and a quarterly cash dividend of $19 million. We also repurchased 81,000 shares in total during the quarter including 23,000 under our share buyback program and 58,000 associated with tax obligation, net downs upon vesting of employee stock awards. Our new $100 million share repurchase program went into effect at the beginning of April. Effective January 1, we adopted a new lease accounting standard requiring the recognition of operating lease, assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Adoption of the new standard did not have an impact on regulatory capital requirements. Based on the first quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.51 regular quarterly dividend. Now, I'm going to turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results demonstrate the resilience and consistency of our growth rates across a variety of market environments. We are encouraged by the ongoing growth in international client activity as well as open trading. The investor investment in trading automation provides evidence of an inflection point for electronic trading in global credit markets. Our growth agenda continues to expand with new initiatives in data, trading and ETFs. Of note, recently we are pleased to partner with Refinitiv for data distribution and with Virtu for ETF share trading. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Hey. Thank you. So the IPO of a competitor of yours obviously brought a lot of attention to the electronic fixed income trading space. I'm just kind of wondering if you could share an updated view on the competitive dynamics in the space are now?
Rick McVey: Sure. Thanks Jeremy. Happy to start with that. And let me start by congratulating Lee and Billy and the entire Tradeweb team on a highly successful IPO. They had a tremendous year in 2018 and it's another sign of the investor demand that exists for quality fixed income electronic trading businesses, so well done to the team there. It does provide further insight on the competitive landscape in institutional credit and their way of presenting financial information differs from ours. But I do think there are ways to get to pretty good estimates that provide some apples-to-apples comparisons. And the first one that I would look at Jeremy really starts with the revenue section on credit, which last year for Tradeweb was right around $140 million. But it does include all three client segments, the retail business, the interdealer voice brokerage business as well as the institutional electronic trading business. And if you think about parsing those three, the information we have has the retail business at about $78 million or a little over half of that $140 million. It's hard to know exactly where interdealer voice brokerage is, but we estimate $10 million to $15 million per year is probably a good guess. So that combination gets you to $90 million and what is left that is about $50 million in annual revenue for global institutional electronic trading. We would attribute about half of that to corporate bonds or $25 million a year and the other half to CDS and SDP business. And apologies that we don't have the estimates right, but I think that's one way of thinking about it. And what it reflects is what we've known all along that Tradeweb has a very strong business and institutional rates through the acquisition of BondDesk now an important business in retail. But the true institutional electronic credit trading business is further down the line and we believe represents something around 3% of total company revenue. So, that would also demonstrate that the area of overlap is just not that great. Growth rates very good in both cases, but the area of overlap in institutional corporate bond trading is probably not that great. The other place I would look is really the volume reports that we and Tradeweb both put out every month. And the three credit products where we compete with Tradeweb for institutional electronic business or U.S. high-grade, U.S. high-yield and Eurobond credit. And if you look at those three for the first quarter and the numbers that Tradeweb has already put out, the fully electronic high-grade business was $478 million ADV or up about $120 million year-over-year. The U.S. high-yield number was roughly flat at about $53 million, but euro credit went the other way. I do believe that their reporting mechanics are different for European credit than they are in the U.S. because we have not been able to find a split between electronic business and STP for euro credit. But the full number was down $280 million year-over-year about 18%. And we just took an estimate that 40% of that electronic is electronic and about 60% STP. But if you put those three together what it would suggest is that the volume in those three credit products for institutional electronic trading was flat year-over-year. And as you know from our numbers year-over-year and just those three products our ADV was up $800 million year-over-year. So this is what led to the comment that we are more confident than ever of our competitive position in fully electronic trading and in the institutional credit markets. And Jeremy just one other thing that might provide some clues on the space that I would guide you to is that the retail platforms as well as the interdealer electronic venues and some of the institutional cross matching systems are all registered and report to TRACE as ATS. And if you look at ATS volume much of it in the retail space you will see that year-over-year their work growth rates which I think is another sign of the demand for U.S. credit in all client segments. But TRACE as you probably know also carries a flag on whether the volume is D-to-D or client to dealer trading. And what's interesting about the aggregate ATS volumes that were reported to TRACE in Q1, is one it represents 4.4% market share of all of TRACE and within that 96% of that volume was reported as D-to-D and only 4% is client business. So when you think about the other source of competition that has been talked about coming from platforms like Tradeweb retail or TMC or BondPoint or the interdealer venues. The lesson there is that today is still almost entirely D-to-D business. And there's very little evidence of institutional clients operating within those ATS venues. The RFQ platforms or Tradeweb institutional MarketAxess, Bloomberg are primarily regulated as broker dealers today do not report as ATS. So those volumes are separate from the ATS numbers I just gave you.
Jeremy Campbell: Got it. Thanks so much for the detailed color there. just quick follow-up I guess on the auto execution, auto response side of the business here. I know you guys mentioned that the number of firms increased both for brokers and the buy side. How do you envision that involving over the coming year with the words either greater usage of those already -- using it already or signing on new brokers or asset managers and maybe the impact you think it might have on your market share?
Chris Concannon: It's Chris. I'll take that one. So, this is an exciting area because really what we hear mostly from our clients both dealer and the buy side is, how to reduce the friction around their trading day and much of that is delivered through auto execution services, so you can you can certainly have an RFQ market, but how you interact on that RFQ market can be automated to a point where we have clients that are even having a no touch experience on some of their auto execution. So I see it as just dramatic upside in our market for not only the growth of our clients remember it's around 46 clients today are using our Auto-Ex features that's out close to 1500 clients globally. So we have a long road ahead of auto execution growth. But, what it does, it reduces their daily job of executing orders across a very diverse market of products. So and it's one thing where you hear about expense reductions on the buy side, they are reducing -- looking to reduce how much, how many people they put on their desk to solve the broad number of products that they have to trade. So I would say the demand is high and getting higher. And it's not just from the buy side, it's also from our dealer clients looking to increase their ability to have algos on the platform.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Yes. Good morning guys. My question is, just on the topic we were just on the automated trading. And Rick, you mentioned that you feel like we're at an inflection point and I guess what jumped out at me was the number of trades. I was just trying to see how the number of trades, it's up 11x or 12x year-over-year. What was it last quarter? And just further color and I see open trading was much more resilient than we thought it would be. It's still holding at 26%. So I guess more color on this inflection point you think we're reaching in automation.
Rick McVey: Yes. I think page seven goes to your first question Rich and good morning. Auto-Ex in the fourth quarter that the trade count was around 60,000, so Q1 does represent another big increase sequentially. And these are early days, so these numbers we think can go significantly higher because the asset managers are very, very focused on trading efficiency right now and to the extent that they can fully automate the low impact smaller ticket, it makes a big difference to trading efficiency. And I would point out that what is enabling this to happen is the quality of our real-time data. So you see composite price plus in particular as a primary driver in how investors think about their willingness to execute on an automated basis relative to where they would have expected the responses to come back. So I'd say, it's a combination of the investment we've made in data plus the technology to help them. But our expectation would be based on the conversations we're having with lots of large asset managers as those numbers will be substantially higher in the quarters ahead. And you see the same thing on the dealer side; three years ago, we had very little sign of algo trading in credit. And you see over two million algo responses in a quarter and 17 firms now making markets with algos. That's an enormous sea change. And we are just so excited about the investment in automation that we see by both dealer and investor clients.
Rich Repetto: Got it. Thanks Rick for pointing out the chart that you have right there on page 7. That helps. And anyway, the follow-up question would be -- the market share -- you comment on market share in April to-date I guess and be down in 1Q that would be -- it seems a little surprising given the march trends as well as what we see in April. And did you talk about -- did you mention duration and the pricing, I didn't hear -- I'm not sure whether I caught all that on April?
Tony DeLise: Yes. So, Rich, it's Tony. On April, the one prepared remark we said was that market conditions look similar to the first quarter. And what that means in a more granular level, if you look at the nature of the flow on the platform, it is continues to favor the offer wanted side. You know that the hit rates are lower on the offer wanted side versus the bid wanted side. So that trend continues. We continue to see narrowing spreads, which again a more favorable environment for us would be spread gapping out or more volatility and new issuance has been fairly healthy in April. The other pieces coming through in April which is a continuation of Q1 is that a block percent of U.S. high-grade is up at about 46%. So that would be close the high watermark. So, for us market conditions continue to be not as constructive as what you saw say in the first quarter of '18 or the fourth quarter of '18. So it is a continuation of the less constructive conditions you saw in the first quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dan Fannon: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could expand a bit on Slide 6 on the international progress and kind of talk about some of the higher level trends. I was wondering if MiFID or any regulatory changes also part of the kind of pickup that you saw here in first quarter and really over the last several quarters.
Rick McVey: I wouldn't really say that that MiFID this time around is driving any trading behavior changes with clients. That was an impact Q1 or Q2 last year, would MiFID II first went into place. The things that I would point to is clearly European investors and dealers are now benefiting from the expansion of open trading in Eurobonds and emerging markets. So that differentiator in terms of our liquidity pool and driving down transaction costs is clearly one of the main factors that is allowing us to take share from key competitors in Europe. Secondly, we made big investments in protocols. We've done some new things around open trading protocols specific to European clients as well as in EM. And then, I would reiterate that the third piece that has surprised some market participants is that the quality and breadth of our real-time data for European clients is far greater than what's available through the APAs from MiFID II currently. And that's because the vast majority of corporate bonds are not deemed liquid by the regulators currently, so they don't qualify for real-time reporting. So our investment in CP+ and Axess all to provide real-time data tools we think is also part of what's driving clients to use MarketAxess more each quarter.
Dan Fannon: Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tony just a question on expenses. The run rate from the first quarter is tracking towards the low-end of guidance just any color in terms of how the year is progressing on expenses?
Tony DeLise: Yes, Dan. So, you're right. If you took the first quarter and you simply multiplied by four you're going to get to the low-end of the guidance range. But when we think about this year and we've talked about this on the January call, the investments that we're making to expand our addressable market, expand the geographic reach, support new products and protocols, all of that is embedded in the expense guidance. And at this point when you fast forward for the rest of the year there's -- you'd typically talk about three variables and the one big variable would be about around headcount. And right now headcount -- the headcount hiring are on track with our plans. We do have expectations that we're going to grow headcount throughout the balance of the year. So we're -- we feel good about the headcount numbers that. The other variable typically is around variable compensation and we had a very good first quarter and April right now what we said was April volumes are tracking up 20% over April of last year. We expect to continue to deliver. So the view on the variable compensation is consistent with where we had planned. The other factor in there will be around foreign exchange, we do have 50 million sterling of expenses. So that that FX movement could influence expenses up or down, right now, FX rate is tracking close to budget. So I know looking at the consensus estimate, I think everybody as a group or probably more toward the lower half of the range than in the middle or upper half of the range. We're still comfortable with the range that we provided.
Dan Fannon: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. Just on the ETF platform. Can you just or the agreement with Virtu, [indiscernible] demand from your clients for that offering. I suspect just adding functionality for credit traders get access to credit ETF, but I wasn't sure if it's more broad-based than that.
Chris Concannon: It's Chris. Thanks Kyle. Yes. It's been -- the demand has been quite high for some time. We've been looking at a variety of different solutions including building our own solution. But given the economics and ETF share trading and the economics in building new solutions for credit trading obviously partnering with someone made a lot of sense. And so, RFQ hub which is now owned by Virtu through their acquisition of ITG was really a great partner, a great offering provided an RFQ experience which is similar to the RFQ experience that our clients are currently accustomed to. And the clients have been asking for a real focus on ETF trading -- fixed income ETF in particular and it's really targeted at our clients that are on our platform to remain on our platform, so they can access the ETF market directly through our platform. And it just makes their life much easier while giving them a very competitive solution with a lot of liquidity.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Thank you. And then, just a follow up, I just wanted -- on the Eurobond, I know, we spoke a lot about it already, but just the open trading there continues said to take hold. I think just two years ago is the low single digit range in terms of open trading penetration in that Eurobond business and move substantially higher. And I think even grown sequentially from 4Q to 1Q as well. Just wondering if you could provide some commentary around the competitive dynamics not just between you and Tradeweb what you've given already, but between you and Bloomberg, is the larger player there on the Eurobond side. Just wondering how sustainable you believe the competitive maybe market share shift is here in terms of staying ahead of Bloomberg and in terms of protocol technology and open trading liquidity pool and suggesting that they can do from a competitive standpoint to kind of slow the market share shift.
Rick McVey: Sure. Happy to take that one. We're very happy we got out in front on all to all trading or open trading five or six years ago and it's is a major investment as you know Kyle and it involves lots of work in technology, lots of work in risk management and the infrastructure, lots of client documentation. And so, we do believe that we've got a significant lead in the all dollar open trading space for institutional credit. I'm sure that our competitors are well aware of the progress that we're making in Europe and the growth there. I am not aware of any plans by Bloomberg to move into all to all which of course would require that they really establish a full fledged broker dealer and make all the investments in infrastructure to go there, which we have not seen yet. I would expect that with the new ownership structure Tradeweb will have more flexibility on determining their own path around all to all trading. So, we are expecting that all competitors will continue to invest more. Given the success that we are having and the growing demand from both dealers and investors, it's clearly here to stay and you're seeing a total transformation as the market making model in institutional credit where ETF shares are very much in the mix, electronic trading is growing all to all is an important source of liquidity. Portfolio trading is getting more active and we are right at the center of that and we would expect it to continue to grow.
Chris Concannon: And Rick I would just add, in Europe, we're seeing a high demand for the auto execution features. We certainly see many of the dealers providing algos on our platform. So the demand for electronic execution in the Eurobond market is quite high and growing. So I think the overall market that market share which is electronic in Europe is growing to our benefit. We are clearly growing in share, but also growing and converting the market to an electronic solution. And that's some of the benefit that we're feeling in Europe.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Good morning. So, maybe a market structure question for your Rick. In other fixed income asset classes and one thing in particular treasuries, we've seen -- [indiscernible] providers like liquidity edge really start to make some inroads. Do you think that sort of market solution is a viable solution in the core bond space or because the core bond universe is so fragmented and illiquid, it just really wouldn't work.
Rick McVey: Well, I think a little bit of both. When we really think about live market environments, we believe that the most liquid corporate bonds and especially new issues could move in that direction. And we also see automation really having a huge impact on small ticket. So, I think that there are parts of the market that could go that way. The number of bonds that are liquid enough on a regular basis in corporates is a small subset though, you see somewhere around 30 to 50 bonds that have enough turnover during the day where they could actually operate in [indiscernible] central limit order book model. So I don't think it's likely to take hold broadly throughout corporates, but there are segments of the market where automation could lead us in that direction.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. Thanks. And then, just curious about industry wide corporate bond volumes, most asset classes volumes were down pretty significantly year-over-year on the first quarter in corporate bonds and I think in particular high-grade or kind of outlier with industry-wide volumes up pretty nicely in the first quarter. Any sense of kind of what is driving that and I guess maybe to that point is growing electrification now starting to have an impact on trading velocity do you think?
Rick McVey: Very much thanks for the question because that is our belief and it follows on the comments I just made about the market making model changing. And look there's no doubt that corporate bond demand was running extremely high in Q1 not just in the U.S. but internationally. It was all triggered by the rapid shift in central bank policy and the messaging from the Fed and elsewhere about concerns about the economy and slowing down the move toward higher rates. And what that triggered, for one example Patrick is the amount of government debt around the world trading in negative yields spiked from around $8 trillion back up to almost $11 trillion. And that triggers a lot of demand for U.S. credit. So that's clearly one of the drivers. But, what I really like about what we see is that the amount of corporate bond debt outstanding in the U.S. year-over-year was up about 6%, but TRACE volume was up 14%. And I think that's exactly to your point that we're now moving to a new model with investors and dealers embracing new ways of transferring risk including electronic trading and all dollar trading that is starting to have a positive impact on overall market turnover. And that could be a very positive thing for our business because those turnover rates have generally been trending lower since the financial crisis. And I do believe now with new entrants in the market combined with greater levels of automation we may be at the beginning stages of now starting to see those turnover numbers head back higher.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Hugh Miller with Buckingham. Your line is now open.
Hugh Miller: Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the insight you brought it on the Virtu agreement that I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more sense of the partnership with Refinitiv to redistribute any market data. I know you guys have great connections with the vast majority of institutional investors, but how do we think about Refinitiv extending your reach and any benefit that we should expect on non-commercial revenue growth?
Chris Concannon: Sure. It's Chris. I'll take that. So, we're excited about the Refinitiv data distribution agreement. Refinitiv has been a great partner. We look forward to this partnership going forward and that's really how it's structured. It is a revenue split between us and Refinitiv on future sales of our and distribution of our data products. These are our most popular data products CP+, Axess All available on the Refinitiv platform. They clearly have a unique distribution channel out to both vendors -- other third party vendors, but obviously many users on their platform and we're talking about each one of these products is about a $5000 price tag per month. So, very attractive pricing for us and our partner at Refinitiv. It's really a growth story. So it's really can't help you model it. As users come onto the platform and select our products and they can select all or several different versions of our product. But we're pretty excited about the partnership and the efforts already. Again, it's just launched April 15, which was in our announcement and Refinitiv is known for their presence in OTC data. So, many of the clients that they are already distributing to use them for access to their over-the-counter market data subscription plan.
Hugh Miller: Great color there. Appreciate that. And just I guess the follow up being on; I know you guys had previously indicated the deal on migration that would impact distribution fees from 1Q. Just wanted to double check and should we just be assuming kind of distribution fees being relatively unchanged, or do you see anything kind of line of sight to any deal on migration adjustments which you should consider in the coming quarters?
Rick McVey: Sure. Just taking one step back, if we do give dealers in a couple of plans we give them a choice of a distribution fee plan or plan it's all variable. And then, in most products, if a dealer is on a variable plan there is a minimum monthly fee commitment. So, just as a reminder and we're always cautious about giving guidance on distribution fees because we give dealers the choice, so we give them multiple options. And the other point is, these unused minimum fees they can vary period-to-period depending on activity and you saw that in the first quarter where in particular for under our Eurobond plan where volumes were up 45% sequentially. You saw the unused minimum fees go down. Great news for us. We would like unused minimum fees to be zero. You have specific question on what are the expectations going forward. There's some minor changes that we're tracking right now in commitments, but if you looked at Q2 where we have more complete visibility where we're expecting Q2 to look a lot like Q1 in the aggregate.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys. Good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Shutler: Could you talk about the move of certain ETF market makers recently going from open trading to a disclosed protocol and how do you think about the impact on your business over the long-term and maybe more specifically does it increase any risk of investors being willing to trade on other venues with that market maker?
Rick McVey: Sure. Yes, listen. I think this is great news right. When you think about what that represents in terms of new liquidity and new entrants in the credit markets to benefit the overall market and investors in particular that's just a great outcome from open trading. We've had a highly sophisticated market maker that was not really able to make markets in credit and tell open trading really took off here, started with anonymous trading and has been -- become so relevant to clients that they've made a business decision that they would like to start going to clients as a direct counterparty and trading on a disclosed basis. That's a great outcome for the market around what also is bringing to overall market liquidity. With respect to -- our view is that look -- the market makers are going to be where the investor orders are. And we are highly confident that when it comes to institutional credit trading we've had a big lead on the industrial orders and that lead is growing and we are working with all of our market makers to make sure that they have the technology and the pricing models that they need to scale and grow their business with us and we feel very good about that position today.
Tony DeLise: And Rick I would just add that really this transition reflects two important milestones; one is, the power of the network that has been built here at MarketAxess, the client network is truly global, it includes international clients, international asset managers of all sizes and the value of that for a market maker to go out and connect to each one individually is a near to impossible. And they really need someone to aggregate and connect that client electronically, and then, the demand for price as well and organize it in such a way that sufficient for the end client. So, I think that's reflective of the network that has been built here over many years. It's also very powerful for the next market maker in open trading. We are seeing higher demand from what I will call new proprietary market makers coming into open trading because they see the value and the opportunity that is presented by open trading and will further drive the growth of open trading with more unique liquidity not less. So it's a great outcome for really all parties, the new market maker getting access to close to 1500 clients instantaneously. For us the power of our network, and then, obviously the liquidity that's now being enhanced in open trading as well.
Chris Shutler: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, separately, if we look at the different TRACE buckets, would you mind just giving us kind of the updated market share that you believe that you have in each of those buckets? Thanks a lot.
Tony DeLise: So Chris you're asking, I'm assuming you're asking about U.S. high-grade as opposed to asking about by product.
Chris Shutler: That's right, Tony.
Tony DeLise: Yes. So you just one thing in terms of a little bit of color. We continue to believe where we do best and we do best which is in non-blocks, 5 million and under, first quarter even though overall market share was down. First quarter we did post to help the increase in non-block market share year-over-year. And on the flip side, and this is more reflective of market conditions year-over-year where we did not perform as well as in block trades. Now, if you go back a year ago and you think about what happened in the marketplace there was a lot of central bank activity and positioning there was a tremendous amount of trading in large blocks of short dated selling programs where we did very well. And that just -- did not repeat itself and that's why market share there's lots of factors that go into market share and around the market conditions and the type of flow in the market. And it just did not repeat itself. So on the block side, on a flip side blocked trading block market share was down year-over-year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein: Thanks guys. Good morning. A question around another one around open trading. So as the platform continues to grow in scale, can you guys just remind us around your thoughts on self clearing how much would it cost you guys to go down that route how big the platform needs to ultimately get to offer you to potentially switch?
Rick McVey: Alex, great question. We look at the success of open trading and remember, open trading is a global product. So it's across cleared products cross clearinghouses, so the solutions depend on the jurisdiction, but growing our efficiency on how we clear and how we -- more importantly how we control the client experience is very important to us. So we continue to look at that. We continue to look at ways to have more efficient clearing both in Europe and in the U.S. and the numbers that we're putting up in open trading make the economics of self clearing quite compelling at this point in time. And just they will grow over time as open trading grows over time.
Alex Blostein: Got you. And then, the second question a little more macro related, but so, Tony, I heard you talk obviously about the spreads and kind of how that impacts capture rates but as you think about the yield curve dynamic that we've been in and the forward potential with lower rates. How does that typically impact your guys as market share and capture rates to maybe just a reminder there would be helpful on a kind of go forward basis, if the curve stays where it is.
Tony DeLise: Yes. So two things there. And you're right to pick on you know pick on the two items which is more market share and capture rates. If we got to an environment where you know where yields are rising here, or we have a flattening of the yield curve. We've seen with the flattening of the yield curve, we have seen the year to maturity come in. So that means duration for us is a little bit lower. But, when you look over the past five quarters now that's one factor the past five quarters are U.S. high-grade fee per million has not moved. So there are other factors that influence it. If the yield curve you know continues to flatten you could see some further decline in years to maturity. On the flip side, on the market share piece of it, we do better across all trades sizes. We do better when -- with shorter dated paper and if with a rising yield environment or a flattening of the yield curve, clients are tending to trade shorter dated paper. Our market share is typically higher. So, all things being equal if yields go up across the curve, you probably see some dampening in our in our fee per million again lots of things go into that equation. But you probably see market share go up as well.
Alex Blostein: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.
Chris Allen: Good morning guys. A couple of follow ups. I guess, one just on the international business. I'm just kind of curious the growth in international clients, the busy share gains you're seeing, the volumes you're seeing, they've been driven by new clients coming on or increased business from existing clients. And what do you guys think your penetration wise in terms of the international client base.
Tony DeLise: I'm not sure we have the specific numbers on contribution, but it's obviously a little bit of both. We're really pleased with on-boarding more clients not just in Europe, but in Latin America and Asia as well that are helping us to drive the international numbers to new highs. But as you would expect Chris, the lion's share of the secondary volume still comes from the largest asset managers and we are definitely turning some of those in our favor that have been active on other platforms in the past and continue to do more on the MarketAxess system and are clearly benefiting from the broader liquidity model that we have.
Chris Concannon: Yes. And Chris I would add that some of that growth is being driven by the diversity of liquidity that is on the platform. The EM local markets you need local dealers and we've been adding those local dealers to our platform across the international market. That's key to some of the liquidity that's being accessed by the some of the global institutional investors on the platform. So it is important that you just can't have a valuable network with the largest dealers you have to have a diversity of dealers to grow across all these international products.
Chris Allen: Thanks. And then, just a quick one just on market data. Refinitiv agreement, how many incremental uses that open your data up to, and then what are the next set of opportunities for market data moving forward. Thanks.
Rick McVey: We have the highly specialized institutional client trading base on our platform, but there are lots of interested parties in quality real-time credit data around the world for other purposes. And that's really the additive distribution that we expect to see from Refinitiv. And in one of the conversations that I had with them, when we were contemplating this partnership, their distribution network is massive right. There are 200,000 or 300,000 data clients and we are a small fraction of that in terms of the trading community. And they're truly global. And so some things like what we're able to offer an EM broad application around the world in places we just can't reach on our own. So we think this partnership makes great sense for both Refinitiv and for MarketAxess.
Chris Allen: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back to Rick McVey for his final remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you very much for joining us today and I like to celebrate National Admin Day for all of you out there. We couldn't survive without you. So thanks for your dedicated support to all of us and enjoy the rest of your day. We look forward to catching up with everyone next quarter.
Operator: And with that ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's program. This concludes the conference. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, January 30, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to David Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MaretAxess. Please go ahead.
David Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess' fourth quarter 2018 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Chris Concannon, President and COO also joins us for the call today and we’ll make some brief remarks. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended, December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter 2018 results. This morning we reported strong fourth quarter results, driven by record market share across our core products and record Open Trading activity. Overall trading volume of $442 billion was up 24% compared to Q4 2017. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share reached a record of 19.3%, up from 17.6% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows especially strong growth and reached a record of 10.9%, up from 6.3% in the same period last year. Open Trading had a record quarter with a volume of $118 billion, up 96% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenue of $112 million was up 14% compared to Q4 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $54 million, and diluted EPS was up 38% to $1.21. According to Greenwich Associates' Institutional Investors Survey published in the fourth quarter, MarketAxess maintained its leading position in U.S. credit electronic trading with an estimated 85% market share. Before we move into further review of our results, I am pleased to share two exciting new developments. Chris Concannon joined MarketAxess last week as our President and Chief Operating Officer on the same day we moved into our new corporate headquarters in Hudson Yards. We believe that Chris brings a unique set of skills to the company, and he will join us later in the call today. Slide 4 highlights our full-year results and continued strong growth rates. 2018 marks the 10th consecutive year of record trading volume, revenue, and operating income. Full-year 2018 revenue with a record $436 million, up 10.7% from 2017 and diluted EPS was a record $4.57 up 17.5%. Commission revenue for 2018 was up 10% year-over-year to a record $391 million as overall trading volumes reached a record $1.7 trillion up 17.5%. Estimated U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield market share both reached records as we experience strong volume growth across core products. These gains in market share were driven in part by the growing number of client firms active on the platform. In 2018, more than 15,000 institutions were active on the system with 850 firms trading three or more products. Finally, our 2018 results continue to show attractive long-term growth with five-year compound growth rates of 13% for revenue and 20% for EPS, creating superior returns for market access shareholders. Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. Fourth quarter market conditions were favorable for our business. Credit spreads widened and credit spread volatility increased. New issue activity was lighter than normal and investment managers experienced outflows. Secondary liquidity was challenging and dealers and investors both relied on MarketAxess for a higher percentage of their trading needs. Our expanded liquidity pool with open trading is especially valuable in this kind of environment. We have seen a stark reversal of market conditions in January, as investor sentiment has moved back to risk-on. The new issued calendar is active, fund flows are positive, order flow has shifted predominately to offer-wanted, and both high grade and high yield credit spreads have tightened significantly. In this environment, average daily trading volumes on market access month-to-date are still higher than both Q1 and Q4 2018 levels, but high grade and high yield market share is significantly below Q4. Slide 6 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading experienced an exceptionally strong fourth quarter. Adoption accelerated during the quarter with volumes up 96% to a record level of $118 billion. Average daily open trading volume surged to $1.9 billion and average daily open trade count was 5,600 trades. Open Trading represented 27% of our volume in Q4, up from 175 last year. Over 344,000 open trading transactions were completed in the fourth quarter, up from 168,000 in Q4 2017. Open Trading liquidity providers or price makers on the platform drove approximately 1.7 million price responses, representing a 1285 increase in activity in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, approximately 790 firms provided prices through open trading. This significant increase in client and dealer trading activity translated into increased transaction cost savings for market participants. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $57 million in transaction costs through Open Trading on the system, up 175% from the fourth quarter last year. Participants benefited from the average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.5 basis point in yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. On annualized basis, Open Trading liquidity takers saved $163 million, an 82% increase from 2017. Open trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace Open Trading as an important source of new liquidity. Slide 7 provides an update on our international progress. Our ongoing investment in international expansion continues to show returns with international client volume of 20% to $456 billion in 2018. Growth over the longer term has remained strong with a compound five-year annual growth rate of 45% in international client volumes. The increase in volumes in 2018 was driven by the more than 740 active international client firms trading on the system. Our emerging market product continues to perform well with five-year compound growth in trading volume of 32%. We are seeing especially good results in the 26 EM local markets available for trading with five-year compound growth over 100%. Eurobond volumes were up 31% for the year which we believe is driven by healthy market share gains. Our preparations for all Brexit scenarios are on track and our new office in the Netherlands is staffed and up and running. We are pleased with our progress internationally and continue to invest in the significant growth opportunity outside of the United States. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were up 20% year-over-year to $241 billion for the quarter due to a 1.7-percentage-point increase in estimated market share coupled with a 9% increase in estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes. In spite of weak market volumes, our other credit category trading volumes were up 32% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across the emerging markets, U.S. high yield, and European corporate bonds were down around 10% in the aggregate. The standout this quarter was high-yield bonds where higher volatility in spreads and loan new issuance resulted in an estimated 4.5-percentage-point increase in market share and a 66% increase in trading volume. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 14% year-over-year. The 24% increase in trading volume resulted in a 15% uplift in commissions. Information services revenue was up 4% on a quarterly basis and 9% on a full-year basis. Post-trade services revenue was up 6% on a quarterly basis and 38% on a full-year basis. The step function increase in post-trade services revenue in 2018 was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and new customers. In 2019, we expect information services and post-trade services revenue will grow in the low-double digits. Expenses were up 18% year-over-year and operating income was up 11% year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices operating income was up 15%. The effective tax rate was 18.3% for the fourth quarter and 20.7% for full year 2018. During the quarter, we recognized $1.9 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Our diluted EPS was $1.21 on a stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 17% year-over-year as the 24% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture. On a year-over-year basis, lower duration resulted reduction in our U.S. high-grade fee capture, and revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted in early 2018 resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture. That said, we're seeing little movement in our U.S. high-grade fee per million over the past four quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in each trade-sized bucket. Our other credit category fee per million increased by $10 on a sequential basis. A higher percentage of volume in the other credit category was derived from high yield in the fourth quarter driven by 31% sequential growth and high-yield trading volume. There was little change in the fee capture at the individual product level during the quarter. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Compensation and benefits costs accounted for the most half of the $3.4 million sequential uplift in expenses. An increase in the variable incentive accrual which is tied directly to operating performance and the impact of additional headcount and higher share based compensation drove the growth in compensation and benefits costs. We experienced sequential increases in several other expense categories. Most notably, higher clearing cost was due to the 33% sequential increase in Open Trading volume, higher trade show and promotions drove marketing expense up and higher general and administrative costs was largely due to a successful emerging markets charity day donation. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of December 31st were $486 million and free cash flow reached $175 million in 2018. Dividend and share repurchases aggregated $95 million. Capital expenditures in 2018 were $48 million and include $25 million related to the build-out of our new Hudson Yards office space. Our recurring quarterly dividend is an important element of our capital management strategy. With the announced 21% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.51 per share, we have doubled the dividend level in the past three years. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 30,000 shares under our share buyback program. Our board authorized the new $100 million share repurchase program to replace the plan expiring at the end of March. As it’s been our practice, the principal purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset dilution from employee equity grants. On Slide 13, we have our 2019 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures, and the effective tax rate. We expect the total 2019 expenses will be in the range of $224 million to $256 million. The midpoint in that range suggests an approximate 12% year-over-year increase in expenses which will be similar to our growth rate over the past three years. 2019 capital expenditures are expected to range from $25 million to $30 million of which roughly half relates to software development costs. We expect that the effective tax rate of full year 2019 will range from 20.5% to 22.5%. The guidance range incorporates an estimate for excess tax benefits related to share awards of approximately $6 million which would be similar the amount recognized in 2018. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the strong market share gains in the fourth quarter and for the full year in our core products. Open Trading growth is accelerating and rapidly becoming an essential pool of liquidity for investors and dealer clients. Business expansion is on track internationally and we are investing for the future. Now, I am happy to introduce Chris Concannon who will make some brief remarks about the opportunity he sees ahead for market access.
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Rick. It's great to be here and it's great to be part of this amazing team that you’ve dealt. I’m very excited about the opportunity. While it is only day 7 on the job, I’d like to share some exciting early observations about the company and the opportunity ahead. First, I’m pleased to say that I’ve finally graduated from the minor leagues of equities to the major league called fixed income, the largest asset class on the planet. MarketAxess sits in the middle of this giant market. And that market is in the early stages of a transformation to electronic trading. MarketAxess is the clear leader in that space and it is still early days of a multi-year transformation. Second, Rick mentioned the client cost savings on the company’s Open Trading platform. That execution quality that MarketAxess is delivering is an opportunity to drive more business to the company’s platform as clients become more educated about the superior execution quality. The prices that clients are achieving are setting the standard for best execution in the fixed income market. Finally, I am very excited about the market data opportunity that the company has. Both our real-time pricing information and our historical pricing information is a gold source of execution quality in a corporate bond market, and provides us with a wonderful revenue opportunity. So Rick thanks for letting me join the impressive team, and I think we’re ready to take Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Rich Repetto: So I guess the first question is on Open Trading. Great increase the 27% of the market, and I know Chris has capabilities and knowledge in this - in the sort of the market that's more liquid and faster trading. So, I guess the question is how do you plan to grow - you’ve been growing systematically, what drove, besides I guess volatility, you’re up to the 27%? And then what new things do you have Rick and Chris in mind to go grow further in 2019?
Chris Concannon: Thanks, Rich. I'll start on that one. It was a great quarter. And as you know, liquidity was challenging in credit markets throughout the quarter, which is one of the reasons that our clients were leaning on MarketAxess and Open Trading was more valuable than ever. Part of it is just client trading behavior and adoption, and this is especially the case for investment managers. It's pretty easy for them to include MarketAxess, Open Trading in their inquiries and take advantage of the system as a liquidity taker. The bigger challenge, but also the bigger opportunity, is to see more of them move toward the liquidity provider side. And that is a big change in the trading process that involves changes to their order management and compliance systems and utilizing data engines in real time. But we are seeing this - starting to see a movement in that direction. And in my opinion, that will be one of the bigger opportunities in the years ahead. The other piece that we’re seeing is that, by opening up the market in credit, we are enabling new competitors to enter this space and commit capital for market making. So, liquidity pool is in fact growing and quarter in and quarter out we’re not only seeing new entrants the ones that are coming in continue to do more business. So that liquidity pool continues to get larger and as a result the competitiveness of open trading continues to improve. We will continue to invest as well, as you point out, in new training protocols. We continue to benefit from leveraging RFQ trading so far. But we think that there are opportunities to participate in other parts of the market to trade with faster protocols. So, this is one of the many reasons that we're pleased that Chris is here is that he has seen so many different protocols and knows the pros and cons of all of them during his many years of experience in the equity and foreign exchange markets. And it sure feels like fixed income is starting to move in the same direction and you will see investment in new protocols as part of the open trading strategy as well.
Rick McVey: And, Rich, I’ll just add. As you know, the managed fund industry is certainly very focused on cost and it's not only cost of their own infrastructure but it’s cost of trading and trading cost generally. And when you look at the statistics that we shared today on savings that was delivered by the open trading platform that's a pretty attractive enhancement to returns and much reduced trading costs for the average managed fund. So, I think certainly the open trading platform is finding a lot of new clients as well as what I'll call same-store sales with current clients given the cost savings that they're experiencing.
Rich Repetto: And I would assume, Rich, that the additional liquidity provided you're talking about more will be like I'd say liquidly providers you’re talking about are more be like I’d say it will be electronic liquidity providers, market makers. Is that fair?
Rick McVey: Yes. There's I think that there are three pockets of liquidity. Well, I know there are three buckets of liquidity under the hood of open trading. One is the alternative market makers who are experienced with electronic market making and other asset classes and a subset of those from ETF arbitrage strategies that are now in place in credit. The second is extending the dealer community available to investors on their electronic order flow and the third is buy side asset managers that are able to take advantage of matching opportunities.
Rich Repetto: And I guess just one last follow up would be on expenses and to Tony. And given the range up – I think it’s 9% of 15% I believe is the full range. But if you sort of look at that midpoint and I know you had to pay the signing bonus here for the free agent. But even taking that into account you also had some decrease expenses for the duplicate rent and I guess what I'm saying it seems like where we expected it to a little bit to offset, maybe a little bit increase. But are you investing or expanding the investment at any other initiatives I guess is the question?
Rick McVey: And Rich - we continue to invest here and we’ve – you heard from Rick a little bit here on changes and enhancements. And we have demands from clients around technology and automation. We continue to expand our geographic reach and we’re expanding our addressable market. We’re supporting new protocols, we’re addressing a Brexit and other regulatory changes. And we’re also investing in senior management and Chris is an example of that sitting here. I mean of course I’m trying to slice and dice the expense increase here but and this isn't to be isn’t to be self-serving but to just help you know bridge the difference. If you look at Chris coming on board, there are other - we had a long-term employment agreement for Rick they were both AKs so it’s both public knowledge. There's other senior management investments we think the time is right and we're at we're at an inflection point but if you just look at the investment just humor me look at the investment in it the senior managers, it's somewhere in the $8 million to $9 million range, and if you just carve that out, you're looking at an expense increase below 10%. So I don't think it should be a surprise given those investments particularly in senior management, but we're also investing you know we are investing for the future, so we a big part of that investment as around headcount it’s across the board, there's a big investment in technology resources anticipated. So you know we're not shy about the expense increase and again we think the time is right to continue on that investing path.
Chris Concannon: And I just to add to that. We've mentioned in prior calls but the demand for automation and credit trading has never been higher. So what we are seeing is that investor clients that are trying to reduce trading and transaction costs are increasingly moving toward automation and auto execution especially for the smaller trade sizes and dealers as we know have been trending toward algo market-making for a greater percentage of their credit trading. So, we're responding to those demands and we are highly confident that the long-term returns on those investments are going to be very attractive for our shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen from Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Chris Allen: Good morning, guys. Just want to talk a little bit about the environment. I mean, you guys know that January volumes since you weigh up, market share kind of came in. Maybe the issuance levels were basically nonexistence for most of the month. Is this kind of a function of people just kind of prepaying for issuance until the market is kind of came back or just any color on that would be helpful?
Rick McVey: Sure. New issuance is actually been pretty decent this month. It’s not at last January’s levels, but the capital markets have been open and the inflows have been helping to support new issues at tighter spreads. But similar to the equity markets, if you really look at the trend in credit spreads, there was consistent widening going on for four months toward the end of 2018. And literally in three weeks, we reversed half of that move. So this went completely the opposite direction with respect to risk on. And in addition to new issues being far higher than they were certainly in December, you do see asset managers that have seen significant inflows, we hear anecdotally that many of those inflows are coming from international sources including Asia. So there is intermediation of those flows that we are often times don’t see. And there also have been an increase in story bonds that have been a big part of TRACE where there’s high volatility in issuers like Pacific Gas that we’ve seen through the months. So I think the core flow business that where we excel continues to perform very well in January, and we have some ideas on how to participate more fully in other pockets of activity. But I think probably the right way to look at this is if you took the average of our December and January market share, you'd probably get a truer reflection of the long-term trends because December and January are both unusual months in terms of the flows that are reported into TRACE.
Chris Allen: And then just one more for me, just distribution fee, have you seen any changes in kind of - I mean, people shifting in terms of pricing plans? Kind of what's the outlook there moving forward? Anything on the horizon? How should we be thinking about it through 2019?
Tony DeLise: Chris, I wish I could tell you with complete clarity. We give dealers the choice of plans, and some have a distribution fee, some are all variable or have an execution fee. So, it's tough to predict. I'll tell you, just looking at the fourth quarter, when you look at that small change for U.S. high grade in particular, we did have one dealer migrate to the distribution fee plan in the fourth quarter. So, that gave rise to about a $400,000 increase in distribution fees. I'm cautious about giving the – put forward guidance just because it's difficult to predict. Even things like unused minimum fees, it depends on activity and activity for those individual dealers. So, it can bubble around month-to-month. I'll give you one thing, though, just in terms of what we have clarity on today. We do have one dealer in the first quarter, one dealer effective January 1st, that is moving from the high-grade distribution fee down to the all variable fee. So, all things being equal, lots of things in the mix, but all things being equal, that one dealer migrating would cause a reduction in distribution fees of about $0.5 million in the first quarter. But I do caution. There's a lot of moving pieces in the – even the distribution fees.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Rick, maybe you can start just with the hire of Chris. Obviously, it was a big hire for MarketAxess. It deepens your senior leadership team significantly. In terms of the company’s and the board's motivation to go out and make this hire just wondering if you could speak to two things. One, Chris have extensive experience in M&A in integrating large businesses at Bats and Cboe, was that experience viewed as valuable and a necessary addition to the experience you already have within your leadership team? And then secondarily, I know you signed an employment contract through 2025, Rick. But can you speak a bit to about whether succession planning by the board was also a key consideration in the hire?
Rick McVey: Sure. No. I'm happy to talk about both of those. And just…
Chris Concannon: Are you sure you don't want me to answer?
Rick McVey: …on the first question on M&A, of course, that was one of the many skills that Chris has that that I, in particular, was attracted to. We have built the company as you know almost entirely through organic growth. And we're in a great position to think both about the next wave of organic growth but also be able to be opportunistic about M&A opportunities. And Chris has been very successful with various M&A strategies in a variety of different companies that he's worked for in the past and we're excited to have him lead our corporate development effort. I would say though it doesn't address either of the two questions that you asked but equally important is the skill set around trading automation that Chris brings to the company that are clearly showing real traction now in credit. So, it is really just in the last two years that dealers have moved to algo trading, high frequency trading firms have shown up in credit. Investors are moving to auto execution so the litany of experiences and knowledge of trading protocols that Chris has, we think is ideally timed for the changes that are taking place in credit. And we couldn't be any more pleased to have those skills around the table as well. And of course, we are now a much larger company than we were four or five years ago and the board has responsibilities at all levels of the management team around succession planning. So that was also one of the key things that that we were seeking to accomplish with bringing Chris on board. So from my perspective, he checked a lot of boxes and we’re really excited to have him here working both with the management team and the board.
Kyle Voigt: Second question is really some on the growth in high-yield in the quarter is exceptional and we can see that Open Trading was nearly half the volume there. I know ETF market makers are very active in that market and their activity can really depend on the flows and volume and some fixed income ETFs and funds. Just wondering if you can comment on how much of your high-yield volume this ETF market makers drove in the fourth quarter versus a more normalized quarter? And I'm really just trying to understand whether we're seeing similarly strong growth from your core institutional clients in that market as well.
Tony DeLise: So it’s Tony here. On the ETF side, you’re exactly right, they are important components who are high yield trading. And while the fourth quarter, the percentage of volume represented by the ETF community was up it was not up appreciably. And what that tells you is that we had growth from traditional long-only clients and from the ETF community. And just to put in perspective it was around 30% of the high yield volume. But I would tell you at other points in time in the past that percentage for example when energy blew up back in the fourth quarter of 2015 that percentage was closer to 40%. It's been bubbling in the around 25% or so. So not an appreciable change growth across all clients.
Kyle Voigt: Last one for me is really just around – similarly you touched on earlier maybe streaming price protocols. Rick, I think you maybe alluded to this but is that going to be a significant area of investment when you talk about investing in new protocols. I know that's probably a wide array of things but is that a key component of that? And I'm wondering where you see the opportunity for streaming price protocols to become more frequently used? Is there subset of more liquid bonds or is the opportunity a lot larger than that?
Rick McVey: Yes. I would point to two things and, yes, it is one piece of a much broader strategy. And an important part of the investment budget that Tony talked about earlier is technology developers and greater output in terms of new protocols available for our clients. But there are two places where I think faster protocols including streaming protocols make a lot of sense. One is on newly issued bonds. And as you know we don't participate all that actively on the first week or so of trading following new issues and we do think that there are ways for us to participate more fully through quicker protocols than streaming prices. The second is really in the retail space, and we do think we have an opportunity to invest organically in retail and private client business and have a bigger impact in that client segment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So, I was hoping that you could elaborate a bit more on that market data opportunity that Chris spoke to in his prepared remarks. Historically, you've used your data as a means to attract order flow and hopefully increase transaction revenues. Is that philosophy going to change going forward?
Chris Concannon: Patrick, it’s Chris. That's correct. I'll take that. No. There has to be a healthy balance between attracting new clients and new business and not overcharging for that entry or charging too much of an entry fee, but there is really a wealth of data within the current platform. And if you look at the growth of Open Trading, the data on debt and liquidity, which is a key factor in the cost of trading a fixed income instrument so that the more we can distribute that data, the more we can – it's not just a price increase game. It's also a distribution and being smart around the data that we are sharing or haven't shared just yet. So, I think the opportunities both in the form of new products as well as in fees that are smart but don't damage the growth of the product.
Rick McVey: And then one thing I would add, Patrick, is that when we look at our peers that have more developed data businesses, oftentimes they are doing that in partnership with the large data companies Often times they are doing that in partnership with a large data companies for distribution. And that is something that we really have not done much of in the past, but we are going to test some new distribution channels in the New Year. We’re optimistic that that will also help them in creating better traction in data revenue.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then I guess speaking of initiatives that Chris is going to be tasked with. So regarding M&A, how broad of a net would you guys think of capping here? And what types of deals do you think might hit your radar going forward?
Rick McVey: The big picture here is that nothing has changed in our enthusiasm for the global credit opportunity. It’s an enormous market and we think we have unique competitive advantages. So our focus is squarely on continuing to deliver returns in that very, very large market opportunity. It doesn’t mean that we wouldn’t look at alternative asset classes including other areas of fixed income, but our focus today continues to be on credit. And I think what we said in the past is still true today. We are interested in product capabilities that would extend our offering to our institutional clients whether it be data offerings, trading offerings or post rate. And we think there could be interesting opportunities in all three of those. So nothing specific to comment on today, but we’re excited to have Chris here to really ramp up our thoughts and our creativity around corporate development.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And maybe one last quick one for me for Tony. So you kind of gave the commentary around what ADV was compared to previous periods and talked about market share, can we actually get the month-to-date ADV that you guys have seen across new products?
Chris Concannon: Is it on January, Patrick?
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yes.
Chris Concannon: We've got two more days left here. And Rick gave some comments in the prepared remarks where ADV’s running ahead of both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of last year. So be a little patient, but we'll have the numbers out on Monday.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Campbell: I think you mentioned that that broader kind of liquidity taker option in the more volatile markets during the fourth quarter is part of the uptake in open trading usage. Historically, do those clients tend to stick with open trading after your volatility maybe dies down a little bit or do they kind of back off of that at some point?
Chris Concannon: Well, we've seen nothing but them sticking with open trading and increasing their activity. So, sequentially, we've had a pretty consistent track record of seeing open trading adoption virtually every quarter. And as you know in a quarter like last quarter where the price improvement percentages were growing for liquidity takers and the level of price improvement on average per trade was higher it's a powerful reinforcement of the benefits of having orders into the MarketAxess system. So, we are seeing a continuation of that trend in January even though the market conditions are very different. But as I mentioned our view is that open trading was especially valuable in the fourth quarter during challenging liquidity times.
Jeremy Campbell: And then, Chris, congrats on the new role from us equity analyst still toiling there in the minor leagues but I know I know it’s super early days here but Rick and Tony, I mean is there any kind of current initiatives that MarketAxess has had going on but you think, Chris can really kind of accelerate across the goal line in 2019 and then Chris, I know day seven here but you listed a kind of bunch of areas of focus here but is there what would be the top of your hit list as far as kind of rolling up your sleeves here at MarketAxess?
Chris Concannon: Well, we just talked about Open Trading and that opportunity is just a phenomenal opportunity as I think about the buy side experiencing a transformation of electronic trading and what has been a you know a largely much more manual market, they need a lot of assistance from the market that's forming price. So when we think about order types and enhancements to the trade platform, I think that's an important area that I can help. I've seen transformations in both the foreign exchange market as well as the equity market and there's things that the end user needs that helps them execute their trading activity and to follow on to Rick’s point on Open Trading, I just think you know when these clients experience the Open Trading execution quality, they continue to come back. So it's kind of like eating a Chick-fil-A, once you had one you keep adding more and more to your diet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Blostein: A question around distribution plan especially at high yield. So I know you guys made some changes last year with a handful of dealers moving over. But is that part of your liquidity pool continues to growth and it sounds like participation from ETF market makers has also been a meaningful contribution. How should we think about more of the participants switching to the distribution plan over time within high yield?
Rick McVey: We haven't had from when we adopted that new plan, August 1st of last year, August 1st of 2017. We haven’t had any migrations. You’ve seen more of that in the high grade plan. So we’re not tracking anything right now. Those dealers do enjoy seeing the disclosed order flow. Even with the increase in Open Trading percentage, the disclosed dealers are also increasing their participation on the platform. So, again, we're not tracking anything there and unlike on high grade where it does tend to swing around a little bit.
Alex Blostein: And then I heard your comments obviously around expense for 2018 with some incremental uplift here as well. But I guess bigger picture when we take a step back, how are you guys thinking about the tradeoff between growth and expenses versus market share gains and maybe just a little bit of a near to medium-term outlook on expense growth?
Rick McVey: We're going to continue to invest out. And we oftentimes do talk about operating margins and where margins are running. I look at over the past four years now margins have been hovering around 50% and yet at the same time we've been investing heavily and again to expand the addressable market and add new protocols and address Brexit. And now with the senior management hires, it's– we would do anything we could to increase market share. And our view around the table is now’s the time to invest, and if that means that margins, at least in the near term, if margins are kind of flat-lined at 50%, that's not a terrible outcome. It's tough to look out. If we had a crystal ball, even that it's tough to look out beyond the next year or so, I think there is leverage in the margin, in the business. I think it's more about growing the top line. It's more about growing market share, adding new products, monetizing more on the data side. That's where we'll see the leverage come through, and market conditions are supportive, and Open Trading is a bigger piece of what we're doing. That’s where we’ll see the margin expansion coming through.
Chris Concannon: And, Alex, it’s Chris. I’ll just mention, all of our new hires are expected to grow top line.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugh Miller from Buckingham. Please go ahead.
Hugh Miller: Just have a question. You guys obviously have historically from quite a deal of trading seen a difference between the spread widening versus tightening scenarios in terms of the hit rate. I was wondering, as we think about growth in Open Trading, does that play a factor in that type of scenario with client-to-client trading in terms of the hit rate for buying versus selling or is that still similar to what we've seen in client-to-trade trading?
Rick McVey: Hugh, I can't say there's been a big change in overall hit rates, whether it's on the offer side or the bid wanted side. You know we have this the dynamics. We typically the hit rate is higher on the bid wanted side versus the offer wanted side. That trend or that difference has continued to play through. So, of course, the more price responses that we get in, the better chance of getting a trade executed, the more value we’re delivering, drives more order flow on the platform. That’s the model. But I can’t say looking over the past several years, you’ve seen an appreciable change in that hit rates whether on the bid side or the offer side.
Hugh Miller: And then just in terms of the opportunities in 2019, can you talk a little bit about dealer to dealer trading, what you’re seeing on the platform in terms of adoption and how you see that as a channel for growth in 2019?
Rick McVey: Sure. I’ll take that one Hugh. But fourth quarter was interesting because the level of spread widening I think caught the market by surprise during the quarter. And there was a fair amount of interest in reducing credit risk by investors and dealers. So we did see a nice uptick in dealer-initiated Open Trading order flow. And I think what you’re starting to see is that this is becoming a very attractive liquidity pool for the dealer community. And the breadth of liquidity that we have both investors and other dealers on the platform is a great alternative for dealers when they’re looking to reduce balance sheet and shed risk. So when they’ve tested the system, they’ve had good results and that has caused them to increase activity, especially in strained market environments like the one that we had in the fourth quarter.
Hugh Miller: Do you have a sense as to kind of what percentages of the overall trading that would represent in Q4 or historically?
Tony DeLise: Yes. So if you looked at pure D2D in the fourth quarter we would have stayed over 5% market share pure D2D. And, of course, what Rick is saying around the activity level and the increase in our dealer-initiated orders that’s up appreciably year-over-year.
Hugh Miller: Thank you for the color there. And I think in the prepared remarks you guys had mentioned, obviously, you gave some color in terms of the benefits from open trading from a dollar standpoint. But I think you mentioned that you're seeing roughly about a 2.5 basis point benefit in open trading for U.S. high grade relative to trades not through open trading. I was wondering is that a correct way that I have that? And as well how has that changed over time from the onset of open trading?
Tony DeLise: So yes. That's what Rick in the prepared remarks mentioned the 2.5 basis points, and just to put that into dollar terms on average every basis point in yield is somewhere around $750. It's a rough number. So 2.5 basis points you're looking at about $2,000 per million in savings. Rick didn't talk about the high yield number. That was closer to $0.28 or $2,800 per million notional trade in the fourth quarter. Across the board the fourth quarter and the reason why you saw that big jump in the savings not only were OT volumes up but the capture or the savings or the price improvement across each product was also up in the fourth quarter. And that undoubtedly had a lot to do with where spreads were going so across both high-yield and investment grade you saw spreads widening and just the delivering more cost savings in OT in that environment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Chris Shutler: So Rick, correct me if I'm wrong on this but I think you rolled Auto-Ex capabilities maybe a year ago or so. Can you just talk about the uptake so far on Auto-Ex and you know any stats or kind of trade volumes that you're doing today that are Auto-Ex or algo amongst both buy side and dealers.
Rick McVey: I don't think we have the exact stats at the ready this morning Chris but happy to follow-up with you on that but sequentially we have seen attractive growth in both a number of clients using Auto-Execution in Europe and the U.S. as well as the percentage of their trades they’re going through Auto-Ex. It's early days in credit but the trends are very clear and we'd be happy to come back to you with the exact percentage increases that we're seeing.
Chris Shutler: And then in Open Trading, I guess the percentages of Open Trading today that's buy side to buy side I know it's a pretty small percentage but any color there and trends?
Rick McVey: You know it's I wouldn't call it small, It's as there has been in past calls there are the three main pools of liquidity that are coming through Open Trading the alternative market makers, the expanded dealer community participating in orders and then the buy side. But the trends have been pretty stable in terms of buy side participation in Open Trading liquidity provision and it’s still important source that it’s running around a quarter of the volume that is done on the system.
Chris Shutler: And then lastly for Tony, the tax rate guide that was a little below expectations again. Just walk us through kind of how to think about the normalized tax rate and how much longer you'd expect to enjoy this lower tax rate?
Tony DeLise: It's a good question and the 2018 tax rate full year was just a shade under 21%. And you're right there are lots of things that go in the tax rate. There's the mix of income by jurisdiction. There's permanent items and credits and then there are these discrete items like the excess tax benefit. If we pull out the excess tax benefits from 2018, the rate would have looked more like 23.5%. And I think what we're guiding to right now if you pull out what I said again the prepared remarks around $6 million in excess tax benefit, you're going to get back to that that mid 23.5%. The second part of the question just on how long can this last. What’s the future look like for these excess tax benefits. We are sitting on around $16 million of excess tax benefits coming into 2019. Tough to tell where it's going to end up because it's depending on the stock price when options are exercised, restricted stock best. And also we don't know the timing of when the exact timing of when the options will be exercised but I'll give you in the near term 2019 and 2020what we’re tracking right now based on when restricted stock has to vest and when auctions actually expire, we’re looking at about the same number, of about $6 million this year, about $6 million next year. That could move, but that’s what we’re looking at right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Rich Repetto: I promise I'll keep this short here, but as I listen to all the questions on the Open Trading, and the one thing that occurs - it's still a request for quote even though it's sort of an automated open-to-all request for quote. And I guess the question is, and this follows on to the automated execution, someone referred to that, I know you build on the liquidity side with the electronic liquidity providers, but do you also have to get the buy side here to also buy in and move more to the automated execution if you really want to grow Open Trading volumes? I guess that would be the question.
Rick McVey: I’ll take the first crack at that, Rich. But I think that this is the first in a series of steps that the buy side is likely to take with automated means of trading and credit. And this is the most obvious where they're taking the smallest tickets with the base of real-time data that is now available to them, and they're setting parameters within which they're willing to execute the trade with no manual intervention. When you think forward, that ability to be able to price a transaction without trading intervention is a precursor to being able to be more responsive in Open Trading as a price provider. So, I think the buy-side as you well all know is under tremendous cost pressures. They're always interested in transaction cost savings that will improve portfolio returns and this is the beginning of what I think will be a multiyear investment in automated trading tools by the buy-side and ultimately those tools will make them better equipped to be responsive to matching opportunities on the system.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Just one follow-up. Just for the open trade continue to grow rapidly. I was just wondering if you give us an update on your clearing and operational plans to that part of the business? I know you’ve built out the risk management functionality to kind of support that volume growth. But are we closer today to maybe heading in a different direction from an operational standpoint just given the size and the pace of the growth there?
Rick McVey: We are benefiting from tiered pricing with our settlement partner currently. So, you're seeing the cost of settlements trend down, which is obviously a great thing for us. But we’re in early stages of reviewing our long-term settlement strategy. There are lots of scenarios that that could evolve over the next three to five years. But we've increased the level of automation that we have in our settlement process to improve the risk controls, and we're benefiting from lower pricing because of the discounts that take place at higher ticket, average daily ticket counts with earnings. So in the near term nothing specific, but we do think there are opportunities there down the road.
Operator: Our last question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Thanks for taking my last question here. Curious about your block market share in the fourth quarter and whether your fourth quarter market share gains were across both blocks and non-blocks.
Rick McVey: So on the market share side, the gains were pretty much across the board. Now, on the block side, we ended up right around 9% for the quarter. If you look over a longer term basis, over full year 2018, block share was up close to 1% close to 1 percentage point. You look at it overall, we are up a little more than 1 percentage point overall for all of the U.S. high-grade market share. So it was across the board over the span of the full year. And if you look longer term, absolutely, the trend looks similar to our market share growth overall. When you look at longer term or what happens with block trading as well. So it was pretty much across the board.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for attending today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Good day.

Analysts: Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill Kyle Voigt - KBW Chris Shutler - William Blair Chris Allen - Compass Point Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital Markets Dan Fannon - Jefferies
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results driven by increased market share across all of our core products, and continued robust Open Trading activity. Overall, trading volume of $386 billion was up 11% compared to Q3 2017. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share of 17.5% was up from 17.2% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows strong growth, and reached a record 9.2%, up from 6.9% in the same period last year. Third quarter revenue of $101 million, was up 6% compared to Q3 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $46 million, and diluted EPS was up 13% to $1.02. Expenses of $55 million were up 12%, including $1.9 million in duplicate rent expense for our new offices in Hudson yards. We expect to move in to our new headquarters by the end of the year. Open Trading adoption continues to accelerate. Additionally, emerging market and Eurobond volumes both saw rapid growth during the quarter. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions for credit trading were soft in the third quarter. Credit spreads were tighter, volatilities fell, and core product market volumes declined on average 14% from the second quarter. Overall trading conditions improved in September and into October. The combination of higher treasury yields, widening credit spreads, and elevated new issue activity has led to a much better trading environment for our business. While market trading conditions has been mixed over recent months, share gains across products have been strong, and position the company well for future growth. Slide five provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter, and was up 58% to a year record level of $88 billion. Average daily volume was $1.4 billion, also up 58%. Open Trading represented 23% of our volume in Q3, up from 16% last year. Over 282,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 155,000 in Q3, 2017. Open Trading liquidity providers or price-makers on the platform drove approximately 1.5 million price responses, representing a 107% increase in activity in the third quarter. During the quarter, over 750 firms provided prices through Open Trading, and over 1,000 firms completed at least one open trade. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $36 million in transactions costs through Open Trading on the system, up 68% from the third quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 1.9 basis points of yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. Importantly, Open Trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace this new source of liquidity. We believe the breadth and depth of our global credit liquidity solution differentiates MarketAxess from the competition. Slide six provides an update on our product and geographic diversification. Our U.S. high-yield product experienced another quarter of rapid growth. Record estimated high-yield market share of 9.2% led to a year-over-year volume increase of 27%. Our European business continued its strong performance for the year. MiFID II has had a positive impact on client trading behavior, leading to a 21% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 33% year-over-year, and EM volumes were up 32%. We are continuing our preparations for Brexit in the event there is a hard exit. We are adding senior staff to our new office in Amsterdam, and our applications with the Dutch regulator are progressing as expected. Client documentation changes are underway to avoid trading disruptions in any exit scenario. Global emerging market volume was up 22%, with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets that currently trade on the platform. We now have over 650 international client firms active on the system, representing an 18% increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Our growing footprint in international credit trading significantly expands the long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $206 billion for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year. A slight increase in estimated market share accounts for the uplift in trading volume as U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes were flat year-over-year. Year-to-date estimated U.S. high-grade market share is up one percentage point. In spite of weak market volumes, our other credit category trading volumes were up 25% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across European corporate bonds, emerging markets, and U.S. high-yield bonds were down more than 10% in the aggregate. Healthy market share gains was the main driver behind the 28% growth in Eurobond volume, 27% growth in high-yield volume, and 22% growth in emerging markets volume. With six important trading days remaining in October, estimated U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes are more than 20% ahead of third quarter levels. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share is running similar to the third quarter level, and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the third quarter level. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 6% year-over-year. The 11% increase in trading volume resulted in 5% uplift in commissions. New data contracts accounted for the $800,000 increase in information services revenue. The $800,000 increase in post-trade services revenue was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and we customers. Expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and operating income was flat year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 4%. The effective tax rate was 19.3% in the third quarter, and 21.6% year-to-date. During the quarter, we recognized $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards, and a $400,000 reduction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a provisional charge recorded in 2017. We are updating our guidance range, and now expect the effective tax rate for full-year 2018 will be between 21% and 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.02 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On slide nine, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were flat year-over-year as the 11% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture caused by several factors. First, our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017 and several high-grade dealer migrations shifted revenue from variable transaction fees to distribution fees. Distribution fees were up $4.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Second, lower years of maturity and higher yields caused a reduction in our U.S. high-grade fee capture. And third, revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted earlier this year resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture. That said, U.S. high-grade fee per million hasn't varied the past three quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially, and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in each trade size bucket. Our Other Credit category's fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis. So percentage of volume in the other credit category derived from Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yield was consistent with the second quarter, and there was little change in fee capture at the individual product levels. Slide 10, provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were flat as higher depreciation and amortization expense on infrastructure and software investments was offset by lower advertising and tradeshow spend. The year-over-year increase in expenses was 12%. Excluding the duplicate rent charge, the expense increase was 9%. Despite the soft market conditions, we continue to invest in people, technology, and infrastructure. Our full-year 2018 expenses are projected to be near the bottom end of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $7 million in duplicate rent expense. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30th were $446 million, compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the third quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $15 million, and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $6 million. We also spent $4 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12-month free cash flow is a record $178 million. Based on these results, our Board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the overall growth in estimated market share across all products during the quarter. Long-term growth priorities continue to gain momentum; including high-yield, emerging markets, and Open Trading. The increase in overall credit market volumes over the last several months provided a much better foundation for growth for our business. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning, guys.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Patrick.
Tony DeLise: Morning, Patrick.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So I think one of the key takeaways coming from your recent open market forum was I think some conversations around the challenge of having complex and large trades conducted electronically. Can you talk about some of the steps from the efforts that MarketAxess is taking to try to more aggressively go after that space?
Rick McVey: Sure. I think this is a continuation of changes that we've been making in the system to reduce concerns around information leakage. So as we've talked about in the past, Patrick, we've done quite a bit of work on allowing system participants to lead Axess in the system and identity offsetting interest in that trade, they could do so with any trade size and have the opportunity to work up trade sizes from there. We are talking to market participants about different protocols in newly issued bonds that would introduce faster means of execution for highly liquid bonds in the first period of trading. And then I think the other part to watch is the growing liquidity pool that exists in $3 million and under trade sizes and whether we will start to see a trend toward more of the large trades being broken down into smaller trade sizes.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great, thank you for that. And then maybe an expense question for Tony. I know last quarter you talked about you were tracking to add around 30 employees in the third quarter. What was the actual period-end employee count, and how does that -- you had basically flat compensation and benefits expense quarter-to-quarter, so should we think about that as maybe lower bonus accrual give what the volume environment looked like during the quarter?
Tony DeLise: Yes, so Patrick, two things in there on the headcount, and then what happened quarter-to-quarter on the comp and benefit. On the headcount, we ended up at 444 people, which was up right around 15 people from the end of the second quarter. We're sitting here today with another 15 positions where we have start days [ph] in the fourth quarter, so we do expect headcount to rise here through the end of the year, albeit we don't know what will happen with attrition, but we are sitting on 15 additional add. On the comp and benefits piece, it looks like it was just a slight increase quarter-to-quarter, but you do have an increase in salaries and benefits. It was around a $600,000 increase there. But the bonus accrual was lower. The cash bonus accrual is formulaic; it is tied to operating performance. And quarter-to-quarter that bonus accrual was down around $700,000. And you should see that's reflective of the market conditions we're referring to. So if you look at market volumes Q2 to Q3, you saw pretty healthy decline there. So not necessarily apparent when you look at that line on comp and benefits, but there were some offsetting factors in there.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All right, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Yes, good morning, Rick. Good morning, Tony.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Rich.
Rich Repetto: And congrats on the uptick in the Open Trading percentage, I guess the first question is on Open Trading. And it seems like quarter-to-quarter, I'm not looking year-over-year in there, but the quarter-to-quarter the biggest percentage increase was in high-yield. The others went up by like a percent or so, but high-yield went up more from the prior quarter, from 44% to 52%. Can you tell us like what the market dynamics that drove that big of an increase in the high-yield bucket in Open Trading?
Rick McVey: Yes, a couple of things that I'd comment on there. What we've observed in terms of Open Trading percentage by product is the less liquid markets tend to have the highest percentage of OT. And I think that that shows that Open Trading is providing the highest value in less liquid credit product areas. So that's been the case with high-yield, that we've just seen better take-up there as our technology is connecting market participants in a very important way and reduce transactions costs and in a less liquid market, like high-yield. The other thing I'd point out is we've talked with you and others, Rich, about the activity that's growing around ETF market makers in electronic trading and they're especially relevant in high-yield. So as those businesses continue to grow and embrace electronic trading you do see the impact of that in terms of not only overall volumes, but also the activity in OT.
Rich Repetto: Thanks, Rick. A follow-up on Open Trading is, I would assume the ETFs -- well, just some comments on auto ex [ph] as well, just the trend there. If Open Trading pick up I assume the auto ex and the drivers -- one of the drives is ETFs, that you would see auto ex also increasing?
Rick McVey: Yes, I would actually separate those two things. You're absolutely right at auto execution growing, but I think it's a slightly different driver there. As you all know, the buy side is laser-focused on improving trading efficiency and reducing costs. And one of the outcomes of that is that we're really seeing a new level of automation from investors in how they use the MarketAxess system. And it's gone from high-touch early on, to low-touch, and now even moving into no-touch, where the data tools that clients have are so strong that they're able to set parameters pre-trade by which they're perfection willing to auto-execute a transaction on the system. And I think I would look for this trend to grow because it does really help the buy side with an important objective around trading efficiency. It is equally relevant whether it's a disclosed trade with dealers or an open trade. It's really about do the price responses come back to meet the clients' preset expectations. And if they do they're willing to auto-execute those trades.
Rich Repetto: Got it. And the last question, Rick, is on the general environment. If you look at 3Q, and I think these are from your comments that July and August were a different story compared to September. And then you've seen, I think, even more volatility in October. And you may have covered this, but if you did I missed it. I know you covered the market share in October. But can you talk about like the fee capture trends when you have higher volatility, like September, October.
Rick McVey: Well, October, if you look at the TRACE volumes for high-grade and high-yield, very much like September. So as we approach the end of October, the September and October market volume run rate is about 22% higher than what we observed in July and August. So we did have a very soft period during the summer months. And September and October market volumes have been significantly better. The fee capture is going to depend primarily on product mix. And Tony made some comments about the success that we continue to have in the high-yield market overall. But we'll have our market volumes out at the end of October, and the product mix will drive the fee capture.
Rich Repetto: Understood. Thank you. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Kyle.
Kyle Voigt: Good morning. Just a follow-up on auto ex, but maybe more so on the Composite+ product, really just want to updated thoughts on the future of Composite+ and how this fits into the MarketAxess trading kind of ecosystem. I think maybe it could be used to help facility some of these auto ex functionalities being built into the buy side, but are there also other revenue generating opportunities for Composite+ as well?
Rick McVey: Sure, happy to take that one. No, we're really pleased to see both dealer, investor, clients embracing Composite Price Plus, which is a real-time mid-market now in about 20,000 global securities. So, incredibly valuable pre-trade price indicator, price discovery tool. And I think right now, much like our other data products; it's primarily been used as an additional tool in the trading process. There are many places I think we could go with that over time. I think it's already starting to become relevant in our TCA analytics for clients. And I think that you could even start to see it impact valuations and indices in some way as well. So a lot of effort into that, and the client take-up around Composite Price has been really encouraging. You're absolutely right, it's one of the data tools that does give clients comfort when they are utilizing auto-execution technology. So the more data that we can provide to our clients the more they can use auto execution, so it does tie in to the growing use of auto execution that we're seeing on the system as well.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then just going back to the open market forum, there were some participants that were talking streaming price protocols, and how they expect growing adoption of those protocols over time in the market. Can you help us understand what you're developing in terms of streaming price protocols and views of the adoption versus -- of streaming prices or RFQ as we are looking out maybe over the next three or five years? Thanks.
Rick McVey: Sure. I mean we have the technology capabilities to operate streaming price markets already which we do in CDS indices, and so the technology here. It's a question really of what do the streaming price quotes look like relative to what institutional investors are able to achieve through an RFQ. And to date, institutional investors have stuck with RFQ because it does create a highly competitive environment for them to achieve best execution. But as dealers get more and more sophisticated with their use of algos and those markets continue to tighten up, I do think it's possible that streaming prices especially to more liquid end of the market could offer a combination of strong liquidity and greater trading efficiency. And when the market is ready to go in that direction then we certainly are ready to go from a technology perspective.
Kyle Voigt: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Rick McVey: Hi, Chris.
Chris Shutler: I want to go back to a question earlier on high yield and just make sure I understand the dynamics here. So the high yield open trading has really accelerated in the last couple of quarters. I think it's gone up 14 percentage points in last two quarters; previously, it gone up 14 points over two years. I heard your comments on ETF, I just want to understand is are the ETF market makers what has driven the vast majority that acceleration or there are other factors?
Rick McVey: There are other factors as a key ETF market makers are an important new form of liquidity for investor clients on the platform. And it's obviously creating a better liquidity environment for our buy side clients. But it's equally relevant to see the growth in high yield trading overall and open trading adoptions specifically from one only investment managers. And a year ago, we were dealing with a very benign high yield trading environment which really kind of took the ETF market makers out of their relative value trading. The environment for high yield trading has been a lot better recently with more volatility and more movement in funds flow. So I think it's a combination of adoption by not only investment managers, greater involvement from the ETF market makers and then an improvement in the market trading conditions for high yield.
Chris Shutler: Okay, yes, make sense, Rick. And then on the some of the discussions around new functionality trend that you are kind of working on around addressing the new issue process, when should we expect to actually see you roll out that functionality and talk about kind of the discussions the consulting you are doing with the buy side trading desks as you work on those developments?
Tony DeLise: Yes, there is no set timetable like anything that we do. We are out talking to both dealer and investor clients to see if we could add value in newly issued bond trading. And I think we are at mid-stream on those conversations. And depending what we hear back in terms of new protocols around a faster, more active protocol for new issue trading, we will be ready to roll it out. So there is no set timetable, but the discussions are taking place.
Chris Shutler: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.
Chris Allen: Good morning, guys. Appreciate the commentary on the improved environment we have been seeing lately in September, October, I'm wondering if there is any commentary on how things are trending in emerging markets in Eurobonds? Obviously, Eurobonds has been a source of strength for you guys in periods and you know, it's has been a little bit flatter. And looking at September to the summer period, so any commentary there would be helpful?
Rick McVey: So Chris, you are looking for some comments on October or for the third quarter?
Chris Shutler: Yes, just in terms of I mean you kind of noted that things picked up in the back-half of September continuing into October, something like more of those comments are more focused on high grade and high yield. So just wondering how the other buckets are trending as well?
Rick McVey: You saw from the third quarter numbers that we had very good quarter in both emerging markets in Eurobonds where despite the fact that market volumes were down we had a big pickup in trading volumes. All of that came from market share gain. I think that one thing that points to -- this is more particularly for the emerging market than Eurobonds right now, market volumes are still struggling. So even we gave some commentary that October market volumes for U.S. investment grade and high yield are running 20% or more above the third quarter, that's not the case for emerging markets right now. So that one it's while healthier than the third quarter, you are not seeing that type of volume pick up. So that will be one thing that is different running into October.
Tony DeLise: On the last one, Chris, euros look based on the estimates that we can derive from tracks and others sources, euros look to be more similar to the increases that we talked about for U.S. high grade and U.S. yield.
Chris Allen: Got it, and just from an overall perspective you are seeing changes in client behavior at all? Or it's just the environment has got a little bit better and trading activities are kind of picking up? Just trying to think about this could be treated like we saw on the first quarter this year and then things starting to slow down or maybe new entrants are kind of coming and participating maybe a little bit quieter in these periods?
Rick McVey: I would separate the two but the clearly the broad based gains that we are seeing in market share reflect a change in client trading behavior. And if you look across the four core products this is shaping up to be one of our strongest years ever for market share gains overall. And what might be a little bit unusual for fact it's being driven more by EM, high yield and euros this year than it is in high grade, but even high grade up about 1% in share year-over-year. And collectively, the four products show one of the best year-over-year share gains that we have ever had. So that reflects the ongoing electronification of the credit markets and the change in trading behavior that's taking place by both dealers and investors. The second part is market environment. And we obviously can't control that. It ebbs and flows with various factors. And it hit the trough for the year in July and August and then September and October we are seeing it rebound. It looks like it's back toward more like Q2 levels. So, I would separate those two factors.
Tony DeLise: Hey, you know, jumping again on this particular point, but look these are longer term trends across all the products where we have more client engaged and trading across each product. There is open trading at the bigger piece across all of our core products. Open trading is the bigger percentage of volume. We have more clients and trading multiple products. We just ended up the third quarter where we now have more than 850 clients that are trading three or more products. That's up hundred clients just in the past year. So it's just the network and the engagement with clients across all products is just expanding.
Chris Allen: Makes sense.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeremy Campbell: Hey, thanks. So we have kind of stable pricing in high grade. And Tony, I think you mentioned duration of bonds was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter. So appreciate the update here on October volumes, but are you guys seeing duration of traded volumes in October either extend or tighten? And if we just get a kind of continuation of tightened duration, what's the outlook for pricing into the next quarter or next year?
Tony DeLise: Yes. So, Jeremy, it's obviously early in the quarter here. We aren't seeing any significant change in duration right now. We have been -- and the thing that we look at more is around years of maturity and where absolute yields are. But we are not seeing a big change in the years to maturity. The fee capture -- and this wouldn't just be investment grade but the fee capture in October at the individual product level for the core four product is very consistent with the third quarter. And as Rick, pointed before that you may see a mix of multiple products. So one product rolling faster than the other and that would influence overall fee capture, but the individual product level notes no change.
Jeremy Campbell: Got it, thanks, and then just setting back a little more big picture, I think you guys have historically kind of targeted about 150 bips of year-over-year expansion on -- in high-grade market share. I guess kind of going forward, you know, what types of shares gains should we expect from kind of blocking and tackling and executing on things under control like open trading and things like that versus some of the outside potential should the macro market dynamic improve a bit?
Tony DeLise: You know, it's a little bit of both, I think our share gains are more evident when volatility picks up. So if we are embarking on a new period of higher volatility that would be helpful to our share gains and as you know our share gains also ebb and flow with new issue activity where when new issues are extremely active there is a slice of trace that is in those newly issued bonds that we currently have a lower share of. So the new issue market has that impact, but we're playing a long game. We take a very long-term view on this and the metrics that I care about when I think about where I hope the company will be five or 10 years from now, really look very healthy to me. And Tony just outlined some of them, but if you really do the work on the share momentum broadly and not just high-grade, you will see that there is a clear trend going on, on the system with client behavior embracing more electronic trading across credit and these are very large markets. We have an incredibly strong market position and we're really pleased with what we see in terms of the share story.
Jeremy Campbell: Got it. And then one quick one; and I apologize if I missed this, but Tony, I think you kind of -- you referenced the tax rate for this year is going to be 21 to 22, any sense of what we should expect into '19?
Tony DeLise: Yes, sure Jeremy, so we hadn't completed the budget process yet for 2019, so we're not prepared at least today to give you definitive range, but that said I'll give you a little bit of color. So if you look to 2018, and you excluded windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation, the year-to-date effective tax rate would be right around 24%. That's really the jumping off point for 2019. But the difficult part is -- it's difficult sitting here today to predict those excess tax benefits because we don't know the share price for stock options, we don't know the timing of whether stock options will be exercised. I can tell you this that sitting here today, based on today's share price that in January when we have a round of restricted stock vesting, the tax benefits there would be around $2 million. So jumping off point -- and again, budget's not complete, jumping off point 24%, rolling some excess tax benefits. So, to be something less than 24%, but when we get to this January call, we'll give you more color and try and narrow down a range for you.
Jeremy Campbell: Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dan Fannon: Thanks. I guess, Tony, just building upon that -- I know the budget is not done, but maybe if you give us the framework to think about 2019 expenses. You talked about some headcount that's coming on in the fourth quarter. Is there -- if you think about the environment getting better or we looked at the summer, I guess, it doesn't -- just wondering if you're looking at spending any differently on some of the new initiatives or outlook as we think about the next 12 months.
Tony DeLise: Sure, Daniel, I study on the expenses, I mean, this is -- we are still investing for the future. We are -- you know, we're still investing in geographic expansion, launching new protocols. There's some regulatory related spend as well -- and just on the tax rate, you know, we haven't completed the process yet. And we will give you more color in January, but you know, again thinking about 2018, if you take the duplicate rent out and even we've had some impact from foreign exchange change, but if you pull those two out, the expense increase for this year is about 9% and then if you look longer term the past five years, the compound annual growth rate has also been about 9% and we're going to continue -- we had plans to continue to invest in the platform, new protocols, geographic expansion in our infrastructure. I suggest taking history into account and at least -- from modeling out sort of early models on 2019, will give more color in January, but that 9% that's where we've been and that's probably a pretty good starting point.
Dan Fannon: Got it. And then just a follow-up on the transaction fee per million and I appreciate the commentary on October and you know, the resiliency in high-grade has been consistent here in -- for the last several quarters, but I guess, as we think about a higher rate environment, is there something different that's happening that we shouldn't think about shorter duration having a negative impact on that just because of mix or is that still the right way to think of it?
Tony DeLise: Dan, if we were just isolating that one factor and realizing that years to maturity matters, trade size matters, dealer mix matters, floating rate node activity matters, but if you take those all aside and leave them constant, all we're talking about is a rising yield environment. Yes, you're likely to see some decline in fee capture and I've given some sort of color or some range in the past where for every one percentage point, change in yield across the yield curve -- you know, it could be something like $10 per million or $15 per million. So again if you're keeping everything else constant, you would see a decline in fee capture, but there are -- there's so many things that influence fee capture around, years of maturity, trade size, dealer mix. There's just a lot that goes into the mix on U.S. high-grade.
Dan Fannon: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Yes, thanks, guys, my question has been asked and answered, thank you.
Tony DeLise: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call over back to Mr. Rick McVey.
End of Q&A:
Rick McVey: Thank you very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This does conclude today's program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-25 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci – Investor Relations Manager  Rick McVey – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tony DeLise – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Kyle Voigt – KBW Rich Repetto – Sandler O'Neill Patrick O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James Chris Allen – Compass Point Chris Shutler – William Blair
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, July 25, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning. And welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2018 results. This morning we reported strong second quarter results, driven increased trading volumes, year-over-year market share gains across all four of our core products, and record open trading activity. Overall trading volume of $421 billion was up 16% year-over-year. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share of 17.4% was up from 17% last year. Second quarter revenue of $107 million was up a 11%, compared to Q2 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $52 million, up 6% from a year ago, and diluted EPS was up 7% to $1.07. Open Trading adoption continues to accelerate and reached record volume of $89 billion, up 57%. Additionally, emerging market and Eurobond volume both saw rapid growth during the quarter. Slide 4, provides an update on market conditions. Overall secondary trading additions were less favorable in the second quarter versus Q1. Credit spread volatility and interest rate volatility both declined and high-grade new issue volume was up. That combination in the short-term creates a more difficult environment for market share gains. In addition, the flattening of yield curve tends to reduce average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. This is one of the factors that negatively impacts our high-grade fee capture. Strong results during the quarter in other products helped to offset slower than normal growth in high-grade.  Slide 5, provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter and was up 57% to a record $89 billion. Open Trading represented 21% of our volume in Q2, up from 16% last year. Over 256,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the second quarter, up from 155,000 in Q2 2017. Liquidity providers were price makers on the platform, drove 802,000 price responses, representing a 45% increase in activity in the second quarter. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $38 million in transaction costs through Open Trading on the system, up 71% from the second quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately two basis points in yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. Importantly, Open Trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embraced this new source of liquidity. Slide 6 demonstrates the benefits of greater automation and credit trading. Inquiry and trade count were both up strongly in Q2, motivating market makers to continue to invest in automated tools for market making. Total trade count was up 18% year-over-year to over 800,000 transactions during the quarter. Dealer algo responses are growing rapidly, especially for auto log [ph] increase. Algo-generated price responses were up over 120% year-over-year. The growing use of algos is improving the investor client experience with average responses per inquiry reaching new highs across the system. Growing automation on the MarketAxess trading creates a highly competitive environment, including small micro-lot orders. High-grade micro-lot volume was up 23% year-over-year and estimated market share is strong at 24%. We are also seeing growing use of investor auto execution tools to lower the cost of trading on low-market impact transactions. We believe that cost benefits will continue to drive investor and dealer clients to higher levels of automation in credit trading. Slide 7 provides an update on international progress. Our international business experienced another quarter of rapid growth. MiFID II continues to have a positive impact on client training behavior, leading to a 27% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 34% year-over-year. Emerging market volume was up 27%, with strong growth in both external debt markets, as well as the 24 local EM markets where we currently operate. We now have over 600 international client firms active on the platform representing a 17% increase in a number of institutions year-over-year. Our growing footprint in international credit rating significantly expands the long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $231 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to 11% increase in U.S. high-grade TRACE market volume. We completed approximately 5,200 block trades during the second quarter. However, the tailwinds from major short data paper selling programs experienced in the first quarter did not repeat in the second quarter and new issuance was fairly robust in 2Q. Volumes in the other credit category were up 23% year-over-year, while estimated aggregate market volumes for emerging markets high yield and Eurobonds was down 7%. Market share gains was the main driver behind the 32% growth in Eurobond volume and 27% growth in emerging markets volume. Healthy growth in client engagement is evidenced across each of our core products. We now have over 1,450 client firms active on the platform, an increase of over 300 in just the past two years, and we have almost 850 clients trading in three or more products. With five important trading days remaining in July, estimated U.S. high-grade market share is running slightly below the second quarter level and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the second quarter level. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 11% year-over-year. The 16% increase in trading volume drove commissions 10% higher. The $1.1 million uplift in post-trade services revenue is primarily due to a combination of new MiFID II services and the new customers. Expenses were up 16% year- over-year, leading to a 6% increase in operating income. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 10%. The effective tax rate was 23.9% in the second quarter and 22.6% year-to-date. We expect the effective tax rate for full year 2018 will be within the 23% to 25% guidance range. Our diluted EPS was $1.07 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.9 million shares. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 2% year-over-year as the 16% increase in trading volume was offset by the impact of our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter and revisions to the Eurobond fee plan together with the mix shift within certain products. U.S. high-grade fee per million was up $4, compared to the first quarter of 2018, as the mix shift paper and smaller trade size under our tiered fee more plan more than offset lower duration. The $1 million sequential increase in U.S. high-grade distribution fees was principally due to one market maker moving to distribution fee plan. A portion of the distribution fees recognized in the second quarter related to a prior period. We expect that third quarter high-grade distribution fees will be roughly $500,000 lower than the second quarter level. Our other credit category fee capture was down $6 on a sequential basis. At a granular level, fees per million for emerging market incorporates and emerging market sovereigns, European high-grade and high yield and U.S. high-yield, that trades on either a price or spread protocol, were all consistent with the first quarter. That said, there was a mix shift among products with a greater percentage of volume derived from Eurobonds and emerging markets resulting in lower sequential fee capture in the other credit category. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were flat as lower compensation and benefit costs were offset by increases in several other line items, most notably, marketing and advertising. A reduction in the variable bonus accruals which is tied directly to operating performance and seasonally lower employment taxes and benefits accounted for the $2.6 million drop in compensation and benefits costs. The timing of various programs and events greatly influences the quarterly marketing and advertising expense. We believe the second quarter level is more indicative of the run rate for marketing and advertising expenses for the next two quarters. Our full year 2018 expenses are projected to fall in the lower half of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million, inclusive of approximately $8 million in duplicate rent expense. On Slide 12 we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of June 30 were $420 million, compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the second quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $16 million and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $3.6 million. We also spent $9 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12 months pretax flow was a record $169 million. Based on these results, our board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We were pleased with the overall growth in trading activity during the quarter. Most importantly, we are seeing good progress on long-term growth priorities, including Open Trading and international expansion. The increased investment in trading automation by both dealer investor clients is a clear sign that the future of electronic trading in credit is bright. Now I'd be happy to open the line for your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Excuse me. So first question, I guess, is on probably like you noted some of the micro-lot, fixed assets, you said you're having there, I think, it’s mostly on the institutional side, obviously, but there are some retail assets you looked that last year, they didn't end up winning. But at that time, it sounded like there was analysis done regarding this build versus buy mentality for the retail space. And it sounded like you may be kind of looking at developing some point to quick the trade functionality for – to introduce this year. Just wondering has that been an investment priority this year? And then is there something you anticipate rolling out more directly in the retail space, I guess, over the near to medium term?
Rick McVey: Yes, that’s a good question, Kyle. Thank you for that. But I think we're very highly comfortable that our liquidity pool is among the most competitive for micro-lot trade sizes. We have not prioritized the investment in the retail segment in the first half of the year, but we continue to look closely as that opportunity that would involve some modest tweaks to the technology platform to suit the retail client segment and some improved focus on sales and marketing towards that community. Not only are we active in micro-lots, we have a tremendous amount of overlap in the market makers that are active in small tickets for institutions and also make markets in the retail segment. So we are engaged with those market makers and increasingly talking to participants in the retail segment and that is, we think, a long-term opportunity for the company to look at how we could enter that space organically.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, fair enough. The second question will just be on Open Trading, just given the record percentage of your volume in the quarter at 21%. Can you just talk about, I guess longer-term, what internally, like what targets do you have? Or where do you think that can go as a percentage of your total market – of your total volume? And then I guess, what kind of timeframe do you think it will take you to get there?
Rick McVey: I don't know whether we have a specific target on where Open Trading percentages will go. Our focus has always been on broadening and deepening our liquidity pool to better serve our clients. And the best part of Open Trading is it's the most important thing we think we have done to add new liquidity, and broaden liquidity pool and improve execution quality. So judging by the rapid growth in the last few years, we would expect Open Trading to be at significantly higher percentage of our volume. That said, dealers continue to be a very important part of the liquidity pool, and we expect that to be the case, especially in larger trades and less liquid bonds. So there will always be in our mind to balance between traditional clients and dealer activity on the platform and Open Trading activity.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then last one from me. Just to follow-up on Open Trading. You gave a kind of breakdown of Open Trading penetration between your different products. It looks the Eurobond and EM uptake of Open Trading continues to grow pretty rapidly from a lower base than some of the other products. Can you just talk about what's changed there in each of those buckets in EM and Eurobonds in the past year, whether it would be regulatory changes driving increased adoption, or protocol changing? I think you introduced may be local EM site. But yes, could you kind of highlight what's changed and what the outlook is there? Thank you.
Rick McVey: Yes, thank you for that. I think we mentioned in last quarter's calls that we have – call that we made some technology changes in Open Trading for Eurobonds. And that has made it easier for market makers to respond to Open Trading orders, and we've seen the benefit of that through greater Open Trading activity in Eurobonds. We've also introduced some new protocols that have been important to investors. So really, we think that's been mostly some technology enhancements that we've been able to deliver to make it easier for market participants to respond in Eurobonds. On the EM side, I think, it's just organic adoption as the quarters roll on. And dealers and investors are seeing more trading opportunities available in EM in the open order book. The behavior is changing and we're seeing better price responses coming back. Most of it is in external debt. It is very difficult to solve the riddle around trade settlement in many of the EM local markets. We' re working through that one market at a time. But the bonds that trade and settle through Euroclear are significantly easier for our trade settlement than many of the local markets. So it is organic growth in EM, Open Trading activity primarily in external debt markets.
Kyle Voigt: Great, and thanks I will hop back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Rich Repetto: Yes good morning Rick. Good morning Tony.
Rick McVey: Good morning Rich.
Tony DeLise: Good morning Rich.
Rich Repetto: So not to beat this anymore, but tremendous success with the Open Trading. And I guess, what surprises me, and this is reflected in the other numbers as well as, but as the previous call said the penetration, but your volume in Open Trading was up quarter-to-quarter off the robust first quarter levels. So I guess, my question is how much – what's driving – from the first quarter to now, there had to be some changes to get this penetration, like what's the incremental change that actually saw your penetration go up so much, your volume go up in Open Trading when overall volume was down, I think, 9%, 9.5%? 
Rick McVey: I think it's a sign as a growing acceptance of all-to-all trading in credit. It's really all cylinders contributing to the sequential growth that we announced this morning Rich, that dealer community is using Open Trading more actively for their own source of liquidity. It's an increasingly valuable tool for them to turn their balance sheets over more rapidly and move bonds off their balance sheet that may have become aged. Investors are responding to more trade inquiries as they see opportunities rolling through. And then, the third piece is really what I talked about earlier in trading automation and the increased use of algos, they can't go to work whether it's a disclosed inquiry or anonymous inquiry. So I think all three pieces of that are combining to create a much more valuable marketplace and source of liquidity for both our dealer and investor clients. 
Rich Repetto: And again, not to get too deep into this, Rick, but, but the volume being up, but if you look quarter-to-quarter, again, the price responses were down. The 802,000 price responses down from 820,000 so we may be getting too far in the weeds in this. But just a last follow-up on this is block trading as a lower percentage – was it also the size of trades block trading being a lower percentage 2Q versus 1Q that helps Open Trading? 
Rick McVey: Yes, that could be a piece of it too. I think that's a reasonable observation. As I mentioned, I think, a very modest decrease in price responses had much more to do with market conditions than anything else. As you know looking at the other companies you cover, the second quarter was significantly quieter than the first. And we were the beneficiary of better interest rate and credit spread volatility in Q1 and the changing investors' sentiment drove a lot of short and block programs on the system and created the best block quarter that we had ever had. That was not the case in Q2. You saw a much lower levels of volatility in both credit spreads and interest rates. I think I saw this morning that we had 21 days where the 10 year note was stuck in a seven basis point range. So it was just a different quarter, and I think that was the primary driver of slightly reduced trading activity levels across the platform and slightly fewer price responses.
Rich Repetto: Got it, and just one last regulatory, I guess, sort of follow-up or question. During the quarter, the SEC Commissioner Jackson, who I know you know, talked in – I think he was quoted saying that the fixed income markets were – had conflicts of interest hidden costs and were – just did not provide a level playing field. You're on the fixed income advisory committee. And I guess, the question is, how much action – or what could we expect in the second half of the year in regards to regulation or, let's just say, the next 18 months in the fixed income markets since you are so close to it? And how would that – do see that benefiting market access and the electronic platforms?
Rick McVey: Sure, well, thanks for that. And coincidently, FIMSAC just met a week ago, and the subcommittee that I chair on e-trading and trading and technology, made the one recommendation of the day this quarter for the SEC to really revisit and consider modernizing the regulatory framework for fixed-income e-trading which is currently fragmented because what you find is the platforms that have protocols that look closer to cross matching, primarily to retail platforms are regulated primarily as ATS systems and report their volumes as ATS. However, the institutional market, which has favored RFQ protocols really does not fit with the current ATS framework whatsoever. So we are today primarily in regulated as broker dealers. And so we think that there – it is an important time for the SEC to focus on fixed income e-trading and make sure that they're mitigating risk around any systematic risk in the industry, make sure that the regulatory framework is consistently applied across all platforms. And what we recommended is that the SEC form a working group with FINRA and the MSRB to make sure that there is a thoughtful and consistent regulatory framework that emerges without redundancies. The other risks that we see is that if all three of them continue to regulate different pockets of the e-trading industry, there will be redundancies that really don't pass any cost benefit analysis. So that was universally supported by FIMSAC week and half ago. I think that led to Commissioner Jackson's comments, which you saw on Jackson's comments, which you saw on the media, and I do expect that this working group will be up and running and that there will be focus on this topic in the second half of this year. We view it as a good thing. We think that improving the soundness and best practices around e-trading for the entire industry will be a good thing for market participants in the U.S. fixed income. And we are highly supportive, we are regulated in parts as an ATS and parts as a broker-dealer and of course, as a public company with public reporting. So we are supportive. We think this will be a good thing for the e-trading markets in fixed income.
Rich Repetto: Got it. Thanks for the update Rick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy : Hey, god morning guys. First I was hoping, if you could speak to some of the puts and takes in your information services and post-trade services revenues in the second quarter? And what your expectations are going to be like for the remainder of the year? 
Tony DeLise: Sure, Patrick. [Indiscernible] probably sticks out more as on the post-trade services side. And in the prepared remarks, I was commenting year-over-year on what drove that change, which is really due MiFID II related services and new customers associated with that. When you look at sequentially post-trade services was down around $1 million sequentially. And there's several items, all of them around a couple of hundred thousand dollars, which drove that variance. So we didn't have a repeat of some nonrecurring MiFID II implementation fees that was a couple of hundred thousand dollars. The dollar did strengthen in the second quarter versus the first quarter. That was a couple of hundred thousand dollars. And then there was – there are clients that are on variable plans where dependent on their volume activity, it does influence revenue as well. So you tally those up and you see the post-trade services revenue down around $1 million-or-so. Looking forward, the growth there, it is going to dependent on new clients and new services. And we do think over the next several quarters, the quarterly run rate will look a bit better than what you saw in 2Q. So assume if you look at the Q2 numbers, assume going forward, we'll be somewhere in that $3.5 million to $4 million range for post-trade services. On the information services side, which is namely data revenue, it's our bond secured data service volume, pricing, liquidity data, it's our Axess All servicing and reference data It was up around 7% year-over-year. If you look historically for that business strike, we've grown revenue around 10% per year. The vast majority of that revenues is recurring. And we do have a fairly robust pipeline that we're – that are various levels of closure and expect that information services line, we still feel good around that 10% growth there year-over-year.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy : Great, thank you for that detail. I guess, you guys touched on block trading a little bit, but I don't know if I caught what your market share of block trading was in the second quarter? 
Tony DeLise: Yes, so Patrick, we didn't state what the block trade number was, but you recall in the first quarter we were – we ended up a little bit shy of 11% in the first quarter. And in the second quarter, we were just a little bit north of 9%, which – that's pretty consistent with where we were in full year 2017. And really the main driver there, in the first quarter around the interest rate movement, principally right in the middle of the first quarter, there were a number of short dated selling programs in the marketplace. We saw a lot of that activity on our platform. We did not see a repeat of that in the second quarter.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy : Okay, great. And I guess, maybe a final question, a bigger picture question. So we've seen a lot of growth. It would seem like in some of the retail-oriented trading platforms, the ones that had the streaming executable trading quotes. And I think there is some data that suggest that the quotes are actually reasonably small, although maybe there is not a whole lot of depth of book at the inside quote. Do you think we're at a point where the market structure is ready for streaming quotes to move up market and for institutions to be able to – be willing to trade off of that type of protocol? Or do you think that request for quote is going to remain dominant trading protocol for some period of time?
Rick McVey: Yes, it’s a good question, Patrick. It's – I think you're seeing increased automation and trading at all levels of the client spectrum. Our understanding is that the retail and ATS system, the average trade sizes tend to be around $30,000 or $40,000, so it’s very different business than the institutional platforms operate today. Most of what is streaming are offers on those platforms. The bid type, as we understand it, tends to be more RFQ. And we are actively engaged with the market makers that are active both on our platform and on the retail systems, and I think you get a mixed view on whether they're ready for a true central limit order book and whether they see that as a benefit to their business model or not. So to date, the evidence is that for the institutional market, they're getting more competitive levels from RFQ protocols. They've been able to trade on the retail platforms if they choose to for many years. And there's not much time that they've gone there at this point. And I think the reason is that right now, they see more competitive pricing through RFQ protocols. But this is something we have to keep a close eye on. We do have that micro-lot liquidity base, and if market makers and clients believe that they're ready for a full live environment, that is something that we have to be prepared to provide. From a technology standpoint, we think it's fairly straightforward for us to add that protocol. The message from clients today is mixed. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy : Great, that’s very helpful, thank you guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Allen from Compass Point your line is now open.
Chris Allen : Good morning guys.
Rick McVey: Good morning Chris.
Chris Allen : Thanks for the color on July in terms of the market share. I was wondering if you could give us maybe a little bit more flavor in terms of how the environment's shaping up relative to 2Q. It looks like volumes according to BondTicker for high-grade and high yield are down decent amount, but obviously, the July 4th week there. So any color just in terms of the July environment and maybe how the month has been progressing whether it's starting to pick back up, again, in the back half of the month or it's just consistent with the course of the month?
Tony DeLise: Sure, Chris. So it's been pretty typical July from a market volume standpoint. And when you look at the tepid trading around 4 of July, every year, we have that same anomaly. If you took the first, like, 10 trading days of the month versus the second 10 trading days, you get it, so why is the different answer. Right now, we're looking at U.S. credit looking at high-grade and high-yield market volumes compared to, say, July of last year at the same point in time, they are running about 5% lower right now. So a little bit softer, but I would just caution that we still have five trading days left here in the month. And I think not that I would guarantee anything, but I could pretty much guarantee that more than quarter of the volume is still ahead of us. There's still five days left, it's a 21-day month, and it was pretty slow and pretty unusual to have 4 of July fall right [indiscernible]. And the other thing, Chris, just from a market condition standpoint, the new issue calendar really in that first week, the week of the 4 of July, was shut down. What we've seen from the last two weeks is a much healthier new issuance. So that is a little bit different than what you saw in the first half of the month. 
Chris Allen : Thanks, that’s helpful.
Rick McVey: And just to expand on that a little bit, Chris, over the medium term, one of the things that we're watching is the great unwind of quantitive easing around the world. The Fed has, obviously, stopped their quantitative easing program and allowing the balance sheet and bonds to slowly mature and wind down. The ECB should be on the quantitative easing by the end of this year, and you've seen some recent comments from the Bank of Japan. I personally think that's a big deal, right? That was a massive program collectively across the central banks around the world. They had been buying an awful lot of government bonds, in the case of ECB, quite a few corporate bonds. So I think that that will actually be an important event in terms of the market environment over the coming quarters. And it will be interesting on the treasury side because the Fed is no longer buying treasury bonds and the treasury is about to start issuing a lot more bonds. So I do think that the likelihood is that the market environment will improve as we see this gradual unwind of quantitative easing. 
Chris Allen : Thanks. One thing that caught my eye recently was recent reports just a news article about liquidity, particularly over in Europe, and corporate bond markets being a bit challenged, could be using more derivatives there in the credit markets. Wondering how your – like whether you've seen similar action and how you guys are thinking about the impact of that theoretically on you guys?
Rick McVey: Yes. In some of the European government markets, the futures contract have more liquidity than the underlying cash market. So that's been the case for a long time. So it's not surprising in a market like Italy when ball picks up that the primary beneficiary is the futures market more so than the cash market. Hasn't really been the case on the credit side. We did see slightly lower volumes during Q2, which we think is related to lower volatility. But we don't really see the same impact on the credit side.
Tony DeLise: And if you look at EM year-to-date, there has been more caution in the EM markets over the course of this year. But our best estimate is that EM volumes year-to-date are down 7% or 8% from where they were first half of last year.
Chris Allen : Got it. And just a quick numbers question. Compensation declined sequentially from the first quarter. I'm assuming lower variable comp and obviously some seasonality. But I'm guessing hiring kind of continues, how do we think about the trajectory of that line moving forward?
Tony DeLise: Yes Chris, so the – when you look at sequentially, you're right. It wasn't a variable comp line. That was about half of the delta. And our variable compensation pool is very formulaic. So it's – it is tied directly to the operating income. So when you see revenues decline from Q1 to Q2, it does have a direct impact on the variable bonus accrual. Going forward and looking at the second half of the year, we would expect an uptick in that line compared to the second quarter. So right now, looking at the sort of the headcount picture, we are tracking about 30 new hires expected to start in the third quarter. About half of those are with our new analyst – sales and technology program. So we are tracking a fair number of headcount to join here in the third quarter. So you would expect some uptick there. But when you look at it overall, I had some comments in the prepared remarks around overall expenses, and what we're looking at right now, if you look at that guidance range we gave, what I said was we're tracking towards the lower half of that guidance range. There are still some swing factors in there, but you we feel pretty good about being in the lower half of that guidance range right now.
Chris Allen : Great, thanks guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys, good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning Chris.
Chris Shutler: In the second quarter, I guess, I would have thought that with the volume on some of the big high-yield ETFs growing pretty nicely in the quarter that market share in high yield would have been up a little bit more. I know there's always lot of puts and takes, but maybe just could put that in perspective for me?
Tony DeLise: Chris, on the high-yield side, what we saw on our platform was a little bit less of a bid wanted market. We do better when the order flow is more weighed toward bid wanted. We did see volatility drop in the high-yield market. And for us, the ETF community is an important element of our high- yield business. And we track the percentage of their volumes or overall volume. It did decline in the second quarter. So they were a little bit less active. 
Chris Shutler: Okay, that helps, Tony. Just one bigger picture question. Rick, I want to get your thoughts on some of these fixed income data aggregation platforms, so ALFA probably being the best known one. Obviously, really early days, but how do you look at the kind of the long-term competitive risk from those? And in other words, is it, in your view, really important to own the traders desktop?
Rick McVey: Yes, there is quite a bit of movement on data aggregation across the industry. We're tracking about a 12 or13 different data aggregators in the EM that's faced currently and that numbers seems to grow every quarter. So there are more solutions out there. I think it's another sign that clients have more data available to them ever before and they need technology tools to aggregate and filter the data to make sense of it for their trading operation.  We think it's a natural evolution of the market. And we are not only on the desktops clients today, we're also offering aggregation and EMS tools ourselves. So it's very early to predict where it will all end up, but I think it's logical to expect and institutional investors are going to increasingly look for aggregation tools. The important piece for us, Chris, in all this is the differentiated liquidity pool. And I think historically we've done a very good job of that and it has been for lack of competition.  And EMS tools may make it easier for people to direct traffic to different platforms of their choosing. But we've passed the test of time by constantly innovating and adding to our liquidity pool in order to differentiate the transaction costs and pricing available on the platform, and I think that's the key for us. 
Chris Shutler: Right, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill, your line is now open.
Rich Repetto: Rick, I apologize, if you mentioned this. But I'm getting a bunch of e-mails to ask you what your actual volume in July to date is? 
Rick McVey: You got a curious client base, Rich. I think, Tony, touched on it. It was an unusual fourth of July week with the holiday falling right in the middle of the week. And so I think if you look at the TRACE numbers, you'll see significantly lower average daily volumes in high-grade and high-yield credit during that week. If you look at the numbers since then, it's pretty close to normal. So I think this all balances out over the quarter, but it was an unusual holiday week with the 4th on a Wednesday. The only thing that I would reiterate and that comments that Tony already made on share that month-to-date high-grade share is running a bit below Q1 average and high-yield share is running significantly above the Q2 average. So we've got a mixed bag, and it's two or three weeks of trading, so I wouldn't read too much into at any case.
Rich Repetto: Okay, and I did want to follow up on your volume comments and the quantitative – the pull back on quantitative easing. I guess, I think, most of us in the – we're trying to understand the volumes. I think everybody sees it down across the board and trying to figure out whether there's anything incremental beyond just July 4th seasonality and things like that. And – so I guess, the question is, do you feel like this is all – or do you think it's more a seasonality here with the volumes? Or do you think that as we go through this transition of quantitative easing that will – could go through a low in volumes before the market sort of takes over and steps in?
Rick McVey: See, I think in the short term it's seasonality. We're in July and we had a very soft week over the July 4, volatility is our friend. There is no question about that in our minds, when vol picks up we do better. And we saw a vol pickup in Q1 in both interest rates and credit spreads, and you saw the best results the company has ever produced. So we will do better when volatility is higher. And over the medium term, I think the odds are that both interest rate and credit spread volatility will be higher, not lower, but we're in a bit of an air pocket here right now where if you look at our treasury yields and credit spreads, they've been pretty stable over the last two or three months.
Rich Repetto: Got it, that’s helpful Rick, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Rick McVey, Chief Executive Officer for any further remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. Enjoy the rest of summer, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter, and will provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain. The Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company’s future results, please see the descriptions of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31st, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2018 results. This morning, we reported first quarter results driven by record trading volume of $465 billion up 18% compared to Q1, 2017. Additionally, volume records would set this quarter across each of our four core products. Our estimated U.S. high grade market share also reached a record of 18% this quarter up from 15.9%. On the back of strong trading volumes, first quarter revenues were a record $115 million, up 11% compared to Q1, 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $60 million up 9% from a year ago and diluted EPS was up 14% to a new high of $1.27. Expenses of $54.5 million were up 14% including $1.7 million in duplicate rent expense for Hudson Yards. As per the double rent charge, EPS would have been up 17% year-over-year. Open trading adoption continues to accelerate and reached record volume of $81 billion up 38%. Additionally, the trading volume with international clients reached a record $130 billion this quarter, representing an increase of 30%. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Overall secondary trading conditions improved modestly in the first quarter. Interest rate moved higher and volatility improved in both interest rate and credit spreads. Overall trade’s high grade market volumes in Q1 were relatively flat year-on-year while high yield trades volumes were down 4%. As a result our trading volume and revenue growth was driven primarily by market share gains. New issuance was down 13% versus last years’ first quarter. U.S. credit mutual fund in close continue to be strong. We are pleased with our results in the context of the market environment and remain confident in the secular trend towards greater electronic trading in global credit markets. Slide five provides an update on open trading. Open traded volumes were $81 million in the first quarter with average daily volume of $1.3 billion up 40% from the same period last year. Open trading represented 17.5% of our volume in Q1 up from 15% last year. Approximately 204,000 open trading transactions were completed in the first quarter up from 147,000 in Q1, 2017. Liquidity providers or price makers on the platform drove 820,000 price responders representing a 71% increase in activity in the first quarter. Liquidity takers staged an estimated $32 million in transaction costs through open trading on the system up 28% from the first quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.4 basis points in yield when they completed a U.S. high grade transaction through open traded protocols. In a recent Greenwich Associate survey, investment managers citied price improvements and all-to-all trading as the two most important factors for selecting a trading venue. Slide six provides an update on our international progress and MiFID II. The momentum in our international business continued in the first quarter. MiFID II implementation contributed growth in European Client traded volumes and post trade revenue. European Client volume was up 29% year-over-year led by a 52% increase in emerging market volume and a 22% increase in euro bond volume. In addition, Trax’s post-trade services revenue increased by $2.1 million in Q1 primarily due to MiFID II regulatory reporting services and non-recurring MiFID II implementation fees. European data revenues were up 25%. In Asia, client onboard Inc. is accelerating with our new regulated trading venue in Singapore. To date, over 35 dealers and 80 investor clients are engaged on the RM level. Our emerging markets business continues its strong growth trajectory with first quarter record trading volume of $105 billion up 33%. Approximately 940 firms are now active in global EM trading on the system. In addition, the EM External debt trading we are encouraged by the progress we are making in local currency bonds. Trading volume in the 25 local EM markets available on the system grew by 43% during the quarter with further progress in block trades. Volume from international clients now represents 28% of global volume up from 18% three years ago. Now let me turn the call over to Tony, for more detail on the financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high grade volumes were $251 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Higher estimated market share accounted for the vast majority of the volume gain as U.S. high grade trades to market volume was up an estimated 1%. We completed approximately 66,000 block trades during the first quarter, almost double the number in just two years ago. And our estimated market share of U.S. high grade trade over 5 million in trade size was potentially 9% during the first quarter and is a big contributor to the 2.1 percentage point increase in overall market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 25% year-over-year as our emerging markets high yield and euro bond trading volume all hit records during the quarter. Sooner, the U.S. high grade market share gains were the main driver behind the emerging markets high-yield and euro bond volume growth. [April had seen a reverent] to 2017 type market conditions with the decline in volatility and credit spreads. Aggregate estimated market volumes for our core products are down around 14% from the first quarter levels. With four important trading days remaining in April, estimated U.S. high grade and high yield market share is running below first quarter levels but similar to share posted in January. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall, revenue was up 11% year-over-year. The increase in trading volume drove commission 9% higher. The uplift in post trade services revenue is due to a combination of new customers and met a few surfaces and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar versus the Pound Sterling. Operating expenses were up 14% year-over-year leading to a 9% increase in operating income. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build out phase of the company’s new corporate offices in New York City operating income was up 12%. The effective tax rate was 21.4% in the first quarter and reflects a reduction in the federal income tax rate and other changes associated with the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act and $1.8 million in access cash benefits related to share based compensational awards. As mentioned on the January earnings call, we expect the effective tax rate for the next three quarters will be roughly 25%. Now diluted EPS was $1.27 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.9 million shares. On slide nine, we have laid up our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 3% year-over-year as the 18% increase in trading volume was offset by mix shift within certain products and the impact of our new high yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017. US high grade fee capture was down both sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017 and year-over-year. There are three primary reasons our U.S. high grade fee capture varies from period to period. First, our [fee plan is tiered] based on ticket size, second the fee we earned are dependent on bond duration and third, we give dealers a choice of fee plan. The sequential decline in high grade fees per million reflects the higher percentage of volume traded in modular sized buckets and lower duration caused by a decline in years to maturity. Our product credit category we captured was down $11 on a sequential basis. Approximately half of the variance was due to Eurobond fee schedule changes implemented effective January 1st. We also experienced the typical swing resulting from mix shifts namely higher percentage in emerging market volumes in sovereign bonds. Slide 10 provides you with the expense details. Sequentially expenses were up 10% largely due to higher compensation benefits cost. The variable bond -- was $3.7 million higher and the employment taxes and benefits were up reflecting the first, the typical first quarter seasonality. The sequential increase in occupancy cost is due to the duplicate rent expense of $1.7 million. On a year-over-year basis expenses were up 14%. Excluding the duplicate rent expense and the impact of foreign currency movement from the weaker dollar, the year-over-year increase in total expenses was approximately 7%. Roughly 10% increase in average headcount drove the $1.6 million uplift in compensation and benefits cost. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of March 31 were $400 million compared to $407 million at year end 2017. During the first quarter, we paid out our yearend of full year bonuses and related taxes of roughly $32 million and the quarterly cash dividend of $16 million. We also repurchased 72,000 shares in total during the quarter, including 31,000 under our share buyback program and 41,000 associated with tax obligation net downs upon investing of employee stock awards. As of March 31, approximately $88 million was available for future repurchases under the share buyback program. Based on the first quarter results, our board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased to see the improvement in the secondary market environment leading to record volumes and market share in the quarter. MiFID II implementation has created additional momentum in our European and International business. Adoption of open trading is accelerating leading to important transaction cost savings for our clients. Now I'd be happy to open the lines for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys, good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Chris.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Shutler: So I think over the last year or two, you seen more dealers auto quoting for smaller trade sizes, just want to get your take on what inning you think we are in, in that trend with the bigger dealers and is that happening mostly today on trades under a million, two million I think that’s somewhere in the range. And to what extent are you seeing those thresholds increase?
Rick McVey: Sure, I’d better take that one Chris. There has been a significant increase [in algo] generated price responses over the last two years. As far as where we are I would say probably fourth or fifth inning we are seeing new dealers come on with algos virtually every quarter. Most of the trade prices are sub 1 million and even more specifically probably sub 500,000. But I think what you are seeing is a transformation of high grade trading where dealers increasingly are responding through algos, and client adoption of our execution is picking up as well, whereby when certain parameters are met with the price responses they receive they execute that trade without manual intervention as well. I think this is a really important development for the market. You are all aware that nearly 90% of tickets reported their trades are under $1 million. So this is another way that we can significantly increase the efficiency of trading smaller tickets in lower costs for both dealer and investor clients.
Chris Shutler: Right, great thanks, Rick. And then regarding block trades, so good progress there especially on shorter duration paper. I’m assuming you look at blocks share by duration, so can you give us a sense of what – to what extent you are seeing improvements in longer duration paper as well, if at all. Thanks.
Rick McVey: Sure, I’ll take that one as well. It was a great quarter for us for block trading. The big story starting the year was the increase in economic activity in the world, some uptick in inflation numbers and growing expectation that the fed will move rates up more quickly than people had anticipated. On the back of that, it led to quite a bit of short end activity and we were pleased to see many block list come into the market are consistent and receive great pricing leading to a record numbers in blocks or record share. As Tony mentioned, it was a quarter over more of those block trades and block list. We’re at the shorter end of the curve, which was one of the factors that reduced the fee capture in high grade during the quarter. We had seen improvement out of the curve as well, but this quarter the majority of the activity was in – within block trade three years and under a maturity.
Chris Shutler: Okay. And then lastly guys the expanded relationship with Blackrock in Asia, just maybe talk about what that means, kind of be on the marketing message, what it means on the ground? Thanks.
Rick McVey: Well I think you know as Blackrock has been a very important partner for us. And with their full support and activity we have made great progress with open trading in the U.S. increasing momentum in Europe and this is the third leg to really promote open trading throughout the Asia region. So as I have mentioned before there are lots of components of that partnership with Blackrock, one is they fully support the move – to all trading with their trading activity. We get excellent advice from them on protocols and things what they believe would work well in the market and the piece that’s also an important part for both of us is the integration with the Latin client network. And so all those parts are in motion with the extension of our joint venture with Blackrock into the Asia region.
Chris Shutler: All right. Thank you guys.
Operator: And our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Rich Repetto: Yes, hi Rick, hi Tony. Good morning. So I guess the first question is on the fee per million and China understand and sort of the pricing dynamics. Can you give us any you know if rates continue to go up, with the different moving parts and you sort of outlined what moves the rate per million. How would you expect it to generally play out. Is it a general trend? If you looked over the last you know [Indiscernible] turned it down. If you looked way back before rates went down to zero, you know the high grade was significantly less so, so any scenario analysis that you’ve done that sort of can help us think about the rates going forward?
Tony DeLise: Rich, we can. And I said three big items in the prepared remarks around trade size, duration and the dealer choice on the fee plan. And at times we've given some guidance or rule of thumb on how to look at those variables and you just to put in perspective. The yields movements is probably the least important of those three items, so if you had a for example, a one percentage point change across the yield curve, that could equate to something like $10 or $15 per million and that's all out equal that would give a rule of thumb or sensitivity around the yield change. When I say the bigger pieces they're probably – they are probably around maturity and even the dealer mix has a big influence. On the maturity side, we did see some of that impact in the first quarter where yes the maturity came in almost one year versus the fourth quarter. Every year the maturity could be $10 or $15 per million as well, so you have some influence there. I would tell you this on a longer terms basis, if you look at the high water mark for fees per million for high-grade which was a little over $200 per million, by far and away the largest impact has to do with the dealer mix or the dealer choice of plans. Today we have 33 dealers on the distribution fee plan. When we hit high water mark of $205 per million, we had 22 dealers on the plan. So, if you recall there's a just a geography switched in where we have more fees coming through distribution fees and lower fees coming through variable fees. So longer term it’s a dealer choice influence the outcome significantly. Shorter term you see those mixes around duration and around trade size as well.
Rich Repetto: And I know longer term as far as revenue and I guess that's where we're all focused on, but longer term you would increase revenue, but when you expect more dealers to go to – just the 33 number to go up and maybe volumes go up, but fee capture decline as you say it’s a biggest factor?
Tony DeLise: It's tough to predict what the dealers are going to do. We do provide choices in particular in U.S. high-grade and high-yield. It's tough to predict what dealers are doing. They're responding to their own forecast and projection. They're responding to the economics of our fee plan, so it's tough to predict. Every time we say we're not tracking any dealers who are going to migrate up. We get one or two, but right now we have 33 under distribution fee plan and another 40 or so on the variable plan. So there is a potential for moment, but right now we're not tracking anything.
Rich Repetto: Got it. Okay. And then just one last question, quick question on expenses, so I saw the head count was flat from year end, expenses were certainly below what we expected and I guess the question is the expense guidance remains the same for the year, so did some of the sort of the expense increases get pushed out and would be later in the year versus in the first quarter?
Rick McVey: Rich, by not saying anything on the expense guidance we can figure out that we're still expecting 2018 expenses to fall within that range. And there is still some swing factors that we have going forward. I'll tell you head count is one of those swing factors which I'll comment on the second, but where we come out in headcount could move the expenses up or down. The variable bonus accruals tie the performance, so that's the swing factor there. And I'll give you one more which is just on the foreign exchange movement where we have around 45 million in expenses and that FX movement influence where we come out, but right now we're expecting to be within the range. If you look at Q1 versus the expectation for the rest of the year, we do expect tech have to go up. We've been pretty at forecasting headcount for the last several years. We do expect headcount from this point forward to go by about 10%, so you figured another 40 to 45 bodies we expect to add by the end of the year. And with that one almost half of those positions are already filled, so between new hires starting in April and May we have an analyst programs that for those new hires come in later in the summer. We've got half of the bodies that are in committed already, so you would expect compensation to go up. And the other one that I would tell just if you are isolating line items, you'd expect to go up. On the marketing and advertising line, it is dependent on advertising campaign. It's dependent on trade show participation. What you saw in the first is not indicative of what you're going to see in Q2, Q3, and Q4. You will see an increase in that line item going forward.
Rich Repetto: Understood. Thanks, Tony and thanks Rick.
Rick McVey: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess first is on the post-trade line obviously really strong growth you realized in the first quarter. I think you mentioned that some of those may be one-time implementation fees for MiFID. Just wondering if you could kind of break those out and maybe help us frame if there's a new range for the revenue growth for that post-trade line versus the greater than 20% growth you had said previously?
Tony DeLise: Yes. You saw we reported was about $2.1 million increase year-over-year in post-trade in three quarters of that, that is new customers and new services related to MiFID II. So that's – the largest chunk is we do believe this repeatable. There were some implementation fees, it was around $300,000, so I would take that out, that's more one-time in non-recurring. We also had the same foreign exchange impact and that would have been maybe around $400,000 or so. If you're looking going out the next several quarters and that's probably as good as we're going to get in terms of projecting out, we would expect revenues to be in that $4 million to $4.5 million per quarter. So you see the sort of step function increased from last year to this year that is MiFID II driven. Going forward its going to be dependent on our ability to bring new customers on line to add new services, but looking at what we have is sort of a crystal ball right now for the next several quarters, I'd narrow that – to that arrange to $4 to $4.5 million per quarter.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, great. Just a follow-up, I guess on the block trading as well. I think you said a decent portion of the 2.1% market share gain was from block trading. Looking at the charts and the slide deck it looks like about half of that in the right range. And then also if you could help us understand what the average capture rate is on those block trades during the quarter?
Tony DeLise: So, Kyle, the good news on the market share. We had market share gains across all size bucket so it wasn't that – it's a block trading. If you look at 100,000 million to 1 million, 1 million to 5 million trade size, over 5 million in trade size. There was pretty robust gains across the board. And yes, it was probably about half of the gain was from the block trading. On the fee capture, it’s a harder one to answer. On the block trading peaks it does vary from period to period, it is depended on duration as well, but if you were looking at over 10 million in trade size. Remember our fee plan doesn't exactly match up with the trade's block designation, but if you look at over 10 billion in trade size, its somewhere between $50 to $60 per million.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. All right. That's really helpful. And last one from me is just a question on open trading. I think you disclosed Eurobond specifically, 13% of Eurobond volume was open trading. I thought it was lower than that maybe 5% or so last year just due to fact that buy side clients maybe weren't as comfortable using a price protocol to respond to inquiries. Just wondering if that 5% number I just quoted was accurate for last year? And if you're seeing good uptake in Open Trading and Eurobond specifically and I guess what's driving that if so?
Tony DeLise: We are seeing good uptake and it’s a result of introducing new protocols for European Open Trading. Kyle, so we're pleased with the progress that we're starting to make there. There's more work to be done, because of the challenges with price page protocols that you mentioned. But we have introduced some new protocols over the last three or four months and it just clearly making a difference.
Kyle Voigt: Great. Thank you very much.
Tony DeLise: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Conor Fitzgerald: Hi, good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Conor.
Conor Fitzgerald: Maybe just follow-up on Kyle question, obviously another good quarter for Open Trading, just longer term as this business continues to grow how should we think about this impacting your balance sheet flexibility? And then I just want to get your thoughts on how we should be thinking about the prospects for maybe larger role for clearing in this product say five years, just be curious how you think this product works in 2023 for example?
Tony DeLise: Do you take the second one? I'll take about the balance sheet.
Rick McVey: You go ahead. You start with the balance sheet.
Tony DeLise: So on the balance sheet, Conor, the nature of our Open Trading business today is matched principal trading using a clearing agent. It really does not influence our regulatory capital requirement. Having said that, we are consciously holding excess capital in our regulated entities, so if you look at end of March we had somewhere around $100 million of excess capital in the regulated entities and that to support open trading. I guess my counterparties up to trade through us. If we look at estimated credit losses based on historical default models and even if we use stress environment, the output is significantly lower than the capital that's residing in the business is great now. So we're comfortable with the balance sheet position. So that even if we – and we will, this Open Trading will continue grow even at multiples than what we're trading today. We still feel that we have healthy capital position does get – help to get counterparties comfortable with our credit. So no change in the immediate view around the excess capital we were retaining in the regulated entities.
Rick McVey: On the longer term outlook for settlements I would expect that we would see positive progress in the industry as a whole and continuing to reduce settlement period, so the capital at risk will decline with shorter settlement periods and we have a huge benefit in real-time digital, post-trade messages that are going to our dealer and investor clients and as electronic trading continues to grow we believe there's further opportunity to use those digital messages to reduce this settlement time from the current two days in corporate bonds. And I think as our activity grows we are working on long-term solutions. We are as you know working with the settlement partner today. We would expect at some time to examine more carefully the pros and cons for self-clearing, but we would expect to be part of industry initiatives around how to improve the efficiency of trade settlement overall. And this is where I think you'll see the most progress and we would be big supporters of that clearly because we think that would be yet another benefit of greater electronic trading in the credit markets.
Conor Fitzgerald: That's really helpful color. Thanks. And then, I know you had been pretty clear that one of the drags on your market share gains in 2017 was some of the [e-TFR] traders had really pulled back from the market, just I'm remembering it, I think it was 40% of volume in peak and it was down to more like 20% last year. Just curious how much of pickup in volume you saw from these players given resumptions of some volatility in 1Q?
Rick McVey: It is absolutely better year to-date than where we were especially through the last two or there quarters of last year. And my own view is that we are starting to see the very beginning of global quantitative easing unwinding and that is going to move more quickly over the next three or four quarters. I believe this is a significant change in the market environment versus where we have been over the last eight or nine years with consistent bond buying in all three regions from quantitative easing. And you see a very different posture from the Fed. You see important changes taking place with the ECB and the Bank of Japan also wondering whether they need to keep up this level of stimulus. That to me is a very, very important change for the market that is likely to lead the higher rates and more volatility. And with volatility comes more ETFR activity, so in my opinion the odds are greater that we are on a positive half there with participation from that client segment.
Conor Fitzgerald: Thanks. And maybe just one clarification from me, Tony, the 14% decline number you mentioned was that in reference of the industry or your volumes? Thanks.
Tony DeLise: Yes. The 14% what I referenced was market volume, so what we're seeing coming through trades what we're seeing coming through our Trax business across U.S. high-grade, high-yield emerging markets and Eurobonds we're seeing about 14% decline in market volumes versus the first quarter.
Rick McVey: I would just add to that and tell about a week ago the direction of interest rate had reverse in first couple of months of the year, treasury 10-year yields went up about 40 basis points and then beginning and around mid March when the trade more discussions really heated up, treasury yields went the other way and credit spreads did as well. So we had a short term shift in the market environment, which also created a pause in some of the short end block activity that we have seen in Q1, obviously over the last week the direction of rates has reverse yet again and rates are moving higher, so this situation is pretty fluid but we did have a three-week period there where the market environment different than it had been through most of the first quarter.
Conor Fitzgerald: That's helpful. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning, guys.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Question for you on the initiative that are bunch of dealers are trying to push out in terms of creating an electronic venue for bond issuance allocation, so not the secondary market but the primary market. Is there any second order impact on you guys in terms of if the industry gets comfortable getting their primary allocation like [ETFR] maybe the more comfortable trading on the secondary market electronically?
Rick McVey: There has been new issue technology broadly utilized by the dealer community for many years and much of that is on [Ipreo] today Patrick, so what we've seen in the media is all we know and something is similar to what you're seeing which is that some dealers have a different view of what that technology should look like and what the protocol should be. But we have been peacefully co-exiting with new issue syndicate technology for the entire existence of market access beginning in 2000. And there really isn't [Indiscernible] overlap in the technology solution that's at work for underwriting in syndicate and the technology that we have invested heavily in for secondary trading. So I didn't really don't see that as any significantly change in the landscape between new issue technology in what we do.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. It's helpful. And then I was hoping you can maybe talk about some of the workflow changes that your clients had implement given introduction of MiFID II?
Rick McVey: Yes. A large of it around the new obligations that investments managers have for regulatory reporting, and I'd say, in the near term that has been the biggest changing was the source of the client expansion that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So pretty big change, right, because previous with MiFID I the non-equity reporting requirements reside purely with the dealers. Now they include investment manages. But a lot of that work as you know was going on throughout 2017 so that everyone would be prepared to comply beginning 2018. But it’s a significant change for investment managers in terms of the reg reporting regime with MiFID II. The other part of it is around demonstrating analytical measurements for best execution. This opens up new data sales opportunities for us, which is one of the reasons that we're seeing consistent growth in data sales in Europe. The third part, the prevailing view in Europe is that any low market impact trade is better off on a regulated trading venue where the regulatory reporting obligation shift through the venue. So we think that has done an impact on trading behavior for the low market impact trades resulting in the volume increases that we reported earlier.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. That's helpful. And then last one from me. Do you guys have the ability to look at the yield curve and look at how changes the yield curve has impacted the revenue caps on the past and say, okay, given what the yield curve looks right now here's how that might impact your high-grade pricing or there just too many variables involved to really trade that analysis?
Rick McVey: Patrick, there's so much of work in so many different levered that impacts fee capture and we're talking specifically about U.S. high-grade here. We could go back and look at longer term trends and look at the yield curve compared to our fixed rate fee capture as the oppose to floating rate note fee capture, you're going to see that when the yield curve is flatter, clients are trading – and if you trade shorter dated paper you're going to see the fee capture come in a little bit. I caution because you have lots of other factors that work. And I gave the sort of rule of thumb before on what movement in yield means to what and to get much more granular and isolate that we can do it, but it's probably not telling the whole story.
Tony DeLise: And even in the short-term Patrick this month is the good example of all the different moving parts being fairly complicated to predict fee capture because while the treasury cure has flatten our fee capture is actually up due to fewer block trading programs being in the market versus what we saw earlier in the year. So there are lots of moving parts and the best we could do is we fully transparent with you on how our fee model works and report on a regular basis on how they're impacting average fee capture but it is very difficult to predict one month to the next.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Fair enough. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Allen with Rosenblatt. Your line is now open.
Chris Allen: Morning guys.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Allen: I guess, just following up on Patrick's last question and I realize you've given us a lot of color. I'm just kind of wondering if you give us any characteristic in terms of what durational profile look like this past quarter versus maybe prior peaks and prior trough, just maybe give us the kind of rule of thumb there as well. I know its been a concern for some investors in terms of moving forward that's going to revert at more normalized levels as rates revert. So if you give us any color in terms of where that's in this past quarter in prior peaks and troughs that would be very helpful?
Rick McVey: Yes. Peak and fee capture, I mentioned it a little bit earlier, but third quarter of 2010 our U.S. high-grade fee capture was at $205 per million. At that the years to mature was about nine years and the 10-year treasury yield was about 2.9 percentage point, so not much change in the 10-year yield versus where we were in the first quarter. Here's the maturity were about a year and a half longer, so that did influence fee capture when we reported the $205 per million. The other difference would have been around our fee plan where in the first quarter this year we had more trading accruing in larger trade side. But as mentioned before by far and away the biggest difference between the peak and where we are today would be a post crisis trough, but by far and away the largest impact was dealer choice on the fee plan as they were on. And just to put in perspective, if we were at 205 third quarter 2010, we just reported 154 per million in the first quarter of 2018, $51 difference, $35 per million has to do with the choice of plan that the dealers were on. And we given rule of thumb before for every dealer that moves from the variable plan to the distribution fee plan at today's volume it reduces the fee capture by about $3 per million. So if you're looking at today in about $35 per million that decline was because of the dealer choice of plan. And I'll just mention just briefly on sort of the pre-prices trough, the biggest difference on the pre-prices trough where we were down if we're just for the variable fee plan we were down at something like $128 per million. The biggest difference there was 30% of our business at that time was floating rate notes. 30%, you look at today, 5% of our business, floating rate note very short duration, the fee capture is appreciably lower, that's a big difference in fee capture, and the years to maturity were 5.5 years, and they were 7.5 years. So its different environment and again lots of moving pieces here, but today is difference than eight years ago, we reported 205 and its difference than 12 years ago when we reported something appreciably lower than where we are today.
Chris Allen: Thanks. Very helpful. My other questions have been answered. Thanks guys.
Tony DeLise: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Kyle with KBW. Your line is now open. If your phone is on mute, please unmute.
Kyle Voigt: Sorry, guys. Sorry its Kyle again. Just one more or two more on fee capture. Just given you just said on distribution fee plan, it seems to be very attractive options for most of your dealers in your platform, any desire to change the monthly fee there or to introduce more volume tiers for those distribution fees?
Tony DeLise: No. We don't really have any changes in mind, Kyle, we like more dealers on the distribution fee plan, because in our view it gives them further motivation to have more of their trading conducted electronically on market access. So we are happy with the way that plan works. I think it creates good alignment between market access and the dealers and we don't currently have any plans to change the distribution fee plan.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then, I think you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks that the other credit fee capture was impacted by changes to the Eurobond fee schedule. Can you give us a general range for that Eurobond business is shaking out in terms of fee capture and where you expect to go going forward?
Tony DeLise: Sure, Kyle. We did make some changes in effective January 1st and that is the Eurobond stake and Eurobond specifically it is competitive stake, so we did reevaluate outpricing schedules in light of the increase transparency post MiFID II, so that we have a lot more visibility on where fees are in the market, so we did make some adjustments to put us in line with the market. And as we've predicted we don't fees to be obstacle to growing our business and then we don't being obstacle to growing our Eurobond business. There is lots of momentum with European clients. You saw the numbers we posted. It was 1.9 billion a day in average daily volume, your volumes up almost 30%. So we have to remember that also that more than half of the volume from our European clients is from emerging markets in U.S. credit. So it is a diverse set of bonds that they are trading. Very specifically on where we're coming out now on fee capture and we're four months into the changes that we put in place January 1st, we're in that $110 to a $125 per million range, and even there I caution a little bit because it is maturity based. It is size-based. We have different fees for European high yields than we do for investment grade, so I do caution, but the first four months here the range been about 110 to 120 per million.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then last one I guess is could you tell us or explain again or just go over the dynamics for local EM, you're growing so rapidly in the local EM market. The growth of the entire EM product complex has been fantastic, but in local EM specifically the fee capture differential between that and the external EM capture rates? That's it from me. Thanks.
Tony DeLise: Okay. Kyle, I probably covered this on prior calls, I don't remember right now, but we have emerging market corporates and emerging market sovereigns and that will be the two big break point on fees, so typically for emerging market corporates its $400 per million and again regardless of size, regardless of majority 400 per million and then if you look at emerging market sovereign bonds including most of what we do in local markets is sovereign bond its $150 per million. And I'll tell you we are completely transparent on this. We have posted our fee schedules under the new SEF rules. It is posted on our website. So you'll see that 400 for corporates, 150 for sovereigns, that's how our fee plan works right now.
Rick McVey: And most local market trading is sovereign bonds.
Kyle Voigt: Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Rick McVey for any further remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and joining this spring and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-01-31 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - Investor Relations Rick McVey - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tony DeLise - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs Kyle Voigt - KBW Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Chris Shutler - William Blair Chris Allen - Rosenblatt
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, January 31, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter, and will provide update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain. The Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company’s future results, please see the descriptions of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31st, 2016. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us for the fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Global trading volume for the quarter was up 5%, led by record emerging markets volumes and continued growth with international plans/plants. Open trading volume also reached record level in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $99.6 million in Q4 was up 5% and pretax income was down slightly year-over-year. EPS of $0.88 was flat to last year. We believe these results on a relative basis were very strong given the extremely benign market conditions and comparative results all throughout the industry through the quarter. Based on our estimate of market volumes during the quarter, US high grade market share rose to a record 17.6%. The competitive landscape continues to be an area of interest for our investors and stock analysts, unfortunately very low consistent volume and revenue data is available from private company competitors. As a result, we believe the Greenwich Associates annual e-trading survey provides a relevant and independent review of market share trends. Their investor survey results released in Q4, confirm that our competitive position continues to get stronger with an estimated 86% electronic market share in US high grade and high yield trading.  Slide 4 highlights our full year results and continued strong growth rates. 2017 marks the 9th consecutive year of record trading volume, revenue and operating income. Full year 2017 revenue was a record $397 million, up 7.4% from 2016 and diluted EPS was record $3.89, up 16.5%. Transaction revenue for 2017 was up 6.9% year-over-year to a record $355 million as overall trading volume reached the record $1.5 trillion, up 11.4%. Three and five year results showed attractive long-term compound growth rates creating superior returns for MarketAxess shareholders.  Trailing 12 months free cash flow was $160 million. In light of our strong results and outlook for continued growth, the Board of Directors approved a 27% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share. Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. 2017 was a highly unusual year with credit spread volatility and interest rate volatility at decade lows. Credit spread also continued their one way path of tightening ending the year historically low levels. On a broader scale, the past six to seven years have been extraordinary times in global bond markets. Central Bank have injected nearly $12 trillion in new liquidity from quantitative easing into bond markets around the world, sending nearly $10 trillion in government bonds to negative yields. The impact of this Central Bank activity has led to increase inflow through US credit funds as investors search for yield. This demand is fueled record growth in corporate bond issuance with another annual record in 2017.  Over the last few quarters, we've seen sign of Central Bank's pulling back from quantitative easing, resulting in a modest increase in interest rates. We believe that higher interest rates could spur greater activity in secondary trading. The growth in the size of a global credit markets, combined with regulatory trends such as MiFID II, create a large and growing market opportunity for electronic trading and global credit.  Slide 6 shows our volume and trade account by product. Our strong year-over-year volume gain of approximately $150 billion was driven by record volume in US high grade and emerging markets. High grade volume was up $94 billion during the year, extending our lead in the space. The growth in overall trading activity was driven by share gains with existing clients, as well as the continued growth in new clients. For the full year, total active client firms grew to over 1,300 firms and all of our major products showing increase in active clients. We are especially pleased with the continued momentum in our emerging markets business. In 2017, emerging markets volume was up 37% year-over-year to a record $307 billion. Overall, across all products on the platform, the percentage of volume for international clients grew to 26% versus 22% in 2016. Client and product diversification creates a strong foundation for future growth.  Since today is the last day of trading in January, I want to give you an update on business trends to start the year. January is currently on track to be a record month for average daily trading volume at around $7 billion per day. EM growth continues to lead the way with another record month. As this typically the case, January high grade market share is below the fourth quarter average but well above last January. We will provide the final January results in a few days.  Slide 7 provides an update on open trading. Open trading average daily volume of $926 million in 2017 was up 34% year-over-year. In 2017, open trading represented 16% of the total volume traded on the platform. For the full year, we averaged 2,500 open trades per day. Liquidity takers experienced an estimated cost savings of $90 million in 2017. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.2 basis points in yield when they completed the US high grade transaction through open trading protocols. When compared to our Composite Price, realtime mid market estimate for corporate bonds, we believe that liquidity providers are achieving similar savings in transaction cost. Currently, 16% client trade run market access experienced price improvement from open trading, up from 13% in 2016. Dealer initiated open trades reached another new high of 24% of all open trading volume last year, up from 17% in 2016. Open trading is increasingly becoming an important distribution channel for dealer and their efforts to increase trading velocity and reduce balance sheet usage.  Our vast network of investors and dealers operating an open trading provides an additive pool of liquidity for both dealers and investors. In 2017, open trading accounting for 37% of US high yield volume, 16% of US high grade volume and 12% of emerging markets volume.  Now let me turn the call over to Tony for additional comments on our financial results and outlook. 
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our global volume increased 5% for the quarter while estimated our aggregated market volumes were flat. We closed out the year on a strong note with record estimated monthly market share in December for US high grade, high yield and emerging market bonds, and as Rick just mentioned, the increased trading activity has carried over into January. U.S. high-grade volumes were $201 billion for the quarter, up 9% year-over-year on a combination of higher estimated market share and a 6% increase in market volume. Volumes in the other credit category were up 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Emerging markets trading was again the standup this quarter with average daily volume of $1.3 billion, a significant uplift both sequentially and year-over-year. High yield in Eurobond trading volume were flat sequentially.  The estimated average daily total market volume across our product set is approximately $68 billion. For 2017, our average daily volume was $5.8 billion leaving to a composite estimated share of around 9%, or double the level from five years ago. And every percentage point of market share is equal to approximately $35 million in annual transaction revenue. Client engagement is increasing, there is significant room to grow market share and we are making the necessary investments to drive electronic adoption higher.  On Slide 9, we provide a summary of quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 5% and quarterly commission revenue was up 3% as we face the tough year-over-year comparable with a heighten market activity post election in 2016. You would notice that we also recast our revenue reporting to provide a clear picture of our information services and post trade businesses. Information services revenue is up 20%, principally due to new recurring data contracts. The uptick in post trade and services revenue is mainly due to MiFID II implementation fees. While the post trade services revenue has historically grown at a low single digit pace, we expect revenue growth in 2018 of more than 20%.  Operating expenses were up 14% year-over-year leading to a 2% decline in income before taxes. The effective tax rate was 32% in the fourth quarter and reflects offsetting items. We recognized $11.4 million, or $0.30 per share in excess tax benefits from share based compensation. This benefit was offset by one time tax charge of $11.7 million, or $0.31 per share to reflect the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was signed into law in December. Our diluted EPS was $0.88 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.9 million shares.  On Slide 10, we've laid our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were down 6% year-over-year as the 5% increase in trading volume was offset the impact of our new high yield fee plan and mix shift within certain products. US high grade fee capture was up slightly on a sequential basis and down $13 per million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year change reflects lower execution fees caused by two dealers shifting to the distribution fee plan, and a higher percentage of volume traded in larger size buckets. Our other credit category fee capture was down $22 on sequential basis. Approximately half of the variants was due to a full quarter impact from the new high yield fee structure implemented effective August 1st. The lower high yield transaction fees were offset by $1.6 million increase in distribution fees. We also experienced typical swings in the other credit category fee capture resulting from mix shift mainly a higher percentage of emerging markets volume in sovereign bond.  Slide 11 provides you with the expense details. Sequentially expenses increased by 1%. The most significant increase was in marketing and advertising which tends to swing period-to-period depending on the timing of campaign and events. Compensation and benefits declined $1.3 million sequentially on a lower variable incentive compensation which is tied directly to operating performance. Full year 2017 expenses of $196 million were up 10% versus 2016. Total year headcount of 429 was an increase of 46 from yearend 2016.  On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet and capital management information. Cash and investments as of December 31st were $407 million and free cash flow reached $160 million in 2017. Dividend and share repurchases including net downs and option exercises and restricted stock vesting aggregated $120 million. Our current quarterly dividend is an important element of our capital management strategy. With the announced 27% increase to $0.42, we have more than doubled the quarterly dividend rate in just the past three years. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 33,000 shares under our share buyback program. As of December 31st, approximately $94 million was available for future repurchases under this program.  On Slide 13, we have our 2018 expense capital expenditure and income tax rate guidance. We expect the total 2018 expenses will be in the range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $8 million of duplicate occupancy costs, our new corporate offices we are building out at 55 Hudson Yards in New York City. We took possession of the space in mid January and have a targeted moving date in December of this year. Excluding the duplicate occupancy cost, the midpoint in the guidance range suggest an approximate 11% year-over-year increase in expenses, which will be little higher than our growth rate over the past five years. 2018 capital expenditures are expected to range from $43 million to $50 million and include approximately $25 million to build out cost for the Hudson Yards office space.  We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2018 will range from 23% to 25%. The reduction in the US federal income tax rate is expected to reduce our effective tax rate by roughly 10 percentage points. The guidance range also incorporate an estimate for excess tax benefits on restricted stock schedule to vest in 2018 of roughly $2 million with the majority of that benefit recognized in the first quarter. The combination of the significant stock option exercises in 2017, the lower federal tax rate and other tax reform charges mean that the expected excess tax benefits in 2018 will be significantly lower than 2017.  Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. 
Rick McVey : Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the fourth quarter and full year results given the difficult trading conditions during the year. We continue to invest heavily to build valuable technology solutions for our clients to reduce transaction costs. Our global client network continues to grow and the credit markets are more focused than ever on improving trading efficiency. We are excited about the large opportunity ahead and the New Year is off to a good start.  Now I'd be happy to open the lines for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Rich Repetto: Yes. Hi, Rick. Hi, Tony. Good morning. I guess the first question is with the MiFID II, that appeared to be -- or appears to be strong catalyst for electronic trading in the European markets. And just trying to see in January and one of your peers has reported an uptick in trading but again like you said the private company comps and difficult to sort of get a clear look. But what's your experience in Europe in January? Are you getting the benefit of MiFID II in your electronic trading? 
Rick McVey : I think we are encouraged by the early signs and the growth in January volumes that outlined earlier is led by European clients. And by way of reminder, we have a broad based and diversified business with those clients in EM, US credit and Eurobond. And we believe that the reason that their trading activity up is attributable to MiFID II. And I would also say that we've seen a significant increase in phone trade processing which of course we do not include in our electronic trading volumes. But those numbers are up as well suggesting that European clients do want to get more trades on regulated venues for reporting purposes. And then as Tony mention earlier, it's also having a positive impact on our reg reporting business was tracked. And we continue to be encouraged about the development we see in our data products. 
Rich Repetto: Thank you. That helps. And then I guess one for Tony. You mentioned that the 11% midpoint expense increased year-over-year, it was a little bit higher than usual. And could you get -- expand a little bit more on where the spending and did that -- is the increase partly driven by increased cash flow from tax reform as well or just a little bit color behind that, the increase.
Tony DeLise: Sure, Rich. I'd say I think the tax reform piece of it or any benefits from tax reform really influence our plans around investing in and we are going to continue to invest. We are investing to expand the geographic reach expand the addressable market, launch new protocol, launch new products and also address what's happening on the regulatory front and just to give some color while that 11% midpoint slightly higher than the five years CAGR, a couple of items in there and I say for MiFID II and for Brexit there are discrete incremental spending upwards of $5 million that will be in the recurring run rate going forward. But that's incremental spending that will result in 2018. So that's a bit of an uplift. I'd say the second piece, you have to remember that 30% of our expenses right around 30% is denominated in -- and the functional currency is not the US dollar, so we are subject to FX swing, just as FX movement with the dollar weakening, it does add around $2 million or $3 million in year-over-year expenses. And so if you -- this isn't to make an excuse but if you were to carve out those two items, you are looking at an expense increase somewhere around 7% or 8%. But just, again not to make excuse. WE are trying to explain where the components are. 
Rich Repetto: Got it. And just one last quick one. You gave the tax rate guidance for the year that's very helpful. But you said like the first quarter can be more volatile I would assume because of the stock vesting. Any help on first quarter sort of a range for the effective tax rate in the first quarter? 
Tony DeLise: Yes. So, Rich, in those prepared remarks I had said the tax benefit right now and again you have to realize they were -- we are making estimate based on what we expect to vest based on where the share price will be. But what we are seeing right now that the excess tax benefits in 2018 would be somewhere around $2 million and most of that will occur in the first quarter. Actually most of it occurs today to be quite frank about. So most of that additional tax benefit will happen in the first quarter. And just rough numbers that we are guiding to a midpoint of 24%, you might see something like 21% in the first quarter and then 25% in Q3 and Q4. So it's not going to swing that much. So it will look a bit lower in the first quarter. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Conor Fitzgerald: Hi, good morning. Just want to get a little bit an update on the response you are seeing from some of the price changes around high yield in Europe that you made in the back half of last year and see if client behavior is changing any back of it. 
Rick McVey : Sure. On high yield the changes went through in August and we believe it's fair and scalable fee model for all market participants on our system. Quite honestly I think the flatness in high yield share is had a lot more to do with the benign market environment, the lack of volatility than anything else. And you did see that we put up a record high yield market share number in December, as well Tony picks up we are optimistic that we have a unique liquidity pool that serves the needs of our clients. And I think it will be important to watch the trends over the coming months and quarters to make sure that we are benefiting from the changes that we have made. So we think we are on the right track there and we are in early days of those high yield fee changes. 
Conor Fitzgerald: And did you have to tweak your presence schedule at all with MiFID or is that the same it was in 4Q? 
Rick McVey : I think everyone is going through the exercise of making sure that everything is standardized as required by the MTF regulations and we did make a few changes to standardize the fee schedules and make sure that they are consistent with those new regulations. There is a also a lot of moving parts in terms of what will be included in MTFTs as more is disclosed and there maybe some modest modifications coming in the industry and that could include us. It's -- we are really analyzing things as we go. 
Conor Fitzgerald: That's helpful color. Thanks. And then Tony just one for you. Nice to see the dividend increased today. Just want to ask on capital flexibility if the right opportunity came across just want your updated thoughts on how much leverage you think your business could carry for short period of time if there was an M&A opportunity that you are interested in? 
Tony DeLise: It's a good question, Conor. Because we -- there is no secret that we have the fair amount of cash and securities sitting on the balance sheet. And year end it was right around $405 million. And we don't need $405 million to run the business. So when we look at the money we need for regulatory and working capital purposes, we do have excess capital earmarked for -- to support open trading. So we have excess capital in our regulated entity. There is still a fair amount of excess cash on the balance sheet. We could use upward of around $200 million of our cash and securities if the right opportunity came along. We don't have any leverage on today. We just posted the year where EBITDA was north of $250 million. So we have a fair amount of leverage that we could put on the company. So if the right opportunity comes along we have the flexibility and we can act opportunistically that way. And it would be 2x or 3x or 4x EBITDA will be the type of leverage that we put on comfortably. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. First one I guess just on the Thompson transaction with Blackstone just curious to get your thoughts on the transaction. How it could potentially impact the competitive environment with Tradeweb? And then just more broadly maybe a follow up to kind of Conor's question about maybe you could help us understand your interest in potentially acquiring to other asset classes outside of cash corporate bonds if there are assets for sale? Seems like in the past you've been kind of just of the view that there is such long run rate here that is important to kind of focus your energy on a core bond space? 
Rick McVey : Sure. On the first question, the news was new to us, yesterday along with most everyone else we spoken to so all we've done, Kyle, is read the same media reports and press release that you have. It would appear from what we know that Tradeweb will be included in the assets that Blackstone is investing in. And that creates an additional owner of Tradeweb as well as all the other TR financial assets in Blackstone. TR by all appearances will stay involved with the meaningful equity stake. So it's too early to really predict or even speculate on what changes may come. At face value we do not see any significant difference there in the competitive landscape. And on your second question in terms of M&A. Clearly, we've been growing organically in many products beyond corporate bond. And our interests are well beyond corporate. I would say we believe our competitive advantage is in credit and the credit opportunity is very significant and we think we've served our shareholder extremely well to focus on organic growth. We started another year with that as our primary focus. But there are assets within the credit market that could be complimentary either in clients or products or regions to help us expand inorganically and we would be very interested in anything that fits with that long term vision.
Kyle Voigt: All right, thank you. And then second one just on the market share. I think you said above January of last year in high grade but below 4Q level for high grade specifically. Any color on high yield and EM and how that is tracking versus 4Q levels? 
Rick McVey : I think with the ADD numbers that I outlined earlier, it's safe to assume that we've seen broad based growth across products. And we'll have as we always do a full detail on our January monthly result out in a few days across every product but as I mentioned we are really encouraged by the start to the year. And these are trading volumes that we have never seen before. And we are optimistic that between the slight increase that we are seeing in market volatility and the regulatory trends that the outlook for ongoing growth is very positive. 
Kyle Voigt: Great. And then last for me just a follow up on the fees per million. Just the other credit fees per million I think are a little bit lower than we expected. I mean high grade was a big higher. Tony just on the high yield product specifically, did that come in where you expected? I think you are guiding towards around $350 per million or did it come in a bit below that on high yield side? And just trying to think about how we should run rate that going forward. 
Tony DeLise: Yes. Kyle, you came in literally spot on with that number. So what we've seen post August first implementation of the new fees schedule that those high yield fees are right around $350 per million. Now realize that when you look at high yield we have high yield that trade on price, high yield that trade on spread, , we have all been trading so we have different fee plans or structures working across that. So there could be some swings but we are seven months into this or five months into this and it's all been around $350 per million. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So, Rick, you mentioned trade spotting and how you guys had some traction with that. Is that something where trade spotting for voice trade, if you do it you kind of brings people into market access ecosystem and that leads to more electronic execution over time or is that in your view kind of the completely discrete type of activity?
Rick McVey : Well, to be specific Patrick I mentioned foreign trade capture. And so these are trades conducted bilaterally by phone or their communication mechanisms between clients and dealers the trade off system. And then one or both parties won that trade processed on system. And so we believe that this is a post trade activity that's obviously not in electronic trade and the platform. But it's an ancillary service for clients obviously carry very low with any fees. So it's a service but it does help our clients to increase their efficiency and accuracy at trade reporting. Of course, we are attracted to those clients staying on the system for more of their activity throughout the day.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. Thanks for that clarification. And then as we think about your investment initiatives for 2018 and where you are going to be investing your technology? I think there are a few things you've talked in the past. One is retail pricing functionality, having streaming quotes; another one is maybe having some sort of auction process throughout the day. What's your most updated thinking on where that spending goes in 2018?
Rick McVey : Sure. We got four or five different priorities and I don't think any of them will come as a surprise to you. First, as we mentioned over the last two or three quarters, we are really encouraged by the momentum that we have in global or emerging markets trading. And that is a vast market that requires investments because we have created a comprehensive trading solution and market place for our clients that includes hard currency, sovereign debt trading, EM corporate bond trading and increasingly EM local market trading with about 25 or 26 local markets available for trading. So one of the investments is to continue to expand EM product offering, while at the same time increasing sales resources to attract more EM local market dealers to the platform and more EM clients around the world. And international client diversification is a key priority for us. So a disproportionate of those sales resources will continue to go into Europe and Asia and Latin America to really take advantage of what we see as a very large and growing EM product opportunity. Within our credit businesses, we are also encouraged by what we see in the investor and dealer desire to continue to increase trading efficiency. And one of the ways that we are helping with that is to invest in auto execution which we rolled out in Q4 in Europe and we are in the process of rolling out now in the US. For small trades this allows investors to execute electronically with absolutely no manual labor whatsoever. So another way that we can further increases their efficiency. And as you mentioned in retail, as we look at that space, we are encouraged by the liquidity pool that we have for micro lot trading, and we do believe that they can be extended further into the retail client segment with the combination of some modest investments in technology to fit with retail and client trading activity, as well as sales resources to focus on the retail wealth advisors and brokers. So something those are so many areas but it's a full agenda. And we are pretty excited about the return on investment that we are seeing currently. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it, very helpful, thank you. And then one for you Tony. And you probably are going to groan when I ask this. But now that we have kind of 2018 OpEx guidance just initial thoughts on 2018. And I think specifically for your occupancy line. Do we basically just think of it as the $8 million from your new headquarters stays in and then what you are currently paying for your existing headquarters rolls off? 
Tony DeLise: That saying -- how can I groan, Patrick? You are asking about 2019. Its outside, it's clear it's possible on that. So you have to remember its part of this. Today, we lease about 55,000 square feet in three separate locations here in New York and what we are doing with Hudson Yards, we are taking on 83,000 square feet and the rent expense of per square foot cost for Hudson Yards is right around 50% high. So there will be an uplift, there will be an uplift in rent expense. Now trying to be as clear as I can, if you are taking the GAAP numbers for this year and last year occupancy cost wee around $6 million. If I am telling you that the duplicate rent is about $8 million that means this year for 2018 you should probably modeling something close to $14 million for occupancy cost. And when the new space comes online fully and we exit 299 Park 10 floor, 299 Park 12 floor, 560 Lexington, you can expect those occupancy cost to come down around $3 million. So $6 million last year to up to $14 million down to $11 million for 2019. That's about as clear as I can get. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris Shutler: Hey, guys, good morning. Regarding progress on larger trade sizes, can you give us the block percentage in the quarter and maybe just can you quantify in some way the progress you've made on the work up functionality or [Indiscernible] matching. Thanks.
Rick McVey : Sure. I think that as we look at our share gain last year in high grade most of it came from larger trade sizes both $1 million to $5 million and $5 million and up. So around 70% of our volume in US high grade comes from $1 million and up trade sizes and about 23% of our volume comes from $5 million and up. So increasingly the share gains are coming larger trade. I think I am right in saying that we are running around 9.5% or so what we see in trades block trades for high grade. So there is definitely progress there in terms of clients getting more comfortable especially with liquid bonds, trading larger ticket sizes on the platform. Now I point out two things. One, we are having some success with work up and sometimes that starts with a $2 million trade-in and ends with a series of trades that add up to something more meaningful in the block trading category through open trading. The other example I would give Chris is in emerging markets trading during the course of last year we introduced a request for market protocol for two way responses in EM local markets and we've seen very fast pickup of block trading in EM local markets through that protocol. So we will continue to invest to deliver technology solution that really fit for both investors and dealers to continue to do more large trade sizes on the system. 
Chris Shutler: All right, thanks, Rick. And then just one more, you talked about the -- you are seeing really strong growth in emerging markets. Is more of that growth being driven by existing clients or trading more or is it being driven more by addition of new client. I know it's a combination of both but just trying to figure out what's the more important driver historically and what will be the more important driver over the next couple of years? 
Rick McVey : I honestly not sure we have the exact number but you are exactly right it has been both. We've taken on a lot of new clients in EM over the last 12 months globally. And I will tell you that there is a disproportionate share of last year of our EM growth that came from international clients in Europe and Asia, which is why we are increasing our resources there. Those new clients have been incredibly important to our EM growth. The existing clients were prior to 2017 were primarily in the US and their volume are up. But if you looked at last year the growth of newly international clients I think would be the distinguishing feature for the year. And we have reasonable estimates on EM market size given the numbers that we can see from trace EM corporate bond reporting but importantly our tracks database in London and as much as we've grown over the last two or three years in EM, we estimate that we are around 9% of the market opportunity currently. So with client adoption really heating up and our investment in both protocols and sales to attract new and onboard new clients, we are really encouraged that this could be a long-term growth opportunity for the company. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is a follow up from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Rich Repetto: Yes, Hey, Rick, just a little tries to learn from your experience in the fixed income market. But you look historically your market share in December a lot of time; most of the times are highest of the year. And it comes down in January. Could you explain a little bit of color behind that? I know we can look at issuance and we can look at the trade size and block but can you give us a little bit deeper inside on why that happens and I guess what we could expect this year? I know you gave the range, some of the range is already but what's really going on? What's the market catalyst for this to happen all the time? 
Rick McVey : Well, first of all thank you for that question because I think December and January results create a really interesting story of what's really going on in the fixed income markets and why it's extremely difficult to measure trends in electronic trading on market access on monthly basis. Because you are absolutely right we set new records in estimated market share in high grade, high yield and EM in the month of December. But obviously it's a month where market volumes are significantly lighter. And the distinguishing feature is there December as you would expect given the holiday environment is typically one of the lightest months for new issue activity and it is also a month where investors have a lot of yearend portfolio rebalancing to conduct and tax trading. So there is more secondary activity leading into yearend around those rebalances. And when new issues are very high which they are in typically in January and they have been again this year. You see the focus go to the underwriters, that new issue bond trade very actively in the first week or two. Market protocol currently is that that new issue trade generally gets done through the underwriters and the block trading percentage of trace goes up. So if you look at the last two months in December you will see that the block trading percentage or trace was at the low end of the range around 40%. If you fast forward to January, you will see it's up around 46% or 47%, that is reflective of the difference in the new issue calendar and all of the activity in trading those new issues in block size with the underwriters for the first week or two. Now if you ask us which we do prefer, clearly, we like January better than we do December even though our share numbers are lower because market activity is much higher which is driving record trading volumes for the company. So what we do know is if you set back and you look at quarters or years, it is clear to see that there is secular trend going on for greater electronics trading and global credit. And I think that we are highly optimistic that that trend will continue but it's impossible to measure those trends month to month. I can promise you that the fact that our January share is lower than December has nothing to do with client behavior changing and how they feel about market access. It has all do to with what's in trace. And that's what make it really, really difficult to measure market share changes month to month and then we all have to step back and look at them in a longer term basis. 
Rich Repetto: Got it, very, very helpful. And just other last quick thing on I guess market share but from what I understood you saying earlier to my first question is that the way you had experienced the benefits or one way you experienced the benefits of MiFID II would be through European clients trading EM in the EM market. And so do imply that's what you are seeing in January. Do I have that picture right? Is there any way you can sort of ballpark quantify that because again I think people are excited about the opportunity that's been produced, that seems like occurring in Europe with this regulatory change. 
Rick McVey : Yes. Yes. So as you know our European business yield, you'll see an active contribution across products. And I think it's a mistake to view euros in isolation because our business is diversified with EM, US credit and euros, and we are seeing that behavior will change in the first month of January. It's hard to know exactly what MiFID II is and what part is because the market environment is a bit better starting the year than it has been in the fourth quarter and during 2017. But when we look in January year-over-year, our European client activity across products is up about 35%. So we are encouraged by the start to the year with European client activity. And the fact that it does look like the regulatory changes are causing a behavioral shift in electronic trading activity. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Allen with Rosenblatt. Your line is now open.
Chris Allen: Good morning, guys. Just had a quick one on the info services one. I apologize if I miss this. Fee now is up 20% due to new occurring revenue contracts. I was wondering if you could give us any color just in terms of the type of client purchasing those contracts and what is the pipeline look for that going forward. 
Tony DeLise : So, Chris, we -- you saw that we ended up breaking out the info services line and historically that info services business has been growing at about 10% per year. And within that category it's our bond pick or data service we have volume and pricing reports. We have -- are access all products, there is reference data, so there is a variety of product in that line. The past two years now we've had new recurring data contracts $4 million or higher each year. So we do expect growth going forward. It's a combination of broker dealer, investment managers; it's a pretty broad based client group there. 
Operator: Thank you. And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for any further remarks. 
Rick McVey : Thank you for joining us this morning. And we look forward to catching up with all of you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-10-25 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - Investor Relations Rick McVey - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tony DeLise - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs Chris Shutler - William Blair Kyle Voigt - KBW Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, October 25th, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter, and will provide update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain. The Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company’s future results, please see the descriptions of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31st, 2016. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And, thank you for joining us for the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Our earnings report this morning reflects a solid quarter in a trading environment remained challenging. Third quarter trading volumes of $347 billion were up 8% year-over-year. International client volume increased by 24% to $89 billion, and our emerging market product area experienced continued momentum with a 22% increase in trading volume. Open trading set a new record this quarter in client participation. Revenues for the third quarter were up 7% to $97 million. Expenses of $49.5 were up 13% due to ongoing investments in our business and expenses related to global regulatory changes. Diluted EPS of $0.90 was up 10%. Third quarter U.S. high-grade estimated market share TRACE increased to 17.2% from 16%. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. In the third quarter credit spreads continue to trend lower and spread volatility remained at historically low levels. U.S. credit inflows continue to be very strong due to global investor demand for yield. Like other credit market participants very low market volatility coupled with investors chasing scares fund create the difficult trading environment for our business. In like these market conditions we believe our business performed well during the quarter. Overall TRACE high-grade market volumes in Q3 were relatively flat year-on-year, while high-yield TRACE volumes were down to 7%. The lack of volatility in high-yield has led fewer trading opportunities for alternative market makers and EPS relative value players, both important client segments for our high-yield trading business. New issue activity remained strong as issuers refund to strong demand at historically low corporate bond yields. The combination of low market volatility and high new issuance increases investor focus on the new issue calendar. Slide five provides an update on open trading. Open trading volumes were $56 billion in the third quarter with average daily volume up 29% from the same period last year. Approximately 155,000 open trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up 45% from 106,000 in Q3 2016. Liquidity providers or price makers on the platform drove a 51% increase in price responses in the third quarter. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $21 million in transaction costs through open trading on the system. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.1 basis points in yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through open trade protocols. When compared to our composite price, real-time midmarket estimated for corporate bonds, we believe the liquidity providers are achieving similar savings in transaction costs. Dealer initiated open trades reached a new high of 24% of all open trading volume in the quarter. Open trading is increasingly becoming an important distribution channel for dealers and their efforts to increase trading velocity and reduce balance sheet usage. Our vast network of investors and dealers operating an open trading provide an additive tool of liquidity for dealers to move bonds. In the third quarter, open trading accounted 37% U.S. high-yield volume, 15% U.S. high-grade volume, and 13% of emerging market volume. Slide six provides an update on our international progress. International client volumes were up 24% year-over-year driven by a 26% increase in the number of active clients to over 600 firms. All four of our core products continue to show solid growth in active trading clients. Emerging markets activity was especially strong during the quarter. Overall EM volume with international clients was up 38% and local market volumes were up 22%. We had approximately 900 firms globally trading EM during the quarter. We are encouraged by the momentum we see in EM in spite of benign market conditions. Our preparations for MiFID II are on schedule and we have reached multiple milestones to support our clients in meeting their regulatory obligations. MarketAxess [indiscernible] tracks has been granted approval by the U.K. FCA to operators in APA for trade publishing and as in ARM for transaction reporting. MarketAxess results are recently approved by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to operate as an RMO. This normally demonstrates our continued invest in the region, but also addresses clients demand by providing a new trading platform with a regulatory structure that meets the needs of our clients in Asia prior to MiFID II implementation. We expect the MiFID II reporting, transparency, and best execution obligations to drive greater demand for electronic trading and market data solutions. We have made significant investments in all three areas to help our clients with the upcoming regulatory changes. Now let me the call over to Tony for more detail on our financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 7 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our global volume increased 8% in spite of the continued lackluster market environment. Global trading volumes passed $1 trillion on a year-to-date basis, up $132 billion year-over-year. U.S. high-grade volumes were $201 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in estimated market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 9%, while estimated aggregate market volumes for emerging market, high-yield, and Eurobond was down 5% year-over- year. There has been a fairly consistent pattern over the past three quarters with strong growth in emerging markets trading on our platform and lower than average growth in high-yield in Eurobonds. For the first time municipal bonds trade in the platform exceeded $1 billion in the quarter and over 50% of the trading volume was through open trading. Recent news cap like on Micro Lot trading in U.S. high-grade bonds. Our trading volume and market share in Micro Lot has grown significantly over the past five years. Our estimated market share trading volume under 250,000 in trade side was 23% compared to the aggregate of all retail APS trading platforms of 21%. With five important trading days remaining in the month, high-grade and high yield market share are tracking below third quarter levels. Well, overall average daily volume is tracking similar to the third quarter. On slide 8, we provided summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Quarterly commission revenue and overall revenue were up 6% increase and 7% consecutively and are fairly consistent with the overall growth in trading volume. Information and post-trade services revenue increased by 14% driven by higher data revenue. Operating expenses were 13% year-over-year leading to a 2% increase and income before taxes. The effective tax rate was 28% in the third quarter and reflects excess tax deductions of approximately $3.8 million relating to the new standard for share-based compensation accounting adopted effective January 1st, 2017. The full year effective tax rate is trending towards the lower end of our 26% to 28% guidance range. The discussions around tax reform heated up, now it’s half the budget, while it’s too early to speculate on the outcome at 2017 earnings level and business mix. We estimate that a 10% point reduction in the U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate would increase EPS by approximately $0.40 and drop the effective tax rate by 7% point. Our diluted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter on a stable diluted share count of 38 million shares. On Slide 9, we’ve laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 2% year-over-year as 8% increase in trading volume was offset by a mix shift and the impact of our new high-yield fee plan. U.S. high-grade fee capture was up $7 per million on a sequential basis maybe due to a roughly half year increase in years to make sure the on bonds traded over the platform. The percentage of volume in our tiered size bucket did very much in the second quarter. Our other credit category fee capture was down $22 on the sequential basis. In addition to the typical swings and fee capture was only resulting from fee mix among products and protocol. The third quarter other credit fee per million also reflects the impact of the new high-yield fee structure implemented effective August 1st. At this time we have 10 dealers participating in the distribution fee plan which amounts to $1.5 million in monthly distribution fees. And, the variable transaction fee per million for all high-yield bond trading post implementation has been roughly $350. We expect fourth quarter distribution fee to be approximately $1.5 million higher than the third quarter. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially expenses increased by 4% as higher compensation and consulting fee mainly associated with various regulatory related initiatives embraced, a loan of non-recurring lease cost were offset by a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses. September year-to-date expenses were up 8% and full year 2017 expenses are expected to land in the lower half of our original guidance range of $192 million to $208 million. Overall headcount is tracking close to our original plan and is up 44 from year end 2016 level. The majority of the expense variance versus the midpoint of our guidance range, results from lower than anticipated variable incentive compensation. On Slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Tax and investments, as of September 30th, were $376 million and trailing 12 months free cash flow with approximately $147 million. During the quarter we pay quarterly cash dividend of $12 million and repurchased 64,000 shares also at a cost of $12 million. In September, the existing share repurchase program was terminated and our board approved a new $100 million program. Repurchases under the new program began on October 2nd. Consistent with the prior plan, the primary intention of the new repurchase program is to offset dilution from employee equity grants. Facing the third quarter results, our board has approved a $.33 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. In spite of extremely difficult trading conditions, we are pleased with the growth we are seeing in many aspects of our business. We are investing more than ever in technology solutions for our clients to meet their regulatory and trading needs. The future opportunity in electronic trading for credit markets remains large and our competitive position has never been stronger. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And, our first question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning guys.
Rick McVey: Good morning Patrick.
Tony DeLise: Good morning.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So, with yesterday’s news of BondPoint selling to ICE for $400 million. How do we evaluate the competitive threat that ICE would pose at some point in the future? And, do you see is there any difference from when Tradeweb acquired BondDesk in 2013?
Rick McVey: Thanks, Patrick. Today the retail segment has largely remained separate and apart from the institutional business that we operate and we don’t really see any changes to that dynamic. And, our Tradeweb acquisition of BondDesk four-five years ago as an example of where that business to this day remains largely retail business without much intersection into the institutional business. We have great respect for Japanese team at ISE and what they have been able to accomplish and we are sure that they’ve been thoughtful about the acquisition. I think our calculation in thought process for a variety of reasons was a little bit different and as Tony pointed we are very active in that segment of the market already and our share has been growing very rapidly in $250,000 under trade sizes. And, when we look at it today, our share of those trade sizes is greater than all of other retail ATS systems in the aggregate. And, what probably is less well known is that all of the retail market participants are now active on the MarketAxess System. The retail liquidity providers have been here for a long time given the Micro Lot institutional trading opportunities that we create for them and increasing the retail brokerage firms and wealth advisors are finding us. And, so a component of that business that’s been growing in 250 and it’s coming from retail market participants. And, in our view we continue to believe there are three key things to driving a successful marketplace, the liquidity providers in the vast network of available liquidity, order flow from liquidity takers, and technology. And, we feel very comfortable with our assets in that phase and the one change that we would need to make to have a more focused effort on retail is really on providing responses through streaming prices as opposed to our queue today. But we are very comfortable with where we sit in that part of the market and the beauty of our platform is that there are no boundaries, and we do see an increasing presence with retail clients on the MarketAxess System.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All right, thanks, it’s very helpful. And, then as a follow up to that. If we were to see more competition in the institutional space, what would, I guess, concern you more, would it be - somebody entered with an aggressive pricing strategy if somebody had new trading protocols, is there anything out there that somebody can do that, you would say, hey, this would really kind of concern us and it would look different from everything we’ve seen in the past?
Rick McVey: Well, I think we’ve seen a lot Patrick as you know, you’ve been following us for many years, but we’ve seen various competitors come with new pricing schedules including zero pricing in some cases, we’ve seen them come with new protocols and new approaches, but what has proven to be the case through time is that our 17 years of very heavy investment in building our technology platform with a variety of trading protocols relevant to institutional investors. And, building the broadest network of liquidity providers and clients on our system has made it difficult for new entrance to come in to the space. And, there is no sign of that changing, I think all the competitive data that we picked up again during the third quarter demonstrates that we continue to be the strongest E-trading platform in credit markets and that our growth rates are extending that lead. And, I think what we worry is that we were not investing, if we were standing still and hoping to maintain our share based on what we have done in the past, I think that would be an enormous mistake. The reality is we’re investing more than anyone in the space by a wide margin. So, we continue to add client segments, we continue to add new products to our trade systems, we include, we continue to add new trading protocols. And, importantly we are investing very heavily in data tool for our clients. And, to me that investment is what gives me confidence, so we can continue to extend our competitive lead.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All right, thanks very much. I’ll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. And, our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Conor Fitzgerald:
Rick McVey: Good morning.
Conor Fitzgerald: I just want to circle up on BondPoint again. And, I guess, I appreciate your comments on your thought process on the deal was a little different, maybe just a two part on that. Can you talk about some of the matrix that you look at when you consider M&A more broadly? And, then for this deal specifically to discuss the scenario where it made sense to kind of go beyond some of those matrix given, could have been an opportunity to keep the competitor at bay?
Rick McVey: Well sure, I’m happy to answer both of those. I think as you would expect, we are very interested in acquisitions they are going to add important clients to our platform or new product capabilities or new geographies. This deal really didn’t do any of those as I mentioned the retail clients are already on the MarketAxess System and we have the largest share of 250,000 an under trade sizes today. So, our calculation on this one was that this is a very modest add in terms of earnings accretion for our shareholders in a very full price. And, we think as we have in the past in this case by investing a bit more in technology in sales focused organically, we can achieve much better earnings accretion for our shareholders at a much lower cost. But we are playing a long game here, we think about where we want to be 5 or 10 years from now. We are wide open to acquisitions and anything that would really add technology products or clients to our trading systems that would be beneficial to our shareholders is something that we are - we continue to be very interested in. As we mentioned in the past, we don’t restrict ourselves to trading acquisition dealer, data analytics, and post trade services are also valuable to us. So, I think those are the kind of things that we think about as we look at potential acquisitions.
Conor Fitzgerald: That’s helpful. Thanks. And, then just want to get your updated thoughts on building your own retail trading platform, now the BondPoint off the market?
Rick McVey: Well, sure, like I said, we had a tremendous amount of focused effort. We’ve been gaining a lot of attraction in retail. And, we’re happy to put together more specific numbers, but the retail liquidity providers and increasingly the wealth advisors and retail brokerage firms are important part of the daily trade that takes place on MarketAxess, and that is why you see our share of 250,000 an under larger than anyone else by a wide margin. What we would need to do to compete directly with the retail ATS businesses is to convert what is now an institutional protocol which is highly competitive RFQ into a price stage for above which is a pretty straightforward change and add a bit more sales focused in terms of convincing retail market participants to take advantage of the pricing that’s on our system. And, the reason that we have the largest share in the $250,000 an under trade segment is because we have the best places in that space and that is why the most price competitive clients in the world use MarketAxess for micro lots and I am highly confidence as we focus more on this we have an organic opportunity to continue to expand our retail business.
Conor Fitzgerald: Got it, that’s helpful. Thanks. And, then Tony just one for you on the balance sheet, you’ve always operated with a very clean balance sheet cash rich, partly I think that’s been because M&A opportunities can come off from time-to-time, any thoughts on changing your leverage position now that one potential opportunities and [indiscernible]?
Tony Delise: Really no change in the thought around the balance sheet, we’ve always had the philosophy of having a strong balance sheet, we like the operating flexibility, it gives us the opportunity to act, opportunistically if there is some activity around M&A or around share repurchases, really no change in the thought around what we are doing with the capital returns around, the dividend. We’ve been targeting about 1/3 pay out of free cash flow in earnings. We have increased that dividend 400% since we launched it in 2019 [ph] it kept pace with the increase in earnings and increase in free cash flow. And, on the repurchase side has been, we’ve had a stated policies having a repurchase plan in place we like that repurchase plan and for the primary repurchase right now offsets delusion from equity TRACE, we are going to stay the course on that. So, really no plans, but we do have - we have the flexibility to change that. But today it’s a bit status flow on the capital policy and it’s a little bit jump right now, yes, I think if there was something to do in the retail space right now, we would have leverage on, and it wouldn’t have been an unusual amount of leverage to put on the balance sheet, but that would have been an event that would have made us add the leverage on to the balance sheet.
Rick McVey: Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And, our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys, good morning. On open trading - open trading has been 15% or so of high-grade volume now for four consecutive quarters, just talk about why you think of that has slowed and I know markets are very tough right now volatility, but I guess I’m particularly interested in how the market environments impacts the ratio of open trading as a percentage of total high-grade volume?
Rick McVey: We are happy with the growing participation that we see in open trading, but there is no doubt that the market environment has an impact on those growth rates as it does for our overall business. And, I think when the time was out for open trading is going to really show its value to our clients as we move from an environment that is heavily one way with investors looking to add bonds especially in U.S. credit to a two way market where investors and dealers are both looking for alternative sources of liquidity. And, this is far from a normal secondary market environment that we are dealing in right now. But when we see the participation numbers continue to grow for both dealers and investors in open trading, we think we’re positioning the business very well for the future in terms of being an extremely valuable source of liquidity when the market conditions change.
Chris Shutler: Okay, great. And, then on the global regulatory changes that you guys talked about MiFID and everything, the expenses; can you maybe quantify what you’re occurring this year and what the next year can be higher or lower, and then in any sense from a revenue perspective or an opportunity perspective just, how you may benefit, I know you talked to quantify at this point, but any broad sense?
Tony DeLise: Yes, Chris, I’ll give you some sense on the expense side and then we’ll have Rick cover a little bit on the revenue side. We are occurring additional expenses this year, this is not only what you see in the professional consulting line, what you saw that in the third quarter, the majority of that uplift year-over-year professional consulting and the majority of the uplift from the second quarter to third quarter had to do with planning on MiFID II embraced it and establishing new trading venues and other jurisdictions and responding to all these real changes, but there was an additional expenses this quarter in particular, we expect some of the expenses to recur, some of them are non recurring, but chunk of that will recur. And, other piece which is more technology related, we’ve had to do some things to respond to the evolving regulation that has become Arm and APA register and it’s somewhere around $4.5 million this year that we have incurred this has been capitalized once MiFID II goes live, we will start to amortizing those costs over a three year period, but that’s another addition to the - the item that hit the expense line, you’re also seeing about $4 million-$4.5 million in capitalized costs as well, some of that can recur, some of that will - as the landscape changes here, we registered more jurisdictions and we are meeting clients need across the globe, you will see an increase in expenses like that.
Rick McVey: On the revenue side Chris, I think we are well advantage or well position to take the advantage of the changes taking place primarily through MiFID II, first of course our track status business should benefit from the increase in regulatory reporting obligations for both dealers and investors and given the clients option of tractions, the reporting mechanism, we do anticipate the reporting revenues will be higher beginning in January of next year. Secondly our data products are doing well and a lot of that generates from tracks data products and its clients are really required to think more specifically about that execution and transaction costs data and the critical component of that analysis. And, then finally on the trading side, clearly their advantage is for investors and dealers to trade on regulated trading venues built into MiFID II, and we would continue to expect that our trading activity will grow on a regulated trading venues, and we think we are already seeing signs of that as our growth rates in trading volume with European clients are currently outpacing growth rates elsewhere in the world. So, we really think we will benefit from all three sides of our business from an increase in electronic trading adoption from growing regulatory reporting revenue and then from a bigger base of revenue coming out of our data products.
Chris Shutler: Okay, thanks. And, one last one on the high-grade fee rates Tony, it looks like October quarter today that the volumes are little more tilted to larger bonds, so is high-grade fee capture turning down a little from Q3 levels so far in the quarter?
Tony Delise: As much as I would like to tell you, this day-to-day and month-to-month with the high-grade fee capture, it looks like even our overall fee capture looks like, we are typically not providing that level of granularity, you are right that when you look at trades volume for this month in October, the larger trade sizes have picked up a little bit. But Chris I’ll tell you one thing on fee capture one thing to be defensive about going forward is if you look at that other credit category you just remember that we didn’t have the full set of the high-yield fee plan selected in third quarter. So, you will see often being equal, you would expect the other credit fee capture to go down to fourth quarter. So, just be cautious, just be cautious of the balance. And, outline that they - you have to bit of a flip between distribution fees and variable transaction fees, and I don’t know high-yield plan is actually today’s volume level is actually mildly accreted. So, it’s a bit of geography which just sent to that fee capture line of another credit.
Chris Shutler: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Thank you. And, our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Just I guess a follow up on MiFID II, you just outlined that could accelerate electronic verification in the market. You believe that’s going to accelerate electronic verification in the market. But in the quarter we saw MarketAxess in other trading platforms in Europe addressed to letter to ESMO [ph] then MiFID II could drive business away from Europe. I’m just trying to understand if you could - or you could help us understand this dynamic or its potential risk?
Rick McVey: Sure. Our concern is that the regulatory reporting requirements are so onerous that any client that does not need to be captured within the MiFID II environment will choose to operate outside of it. And, you see some signs of that already with client segments that are not directly in the EU. So, I think that’s a view that we had set out, I don’t think it necessarily changes the amount of trading that clients will do within European fixed income or emerging markets which are very active within the European region, but any client can avoid the obligations that are built into MiFID II is working pretty hard right now to do so. And, the point of letters, the reporting obligations in our thing, our acceptance, trade-by-trade reporting requirement is 75 PLs [ph] is something that we have never seen and we are working very hard to tracks to make that easiest possible for our customers. But I think anyone would acknowledge that, that is a significant burden for institutional investors that have thousands of transactions for day in many cases.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And, then, I guess one more on MiFID, just adding color on what you’re seeing in terms of changing behaviors at this point from MiFID II, I know you said Europe growth is outpacing the U.S. growth, but are you having discussions with some of these global asset managers out there entire business including the U.S. or is this really going to be isolated to the European business in your view with kind of the U.S. trying to stay out of - a lot of these regulations?
Rick McVey: That’s an open question right and I think global asset managers are grappling with that right now, if they run a global portfolio and unfortunately it’s in Europe, do they need to adopt MiFID II standards for the entire portfolio or just for the component that’s in the Europe? And, I think every firm has a slightly different view and opinion on that. But I think it’s safe to say it’s having implication beyond just Europe. The primary areas we are focused right now, is not an area we deal directly - the whole area about dealer research. So, there is a ripple effect going on beyond Europe. Most of the activities that were involved within Europe as clients get ready to comply with the new reporting requirements, the new best set requirements and fulfill all of their obligations that are built into MiFID II.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Just one more for me, really there is a recent article in the journal written regarding the increases of ALGOS and automated trading by dealers in the U.S. corporate debt markets. I think this is an opportunity that you mentioned in the past, but just wondering what the impact could be to your business, are you seeing increased adoption of ALGOS by dealers in your platform, and just wondering if you think this could increased hit rates in your platform overtime?
Rick McVey: We have - it’s part of the growing success that we are having small tick sizes is that the growth in ALGOS is significantly increasing, the price responses for smaller trades. And, most of that activity that is fully electronic from the ALGOS is 500,000 an under trade sizes in corporate bonds. But we’ve definitely seen an increase number of ALGOS that are live and that work on the MarketAxess System and we are aware more that are coming, and I think it’s very positive development for the small ticket business and corporate bonds because the clients will see more pricing and more competition on the back of those investments.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And, our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Yes. Hi guys. I don’t think your operator likes me, but anyway. So, my first question is, Ricky talked about in this other credit that emerging markets, the growth has outpaced high-yield in Eurobonds and certainly that’s the case year-over-year. But if you look more recently it’s probably a lot more mix. So, I guess, if you could, I don’t know whether there is any different any insight you can add to the growth rates in that bucket, the other credit bucket between high-yield emerging markets in Eurobonds like, what’s going on there that cause, now emerging markets looks like it’s dropping off quarter-over-quarter and so forth?
Rick McVey: You mean the growth rate is slowing is your point Rich is not dropping off?
Rich Repetto: Yes.
Rick McVey: You mean the growth rate is slowing?
Rich Repetto: Yes.
Rick McVey: I think relative to anything you see in the trades, any growth right now is good growth; it’s not a normal environment by any means. And, I think you can look back at previous periods and see when credit spread volatility this benign, you do get flatter growth rates that when credit expense are more accrual especially when they’re arising and we have reached the level in credit spreads where I would suggest that the next big move is going to be wider spreads, because we are now at levels that where spreads do not normally go any lower, the key question is when that starts to happen. These are great growth rates in this kind of environments, because I mentioned in the past was so exciting about it is we are putting global EM marketplace together that includes all major currencies in the markets external debt and local markets, clients are embracing the platform in all regions we’ve had great growth and new clients coming on board in Asia, new clients coming on board in Latin America. And, technology on MarketAxess has no boundaries, so the ability for EM market participants around the world to trade with each other is not only creating efficiency it’s lowering transaction costs. And, I think when you look around your community Rich, the companies that you cover and compare our EM growth rate this quarter to everything else is going on, we look exceptionally good. And, the nice thing is it’s only the beginning because by our reckoning when we try to patch together the market opportunity in EM as well as we are doing, we still think we are high single digits in overall market share of what takes place in EM. So, there is a tremendous opportunity there, the breadth of client participation, the activity that we are seeing, the breadth of markets that are being traded on the system, all gives us great confidence that this is going to be a long term growth area from MarketAxess.
Rich Repetto: That’s fair, Rick, that’s fair. I assume one last question on BondPoint, way you explained in fact that you have a lot of the customers, you have a lot of retailer, you have a lot of small liquidity, and I guess you would expect given your liquidity, your match rates I would assume be much higher except for this what you pointed out the streaming coding capabilities. So, I guess, my question is, how fast could you build that and is that, if that’s the case like why do people have been using BondPoint, if you have the liquidity other than the streaming capability, how fast can you build it, and is it a question of allocation of investment or capital and so forth?
Rick McVey: Absolutely yes, it’s clear given the adoption of the retail client segment on our platform that there is more reason for us to invest in those modest technology changes now than ever before. But you’re right it’s all about prioritization, right? And, when you look inside the retail market in U.S. credit and you look at trade, Rich, what you will see is the total market share trades in $250,000 an under trades is about 5% of trades. So, we’ve been focusing on the 95% of the market, the retail communities operating in the 5% of the market space. Furthermore, when you look at the retail ATS business today is almost entirely D-to-D business, these are retail brokerage firms and retail market makers trading with each other, so it’s in the D-to-D space and if you look at $250,000 trade sizes an under D-to-D you’re down to about 2% Trace volume. So, that is why our priorities have been building and investing technology for the larger part of the market and for our institutional clients, but because our liquidity is so good in $250,000 an under trades, the retail client segment has been increasingly finding MarketAxess and trading on MarketAxess. So, the pricing here is here and it’s a matter of us converting that into what retail brokerage firms were used to which is price based trading rather trade based trading and we are optimistic that those are the changes that we can make and grow our participation that segment even further.
Rich Repetto: Okay. That’s helpful, Rick. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And, we do have a follow up question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Follow up on your Micro Lot market share. How much of that market share gain has been function of your effort to build up share with some of the retail wealth managers and market makers, and how much this comes from ETF market makers attend to trade in smaller lots?
Rick McVey: I think the majority of it is a former, we have always been an important venue for the retail market makers because of the Micro Lot trading that our institutional investors cannot conduct on the platform, so there are many, many trading opportunities for those market makers throughout the day on the platform and that has been a key source of liquidity for us in small tickets. The ETF are increasingly getting involved in that space and it’s been a growth area over the last year or two, but I would say that there is a much bigger participation today on the platform in those trade sizes from traditional retail market makers.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it, and then one more question if I could? Obviously still early days and your new high-yield pricing strategy and we can see what the market share has done. In your conversations with liquidity providers in the high-yield space, do they see more inclined to provide more liquidity now that their variable costs are going to be lower?
Rick McVey: I think the answer to that is yes, we are very pleased to get 10 major high-yield dealers embracing the new fee plan, it’s obviously a fee model that scales well for them, in the sense to do more volume on the system and anecdotally that’s the feedback that we are getting. And, the new fee plan obviously includes benefits for our clients and liquidity takers as well, because the variable fee is roughly half of where we had been prior to change. So, we think it’s a better fee model all around and there is no doubt in our mind that the major dealers are happier with this plan and willing to support future growth in high-yield.  The quarter in high-yield, the big difference is, it doesn’t really have anything to do with traditional institutional investors or major dealers, it’s just that the players that drive on high-yield volatility are very quite right now. And, all the ETF are - that are very active trading the shares versus the bonds, those trading opportunities right now are very limited and you can see a significant drop-off in their activity, not just here, but Patrick if you look at each share trading in the major high-yield funds, ETF funds, you will also see significant drop-offs in HYG, J and K, share trading, and that’s really the story of this quarter of our high-yield business.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All right, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And, we do have a follow up question from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys, thanks for taking the follow ups. Two real quick ones, in Eurobonds, it’s small today, but just given the market share declines over the last couple of quarters, do you see any need to adjust the pricing, and then secondly in block trading, can you give us the market share numbers and how that changed year-over-year?
Tony DeLise: So, Chris at the Eurobond side, if you recall in the second quarter earnings call, we had some comments that we’re probably in revisit to couple of elements of the fee and there were some concern that some of the dealers had raise on various specific components. In September we did make some adjustments to some very specific components all around, Europe high-yield, we actually reduced the fees and looked consistent with our market fee in our new high-yield plan in the U.S. We also made some changes to long data paper, but were weren’t see a lot of tracks and so, we had made those changes, again what Rick said on high-yield is just the macro environment is sort of dominating the landscape right now. So, it’s hard to say they had the medium impact, but we do expect that these changes have limited to some of that noise around specific components around the plan.
Rick McVey: Just a follow-up on that Chris is that, I think what you see in our European business is indicative of what’s going on broadly, on the back of the ECB quantitative easing that now and it has over the last 18 months included corporate bond purchases, Eurobond spreads are at all time low levels, and European institutional investors are trading more in EM and U.S. credits than they are in Euros. So, what you see for us overall is the European business is growing very well, but the product that are invoke and trading activity because of the demand for yield among European investors or EM and U.S. credit products not Euros. And, it’s quite possible that tomorrow might see beginning of a change in ECB quantitative easing policies, the market is awaiting their announcements on what they intend to do, but it would be a significant change if the ECB stops buying corporate bonds and storing them away on the balance sheet in terms of more trading opportunities going back to the private market and to institutional investors versus what we’ve been dealing with over the last 18 months.
Chris Shutler: That’s really helpful, Rick. And, then on the block market share?
Tony DeLise: Yes, I’m sorry Chris, on the block market share it was very consistent what you saw on the second quarter which was right around 9%. So, when you recall it, we talked about this on the second quarter call, it was around 7% last year for the full year, 8% Q1, and the last two quarters have been right around 9%.
Chris Shutler: Right, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And, we do have a follow up question from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: Hey Rick, just one follow up on your relationship with BlackRock and the Aladdin platform, is that exclusive or can Aladdin hookup or they’re already hooked up to other people or is it exclusive?
Rick McVey: They are totally hooked up to other people. That is broad trading risk and analytic solution not just for BlackRock for all of their Aladdin clients. And, so they are connected to many different trading venues as you would expect, they are serving their clients by ensuring that they’re making best efforts to always find the best price for their clients. And, as you know, they are highly confidence that when it comes to global credit card that they continue to believe that MarketAxess is delivering a great liquidity, great pricing, and efficient integration with the Aladdin System.
Rich Repetto: Got it; thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And, this concludes today’s Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-07-26 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci – Investor Relations Manager Rick McVey – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tony DeLise – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James Kyle Voigt – KBW Richard Repetto – Sandler O’Neill Conor Fitzgerald – Goldman Sachs Andrew Nicholas – William Blair
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may recorded on July 26, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, and will provide update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company’s future results, please see the descriptions of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2016. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the second quarter earnings call. Our earnings report this morning reflects the solid quarter in a difficult trading environment. Second quarter trading volumes of $362 billion, were up 7% year-over-year. Volume with international clients increases by 24%, to $92 billion and our emerging market product areas in a strong quarter with a 39% increase in trading volume. For the first half of 2017, global trading volume totaled $756 billion, up 17% from $648 billion in the first half of 2016. Total after trading clients increased 15%, to approximately 1,300 firms. Open trading continues this momentum with record client participation and new high in percentage of global trading volume. Revenues for the second quarter were up slightly to $97.3 million, expenses of $47.7 million were up 4%, diluted EPS of $1 was up 14%, primarily driven by lower effective tax rate of 23%. Second quarter of U.S. high-grade estimated market share of trades increase to 17% from 16.1%, and our competitive position continues to strengthen. In a soon-to-be released research report, branch associates will estimate that our share of electronic trading in U.S. high-grade and high-yield increase to 85% this year from 80% year ago, based on their 2017 North America institutional investor survey. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Second quarter credit spread volatility was at the lowest level we have seen in many years. At the same time, the trend of heavy inflows in the fixed income mutual funds continued, much of it driven by overseas investors searching for yield. The combination of variable market volatility and investors chasing scarce bonds create a difficult environment for electronic trade. In spite of this environment, we have been able to consistently grow market share. With four important trading days remaining in July, U.S. high-grade and high-yield estimated market share is running well ahead of Q2 levels. Overall TRACE high-grade market volumes in Q2 were flat year-over-year, while high-yield TRACE volumes were down 12%. Reduce volatility in high-yield is cost of reduction in trading by some market participants, including ETF market makers. New issue activity remains elevated, but slightly down from last year’s second quarter. Slide 5 provides an update on the global regulatory landscape. Changing regulation continues to have a significant impact on the global fixed income markets. In Europe, the implementation of MiFID II is less than six months away. We expect that MiFID II rules will increase trading on regulated trading venues, including MTFs in order to comply with new best execution and trade reporting requirements. The new regulations provide benefits for both dealers and investors, when trading on a regulated venue. Our Brexit contingency planning is well underway, and we’re in the process of registering a new EU MTF in the Netherlands. We expected to be well ahead of March 2019 Brexit date with our business and regulatory changes, in order to prevent any disruptions in trading for our clients in any jurisdiction. In the U.S., new SEC Chairman Clayton recently announced plan to establish a Fixed Income Market Structure Committee, similar to the one that exist for the equity markets. We believe that MarketAxess is well aligned with SEC’s goals of further in the efficiency, transparency and effectiveness in the U.S. bond markets. We also continue to monitor developments from Washington, relating the tax laws and bank regulation. In both cases, there is a potential for significant positive changes to the current framework. For example, proposals to amend or eliminate the Volcker Rule could increase the market marking capacity of our dealer clients. Finally, we have recently seen signs that Central Banks may become less accommodative through reducing Central Banks balance sheet bond holdings and gradually increasing rates. We’ve believe that any move to begin removing historically high monitory stimulus is likely to have a positive impact on fixed income secondary trade. Higher interest rates, lighter bank regulation and greater market volatility have the potential to increase market turnover in global credit markets. Slide 6 provides an update on open trade. Open trade volumes were $57 billion in the second quarter, with average daily volume up 42% from the same period last year. Approximately, 157,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the second quarter, up 68% from 94,000 in Q2 2016. Liquidity providers or price makers on the platform droving 104% increase in price responses in the second quarter. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $22 million in transaction costs through Open Trading on the system. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.1 basis points in yield, when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. When compared to our Composite Price real time mid-market estimates or corporate bonds, we believe that liquidity providers are achieving similar savings in transaction cost. Dealer initiated open trades reach the new high of 23% of totaled Open Trading volume in Q2. Dealers are increasingly using Open Trading as an additive distribution channel to increase trading velocity and reduce balance sheet usage. The percentage of trading on MarketAxess taking place through Open Trading protocols reached a record this quarter. Open Trading accounted for 38% of U.S. high-yield volume, 15% of U.S. high-grade volume and 13% of emerging market volume. Slide 7 provides an update on our international progress. Our increase investment in geography expansion is driving significant gains in client engagement across all major regions. International client volumes were up 24% year-over-year, driven by a 31% increase in a number of active clients to 579 firms. Emerging markets volume jumps 60% and U.S. credit was up 38% with international clients. Local emerging markets trading volumes were up 42% year-on-year. The number of active emerging market client firm’s increase by 14% to 854. On a related note, we’re pleased report that during the second quarter, we completed our first trades in Chinese Government Bonds on the platform. The number of active Latin America firms is more than doubled over last year, well the number in Asia has increased by 50%. Europe can changes its growth trajectory and active firm growth a healthy 19%. We are pleased with our progress on the international front and we’ve continue to invest heavily in both people and technology solutions, in order to capture a larger share trading in global credit markets. Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details on our financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our global volume increased 7% in spite of the continued lackluster market environment. The underlying trends remain positive as we had double-digit year-over-year increases in active clients for each of our core products. U.S. high-grade volumes were $204 billion for the quarter, up 8% year-over-year, resulting for an increase in estimated market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 10% year-over-year. Emerging markets was a standout again this quarter with trading volume up 39%. Our high-yield trading volume and overall market volume were both down around 10% year-over-year. We believe that low volatility negatively impacted our high-yield trading volumes. Our Eurobond trading volume declined 15% year-over-year. In addition to the generally unfavorable market conditions, we experience lower Eurobond hit rates and inquiry volume. We had a nice pickup in municipal bonds trading activity on the platform. Approximately 240 investor clients traded during the second quarter, up 14% from the first quarter. Trading volume was up 30% sequentially and we executed more than 8,000 trades up 36% from the first quarter. On Slide 9 we provided summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Quarterly commission revenue and overall revenue were both up 1% year-over-year. On a constant exchange rate basis, information and post-trade services revenue increased 4% with data revenue up 10% year-over-year. Operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year, leading to a small decline in income before taxes. The effective tax rate was 23% in the second quarter and reflects excess cash deductions of approximately $5.3 million, relating to the new standard for share-based compensation accounting adopted effective January 1, 2017. The full year effective tax rate is trending toward the lower end of our 26% to 28% guidance range. Our diluted EPS was $1, on a stable diluted share count of 38.1 million shares. On Slide 10, we’ve laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were consistent with the prior year, as the 7% increase in trading volume with offset by a mix shift causing a decline in overall fees per million. U.S. high-grade fee capture was little change from a sequential basis. Years to maturity and the percentage of volume in our tiered-size buckets were consistent with the first quarter. Our market share in block trading reached another record high in the second quarter. Our other credit category fee capture was down slightly on a sequential basis, due a mix shift. Fee capture for high-yield emerging market and Eurobonds were all fairly consistent with the first quarter levels. Effective August 1, we will be implementing a new high-yield fee plans for our disclosed Request-For-Quote protocol. Similar to high-grade plan, we will move to a markup model and automatically adjust the dealer quotations by standard fee. At current volume levels and current protocol mix, we expect the new plan will be mildly positive to high-yield revenue, although the line item geography will change. Based on the dealer contract sign to date, we expect that high-yield monthly distribution fees will aggregate around $1.4 million and the online variable transaction fee per million will range from 350 to 400. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially expenses declined by 1%, as lower compensation and benefits costs were offset by an increase in marketing and advertising expenses. A reduction in the variable bonus accrual, which is tied directly to operating performance and seasonally lower employment taxes and benefits accounted for the $2 million profit in overall compensation and benefits cost. The marketing and advertising spends tends to vary more than other line items quarter-to-quarter. We believe the second quarter level is more indicative of the run rate over the next two quarters. We still expect full year 2017 expenses will be within our original guidance range of $192 million to $208 million albeit we are tracking toward the bottom half of that range. Year-to-date headcount is up 22, and we expect to add 20 or more personnel over the balance of this year. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Tax and investments, as of June 30, were $366 million and trailing 12-month free cash flow is a record $160 million. During the second quarter, we paid quarterly cash dividend of $12 million and repurchased 65,000 shares at a cost of $12.4 million. As of June 30, approximately $27 million was available for future repurchases under our share repurchase program. Based on the second quarter results, our board has declared a regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with our progress to build a broader and deeper foundation in global credit market in Q2 and in spite that acquired market environment. Our investments in Open Trading and our international business both show strong momentum. Regulatory changes continue to have a positive impact on adoption rates for electronic trading and credit. Now I would be happy to open the lines for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning guys. I know you touched on it a little bit in your prepared remarks, but any further commentary on the competitive landscape right now? We’ve seen some press releases from some competitors. We’re seeing a start-up good investment from the European exchange group. So what are you seeing out there on the competitive landscape right now?
Rick McVey: As I mentioned, Patrick, we feel pretty good about our competitive position, and we believe it’s done nothing but get stronger in the first half of 2017. We have seen a few press releases, as you point out. What is notable about them is there is no consistency in the reporting of actual electronic trading volumes in most of the rest of the space. And we think it would add great value if recording became more consistent with established platforms and e-trading venues because, as you know, we see platforms commingling straight through processing volume with retail volume, with institutional volume and changing the time periods of their reporting on consistently. We don’t think that really helps to really understand the underlying trends in those businesses, so we think it would serve the market well if reporting was done monthly across all products and in a consistent way so that you and others could better understand the trends. But we take great confidence in the Greenwich Associates survey. As you know, they do a very thorough job of institutional investor surveys in North America and Europe, and we were very pleased to see their confirmation of our anecdotal feeling that our share has done nothing but get stronger relative to the competitors over the last year. The other platforms really are at earlier stages, and that also comes through in the Greenwich Associates survey. You hear from time to time as the protocols are interesting. However, I think the other platforms are generally at early stages in terms of client connectivity and have not yet had a significant impact on electronic trading volumes.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: All right, that’s very helpful. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, can you talk a little bit more about the rationale for your high-yield pricing change and if you’ve got any pushback from the dealer community about committing to the monthly distribution fees?
Rick McVey: Our feeling is that the high-grade fee model has really served institutional investor and dealer clients very well, and it’s also worked for our shareholders. So on the back of that success, we feel the time is right to move to a similar model in high-yield, and our feeling is that it is both a fair model and a scalable model. And the dealer response has been very good in terms of moving towards that model in high-yield and given the market share numbers that I mentioned earlier of our share of electronic trading in both high-grade and high-yield, the major dealers who are signing on to the new high-grade fee plan were very comfortable making those commitments.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Great, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Sir, your line is now open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Rick, just the first one, maybe just wondering what’s going on with the Eurobond growth. It seems that the market share gains have slowed a bit in the second quarter. Just wondering if you could help us understand the competitive dynamics. It seems like you had such strong momentum since lifting those RFQ limits, the dealer limits, in early 2015. I’m just wondering what are you seeing in terms of competitor reaction and what’s going on with the market share gains in that business?
Rick McVey: Sure. First of all, let me say that our European business is much broader than just euros. Our European clients are actively trading emerging markets, U.S. credit and euros within a system. In totality, we’re still very pleased with the growth momentum we have in the region. We moved out in front with the MiFID II requirement to standardize our euro fee schedules. And in that standardization process, you have some winners and some losers in terms of dealers that saw fee reductions versus some that saw fee increases. And we are working through those changes specifically in the euro product. It is possible that we will revisit a couple of elements in the fee grid to reduce any concern about any of the fee components in the euro schedule. But also remember, the European environment was not any different than the U.S. credits rating environment in the second quarter. The region saw incredibly low volatility throughout the quarter, and that clearly is also having an impact on overall trading growth rates.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then maybe my second question would just be around the Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee that you mentioned in the prepared remarks. Just wondering, can you disclose if MarketAxess has been asked to be a part of that committee? And then I guess, like, it was pretty vague in terms of what Clayton wants to do within the fixed-income markets, but it’s clear it’s going to be a focus area for him as chairman. Are you hopeful that this is the first step toward some sort of best x standard? Or just wondering what are your expectations are here.
Rick McVey: Yes. I think in terms of your focus, what we’ve seen from other regulatory initiative is focus on best execution, transparency and trade reporting. And we would expect going in that those are some of the areas that the SEC will focus on as well. It’s a little early to know what their primary emphasis will be. We are in regular dialogue with the SEC about all developments in fixed income and market structure, and we expect to continue those dialogues with them. I think it’s too early to know, how they will constitute the advisory committee, but we’re available to help the SEC any way that we can.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then just last one for me, is really around pricing. And so just that the high-yield, I guess you have explained pretty well why you decided to make that shift towards the client markup model. I guess I’m wondering in your assumptions that you give us in terms of revenue capture and distribution fees. Can you also give us kind of the assumption that you have for Open Trading as a percentage of the total high-yield mix of that? I think that, that might be a little bit higher fee capture and if you can guess hash that out. And then just one separate question on pricing would be around distribution fees. I mean distribution fees in high-grade, I get that the client markup model is working in high-grade. You’re continuing to gain market share and variable fees are scaling nicely in that business, and hopefully that translates to high-yield market as well. But the distribution fees, I think a lot of the dealers are getting access to multiples of the flow that they have just years ago, and the distribution fees remain fixed. Is there anything in the works? Or is there anything that you think longer term you may have a little bit of pricing power there? Or is there a different pricing structure, maybe more of a tiered model, you could go to for distribution fees? Just wondering any thoughts there be helpful. Thank you.
Tony DeLise: Sure. Kyle, it’s Tony. You had two questions there: the first one on high yield and then around the high-grade distribution fees. In the high-yield side, what I mentioned the prepared remarks were based on the current volume and based on the current protocol mix that we expect that the high-yield change will be mildly positive to revenue. In those assumptions, what you see is almost 14% of our high-yield volume is in Open Trading. We’re not changing the fee plan in Open Trading. And maybe a little less than 10% of our high-yield volume trades on spread, and that’s a different protocol. We’re not changing the fee plan there. So you have around 45% of our high-yield volume that when I mention again, that would be mildly positive. 45% of our volume, we don’t have any fee plan push through. I will caution on one thing and I did mention that it was based on dealer contracts signed to date, and we still have several dealers that are considering the alternative plan. And this one, similar to high-grade, we have a plan that has a distribution fee, plus the markup, and then we have a plan which is all variable. It has an execution fee for each trade, plus the markup. So depending on what dealers elect, you could see some swing in the distribution fee and you could see some swing in the fee capture. So we’ll have to see how this plays out over the next several months. But based on what we know right now, we think the distribution fee will be around $1.4 million a month, and that fee capture will range from 350 to 450 per month – per million. The second question you had there, Kyle, was on distribution fees for high-grade. And Rick mentioned the beauty of the high-grade plan, the plan we put in place 12 years ago, and it scales incredibly well. And it promotes responses and promotes liquidity. We think we’re in the right range. And you could argue that we have pricing power because the dealers are seeing multiples of the volume that they saw 12 years ago. But we have no current plans to change the distribution fees. Again, it is something that scales well. We’re introducing it now with high-yield, and we believe that will be an impetus to promote liquidity and promote more responses on the high-yield plan as well.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Repetto from Sandler O’Neill. Sir, your line is now open.
Richard Repetto: Good morning, Rick. Good morning, Tony. I guess just to follow-up on the competitive situation. I guess the tier that you talked about and the discrepancies that you talked about in reporting, Rick, I think the market acknowledges and we acknowledge, but still the pricing is much different. I guess the question is – and I don’t think at this point your market share is still growing, but potentially it has a growth rate than impact. Not that it has grown, not that it’s positive growth, but it does – it’s slow – impact at all is growing as less fast just given this pricing. And by the way, from conversation with them, they certainly are willing to verbally disclose these things about the retail, about full electronic and the differences in reporting.
Rick McVey: Yes. So a couple of things on that. First, Tradeweb is primarily a rates platform, so it is notable that they’re talking about everything except their rates business. Secondly, when you really do try to decipher what they put out in press releases and split out phone trade capture, which is really trade processing and not electronic trading from their retail business and their institutional business, you clearly come to a very quick conclusion that we continue to grow much faster in the institutional credit business than Tradeweb or any other competitor. And if you look, Rich, at the first half of this year, our total volumes are up $180 million from the first half of last year, and our high-grade volume is up about $56 billion or $450 million per day in increase year-over-year. So there is no question that we are widening the lead. And I think if Tradeweb wants to provide transparency, they would show a consistent and long-term trend of their retail business, which they are now commingling with institutional business in their press release. As you know, they bought the retail platform, BondDesk, which is now Tradeweb Retail, four years ago. I think the market would benefit from knowing what those trends are. Anecdotally, people say they’re down, not up. Including phone trade capture is something that we do not do. We have more than $40 billion additional volume in U.S. credit and phone trade capture that we do not confuse with electronic trading volume and our reports to you. And when you really get down to what is actually institutional trading volume, yes, it’s slightly up from where they were in the first half of last year but that growth rate is not anywhere near the MarketAxess growth rate year-over-year. And that is confirmed by the Greenwich Associates survey as well.
Kyle Voigt: Understood, thank you. I guess just the other question is, Tony on the sensitive that you put out last quarter on revenue capture, and that was just the variable pricing. Does that still hold given the price changes?
Tony DeLise: So Rich, are you referring to – I gave some revenue sensitivities on the high grade.
Kyle Voigt: That was high grade. Yes, high grade there. Okay, so all the high-grade variable capture from the prior quarter is still in place. Is that correct?
Tony DeLise: Yes. So what I talked about in the first quarter was if we had a one year change in maturity in high grade for high-grade trading, it could change fee capture by somewhere between $10 and $20 per million. If there was a 1% change in yield across the yield curve, that’s going to be $10 to $20 per million. I think just following up on that and just to provide a little bit more transparency, right now, on high grade, the high-grade fee capture has been $162 per million the last two quarters. We think we’re in the middle of the historical range of high-grade fee capture. So it’s been as high as $200 per million. And if you look back historically and you overlay what we’re doing in Open Trading and you overlay with our all variable plan, probably the low end of the range would be something like $125 or $130 per million. So we think we’re somewhere in the middle right now.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Sir your line is now open.
Conor Fitzgerald: Hi, good morning and thanks for your comments on the market share in July. Just hoping you could give a little more color on what you think drove the market share improvements given – and I think the overall market environment has kind of been pretty similar to 2Q. Just wondering what’s changed.
Tony DeLise: it’s hard to point that anything has changed from a market environment standpoint. And you can see that it’s still strained from a volatility standpoint. Market volumes are down. New issuance, the best we can track right now, looks like it picks up a little bit in July. I think it’s somewhat what Rick said, when you look at the underlying trend, with more clients engaged and more flow on the platform and Open Trading, percentage of volume conducted in Open Trading picking up, those underlying trends are all positive. Hard to point anything discrete right now that’s moving that market share up right now.
Conor Fitzgerald: That’s helpful thanks. And then just one on MiFID II, thanks for your thoughts there. Do you have a sense of how quickly you would expect behavior to change? Should we think about increased adoption of electronic trading quickly following the January implementation date? Or do you think it takes a little bit longer? And I just want to get your updated thoughts on what this could mean for the data part of your business?
Rick McVey: I think that the percentage of trades that are traded or processed through regulated vendors will grow early in the new year. As we make the rounds with dealer and investor clients, the combination of best execution requirements for both investors and dealers and the onerous trade reporting regime has most market participants coming to a conclusion. That’s just going to be easier to comply with those regulations when the trade goes through a regulated trading venue. There is a gray area which is basically phone trade capture, which trade takes place off venue and then be processed through a venue and achieve the same benefits in terms of trade reporting. And I think that remains to be seen, but there is some optimism that, that will be acceptable with the MiFID II rules as well. So a lot to be determined on whether this radically change the amount that’s traded electronically. But at a minimum, more trades will be going through MTFs. On data, we are – we have invested in and expanded our regulatory reporting offering to be both an ARM and APA in a new environment. We’re especially pleased with the progress that we’re making with large institutions within mandates for their trade reporting for MiFID II. So the set of data that will be available should be broader. Over time, I think there will be more and more transparency requirements where all regulated trade reporting entities have to participate in a consolidated tape. But our base of data should continue to be strong post January with MiFID II.
Conor Fitzgerald: Thanks. And then just – sorry, just one last one, if I could sneak it in. I just want to circle back to Kyle’s question. Is there a certain level of volume where the price changes are negative? Just trying to get the sensitivity and kind of some of the breakpoints around high-yield fee change.
Tony DeLise: Yes. So Conor, there is – with the new plan in place and again, remember, we’re going to have a – for our major dealers, a distribution fee and then what is in effective fixed markup. As volume increases, if you were simply comparing fees under the old plan to fees under the new plan, revenue under the new plan would be lower as volume increases. But I’ll give you one big caveat there. If you ask me what do fees look like if volume doubles in high yield, Rick and I would sit here and tell you, we’re not sure what the current fee plan and if that scales that well. And when you have individual dealers receiving bigger and bigger bills every month under the existing plan, we don’t think that, that plan scales extremely well. But if volume doubles, for example – and again, I’m saying all things equal, protocol, mix the same and the dealer roster on the distribution fee plan versus the all variable fee plan, you could see something like a 5% or 6% decline in overall revenue if volume doubles. And again, a lot of assumptions in there if volume doubles and simply comparing the old fee plan to what we have on the new fee plan.
Conor Fitzgerald: That’s helpful thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Sir your line is now open.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi, This is actually Andrew Nicholas on for Chris. My first question was on block trading. I think you mentioned that market share block trading had reached another high, a record high this quarter. I’m just wondering if you could provide a bit more color on that progress, what you think the primary drivers are, whether or not it results a new protocol like Private Axes or maybe a function of the current market environment.
Tony DeLise: Yes. So I did mention that for block trades, we hit a new record high. And it’s been – we’ve seen a steady march up in our market share in over $5 million in trade size and went from a year ago in the second quarter a little over 7%. First quarter, we were at 8%. And now in the second quarter, we hit 9% in block trading. We’ve got all of the new protocols that we’ve launched over the recent years has been – have been addressed on how we break down those resistance points in block trades, and it’s been a historical resistance point. We are trying to address the concerns about information leakage. We have different trading styles and abilities to contain that information leakage in, and client adoption is picking up. We think it’s a big area for us. It’s a big opportunity for us. And I think everybody would have discounted our chances years ago. We feel much better about the share opportunity and definitely treat the block trading area as a big addressable market for us.
Rick McVey: I think what’s coming through is that both dealers and investors are seeing execution benefits on the MarketAxess system across all trade sizes. What we have done to really connect the global credit markets and introduce new and valuable counterparties to dealers, investors is really valuable. And people are seeing the transaction cost savings and the efficiency gains in block trading in the same way that they always have in $5 million under trades. So the percentage of volume that we’re doing north of $1 million has moved up to around 70% of our volume. We think this is a very encouraging sign for future growth.
Andrew Nicholas: Great, thank you, that’s helpful. And then second, I just wanted to ask if you could give us an update on progress with munis. Just wondering if or how you think about a time line for success there and if that’s changed over the past several quarters.
Tony DeLise: We’re pleased with the progress on munis. I know we went with this with open eyes. We knew it wasn’t going to be easy, but we continue to make progress. And we had comments in the prepared remarks that we have more clients engaged, more inquiry flow on the platform, we’re executing more trades. We did close to $2 billion in the first half of the year in muni trading. And one of the positive things there, almost 50% of the volume was in Open Trading, so this was one of the reasons that we felt confident and comfortable launching trading municipal bonds. We thought we had something to differentiate our platform. Open Trading is serving that purpose and half the volume has come through in Open Trading. There are significant transaction cost savings. Just like Rick talked about on the transaction cost savings in U.S. high grade. On the municipal bond side, we’re measuring transaction cost savings in Open Trading, it’s almost $0.50 or almost $500 per million in transaction cost savings when trading takes place through Open Trading. So we do feel good about it. It’s a big market opportunity. Are we – do we wish we were further along? Yes, we do. There are challenges there. There’s some headway in doing this. We need more flow on the platform. There’s some dealers that we need to prep and connect to the platform. So we’re still as enthusiastic as we were a year ago about the opportunity and the ability to pick up share.
Andrew Nicholas: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And I’m currently showing no further questions. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rick McVey for any further remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-04-26 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - Investor Relations Rick McVey - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tony DeLise - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill Kyle Voigt - KBW Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs Chris Shutler - William Blair
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MarketAxess Holdings First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, April 26, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess first quarter 2017 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, and will provide update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company’s future results, please see the descriptions of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2016. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the first quarter earnings call. We are pleased with the start to the New Year with many new records to report. First quarter trading volumes reached record levels with total trading volume up 27% to $394 billion. Quarterly average daily volume records were set across all four core products. We believe this is an extraordinary outcome in light of the challenging market environment that saw record new issuance and unusually low market volatility. On the back of the growth in trading volumes, we delivered record revenues for the quarter of $104 million, up 17%. This marks the first quarter we've surpassed $100 million in revenue. Expenses were up 9% and operating margins expanded to 54%. Record pretax income of $56 million was up 25% and record diluted EPS of $1.11 were up 44%. All four core products continue to show year-over-year gains in market share and open trading volumes reached a new record. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Record new issuance in the quarter led to record trade volumes in both high-yield and high-grade. Seasonal factors and the anticipation of higher rates drove record U.S. high-grade new issuance up 13% from the same period a year ago. We believe that the record high-grade new issue activity led to the increase in trade volume and the increase in block-trading during the quarter. U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate debt outstanding is now approximately $8.5 trillion. Demand for a new issuance was driven by heavy inflows of high-grade and high-yield bond fund. We believe international investors continue to flock to U.S. credit markets in a global search for yield. Market conditions in the first quarter were far from ideal for normal secondary trading flows. Yet despite the record new issuance and low credit strengthen and interest rate volatility, we were able to grow trading volume 27% and revenues 17% this quarter. Slide five provides an update on open trading. Open trading volumes reached another record high of $59 billion in the first quarter with average daily volume up 56% from the same period last year. Approximately 145,000 open trading transactions were completed in the first quarter, up 76% from 82,000 in Q1 2016. The number of unique liquidity providers or price makers on the platform continues to increase. The first quarter saw 672 firms providing liquidity, up from 527 in Q1 of last year. This expanding pool of participants help drive a 103% year-over-year increase in open trading price responses. In the first quarter, liquidity taker saved an estimated $25 million in transaction costs through open trading on the system. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.6 basis points in yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through open trading protocols. Dealer initiated open trades reached a new high of 22% of total open trading volume in Q1. Dealers are increasingly using open trading as an additive distribution channel to increase trading velocity and reduce balance sheet usage. The percentage of trading on MarketAxess taking place through open trading protocols continues to increase across products. Open trading accounted for 34% of U.S. high-yield volume, 15% of U.S. high-grade volume and 11% of emerging market volume in the first quarter. Slide six provides an update on our international progress. Our ongoing investment in international expansion is leading to significant gains in clients and market share in Europe and showing promising signs in Asia and Latin America. Our global emerging market bond trading business has become an important engine of revenue and earnings growth. European client volumes were up 55% year-over-year driven by 24% increase in a number of active client firms. Emerging market volumes in Europe experienced a tremendous quarter with volumes up over 100% year-on-year. U.S. credit cards were also a key driver this quarter with a 61% volume increase. Emerging markets trading continued to accelerate with local markets trading volume of 79% year-on-year. Trading in local currency bond is now available in 25 local emerging markets. The number of active emerging market client firms increased by 16% to 837. We are seeing growing participation with firms located outside of North America. In the first quarter, there were 509 active client firms driving an increase of 53% in electronic orders on the platform. We are encouraged by the returns we were seeing from our increased investment outside the U.S. and we believe we are well-positioned to capture a larger share of trading in growing global credit markets. Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more detail on our financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 7 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were a record $219 billion for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year on a combination of higher estimated TRACE volume and higher market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 37% year-over-year. Emerging markets was a standout this quarter with trading volume up 69%. We believe that our emerging markets high-yield and Eurobond estimated market share increased year-over-year as growth in our trading volume exceeded the growth in estimated market volume. We had a nice pickup in client engagement and trading activity in municipal bonds in the first quarter and executed almost 6,300 municipal bond trades, up threefold on a sequential quarterly basis. Trading is taking place across this globe, request for quote, and Open Trading protocols and over 300 firms have executed a trade since we launched the platform in 2016. With three trading days remaining, April month to-date estimated high-grade and high-yield market share are tracking well above the first quarter levels. However, market volumes across all products are down from the first quarter levels with U.S. high-grade and high-yield TRACE average daily volume down close to 20%. Slide 8, we provided summary of our quarterly earnings performance. The 19% year-over-year improvement in quarterly commission revenue was the primary driver behind a 70% increase in overall revenue. On a constant exchange rate basis, information and post-trade services revenue increased 11% on stronger data sales. Pre-tax income increased by 25% and the operating margin percentage reached a record 53.5% in the first quarter. The effective tax rate was 23.6% in the first quarter and reflects excess tax deductions of approximately $5.8 million relating to the new standard for share-based compensation accounting adopted effective January 1, 2017. Based on our current share price, we’re estimating an additional $10 million of excess tax deductions for equity awards expected to be exercised or vest over the balance of this year. As a result, we are lowering our effective tax rate guidance for 2017 to a range of 26% to 28%. We do caution that this new standard can have a significant impact and cause volatility in the company's net income effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share. Our diluted EPS was $1.11 on a diluted share count of 38.1 million shares. As we mentioned on the year-end earnings call, the adoption of a new accounting standard resulted in an increase in the diluted share count of roughly 400,000 shares. On Slide 9, we've laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. The 23% growth in total variable transaction fees was due to the 27% increase in trading volume offset by a mix shift causing a decline in overall fees per million. Let me provide a few comments on our U.S. high-grade fee plan. The plan on fee grade have been in plan and unchanged since 2005. Because our plan is tiered based on ticket size and because the fees we earn are depended on bond duration, fee capture will vary from period to period. In addition to our distribution fee plan, we offer dealers the choice of an all variable fee plan. As a result, the dealer mix also influences the fee capture outcome. U.S. high-grade fee capture declined by $23 per million on a sequential basis. A shift to bonds with lower average years to maturity and larger trade size were responsible for the drop in fee capture. We also had one dealer switch from the all variable plan to the distribution fee plan at the beginning of the quarter. An important factor this quarter was the significant increase in block trade where we not only saw an increase in the percentage of block trading in the broader market, but our share of such volume increased to record levels. This is all additive revenue albeit at a lower fee rate. Our other credit category fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis even though there was a mix shift between products. Fee capture for high-yield emerging market and Eurobonds were all consistent with the fourth quarter. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. Virtually all of the 9% sequential increase in expenses was due to higher compensation and benefits cost. The variable bonus accrual, which is tied directly to operating performance, was $2 million higher. Employment taxes and benefits were up $2.2 million and reflect the typical first quarter seasonality where items like employer taxes are front-end loaded. Salaries were also $600,000 higher and reflect an increase in head count and wage adjustments affected the first of the year. On a year-over-year basis, higher compensation and benefits costs accounted for the largest variance reflecting a rise in headcount and greater variable bonus accrual. Average headcount was up by 37 people or roughly 11% versus the first quarter of 2016. On Slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Tax and investments, as of March 31, were $356 million compared to $363 million at year-end 2016. During the first quarter, we paid out year-end employee bonuses and related taxes of roughly $32 million and the quarterly cash dividend of $12 million. We also repurchased 65,000 shares at a cost of $12 million under our share buyback program. As of March 31, approximately $39 million was available for future repurchases under the program. Based on the first quarter results, our board has approved a $0.33 regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. The first quarter represents a great start to the New Year with volume and share gains driving attractive revenue and earnings growth. We continue to ramp up our investment in open trading in order to provide meaningful trading solutions to our dealer and investor clients in this new regulatory environment. Our business is becoming increasingly global and our institutional client footprint provides the foundation for future growth. Now I would be happy to open the lines for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Rich Repetto: Hi, Rick, hi, Tony.
Rick McVey: Hi, Rich.
Tony DeLise: Hi, Rich.
Rich Repetto: Hi. The first question is on the rate and you’ve given a good explanation of what happened this quarter and can you talk about what happens like in a rising rate environment, what would the pricing – expect the pricing movements to be?
Rick McVey: It’s a good question, Rich. You know there's – there is lots of items that influence our high-grade fee capture. But it’s not only that, that duration element which is years to maturity and yield sensitive, but it is trade side sensitive and dealer mix sensitive and the number of factors that flow in there. I would give you a little bit of a rule of thumb and it is imperfect or exact science, but what we generally is that every one year in maturity – every change of one year in years to maturity that equates to roughly $10 to $20 per million and then every 1 percentage point change in yields would be another similar amount, $10 to $20 per million. Now I give it as rule of thumb, they are not exact, but that would generally frame it out. And one other thing I did mention in the prepared remarks, we have that one dealer move from the all variable plan to the fixed plan, a move like that typically one dealer that $3 or $4 per million. So there is a number of items that factor in, but using those as a benchmark or rule of thumb you can do some pluses and minuses off of where we are today.
Rich Repetto: I understand, that’s helpful. And I guess one follow-up, Rick. The record Open Trading, we know that that’s an important aspect of the story here and the dealers, I guess, making up, I believe is 22%. I guess my question is can you talk more about, which dealers are doing it? Are these the large dealers or is there any like more specifics you can tell us about, so we can understand a little bit about what’s happening on the dealer side? I will leave it at that.
Tony DeLise: Absolutely. No, it's a mix of dealers across large and regional and smaller dealers, so it’s – the participation level is across the board. It's not every dealer, but the vast majority of dealers are now taking advantage of the liquidity pool that we have built through open trading. And, obviously, Rich, as you know, the comment I made earlier is just dealer initiated trades at 22% of our volume. Dealers are also responding to trade opportunities through open trading when they have not seen the order disclosed and they represent roughly a third of the respondents and liquidity providers in Open Trading. So we're really encouraged by what we see in the growing participation in usage from dealers in Open Training both in taking liquidity as well as in providing prices.
Rich Repetto: Got it. Got it. And one last quick question, the tax rate volatility you spoke to Tony, does that have to do with the share price or actually share – maybe the same and shares issued, is that what’s going to drive potential volatility in the tax rate quarter to quarter?
Tony DeLise: It’s a couple of things, Rich. So it’s – it’s not only where our share price will be when awards vest or awards are exercised, but it’s also the timing of when options, for example, are exercised. So we can predict with the perfect knowledge when a restricted stock award will vest. What we can't predict is the share price; at least we know the exact timing. Options on other side, we know, for example, we have a batch of options due to expire in January of 2018. Every one of those options are in the money, every one of the options will be exercised the exact timing, we just don't know right now. So we size it up and we can tell you based on today’s share price, we do expect the tax benefit for the balance of this year to be around $10 million, the exact timing is what we struggle with a little bit. So, I say for lack of anything else right now, honestly, I’d straight line the impact in the effective tax rate over the next three quarters, but it could swing up or down a little bit.
Rich Repetto: Got it, helpful, and thank you. I appreciate the answers.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.
Kyle Voigt: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Tony DeLise: Hi. How are you, Kyle?
Kyle Voigt: Tony, just a follow-up on the rev capture. Is there any way you can disaggregated how much of the decline in the high-grade capture was related to the higher average trade size because I think just a bit of unusual quarter for industry wide volumes with more of the volume being block trades in the past, I’m just trying to get a sense for if block trading falls back to more normalized levels in the second quarter industry wide and for MarketAxess, what could that mean for a fee capture?
Tony DeLise: Right, right. So for the – if you are looking sequential, that fee per million drop was $23 per million, but the biggest and – this is in order of magnitude, the biggest item and it was a little less than half was years to maturity dropping about half of the year and then yields were up a little bit. So a little less than half of that $23 per million was on duration. The second biggest piece was the larger trade size. And order of magnitude, that was responsible for $7 or $8 per million and then you have the third piece which was the smaller one on the dealer mix. So if you’re trying to disaggregate and isolate the trade size impact, it’s at $7 or $8 per million. And Kyle when you look at – if you think about going forward, it’s tough to predict where this is all going to – where it’s all going to come out. I could tell you that looking at April, the block trade size is back consistent with where it’s been in the past eight to ten quarters. With the first quarter anomaly, it looks higher than where it was in the prior eight or nine quarters, April is back down to where it's been right now.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, it's really helpful. Thanks, Tony. And then just one on – more of a strategy related question, but, I mean, clearly you’ve been focused on the institutional side and have a full plate there on growing market share in institutional business, but, Rick, I’m just wondering if you could revisit some of your thoughts around whether it could make sense for you to eventually get into the retail side of the business, especially, if there's an opportunity to acquire a meaningful asset in that space?
Rick McVey: We certainly in the past were always interested in acquisitions that would add to our product capabilities or client segments and the retail space is of interest to us. Having said that we still do not see any meaningful overlap between retail fixed income trading and institutional trading. So the level of synergies there may not be as high as some people think, but it is a client segment that would be of interest to us.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then one last one for me, I think in the last call you talked about opportunity that MiFID II presented for your business. I think generally there's been focus on the need for demonstrating best execution and what that can mean for electronic trading in Europe. I guess, my question is MiFID is more on the potential for spill over into the U.S. as some of these large global firms might take best practices globally adhere to these, so just Rick can you give us any color as to what you're seeing on U.S. side and if you think there could be an acceleration of electronic trading because of MiFID more globally?
Rick McVey: Sure. I think it's a very good question, Kyle, thank you. And, first, within Europe we have little doubt that the new regulations will cause an increase in electronic trading in European fixed income and I think it's partly related to the best execution requirements that you mentioned, it’s also related to the huge burden placed on market participants for trade reporting. Some of the rules that require as many as 90 fields on every trade to be reported are so onerous that it's almost impossible to imagine doing those trades the old fashion way manually. So, I think, it's a combination of best execution in the trade reporting requirements that are likely to cause an increase in electronic trading within Europe. We are seeing more and more global investors that are active in European fixed income that are starting to apply those same standards beyond Europe because they're running global portfolios. And as a result, we see an increase in the demand for best execution analytics across regions and not just in Europe. And I think there were two common themes there is that one is the regulatory focus on best execution arguably led by the changes in Europe with MiFID II, but not exclusive to Europe. Regulators throughout the U.S. are also more focused on best execution and they have been in the past. So that trend is there and the other is that the asset owners themselves we hear consistently are regularly asking more questions of asset managers about how they think about best execution in their fixed income portfolios. So there is a widening interest and focus on best execution. And as we’ve mentioned in calls in the past one of the investments that we've made in our analytical capabilities is related to that and that is we're now providing TCA analytics for all trades that are conducted on our platforms to serve that need from our clients.
Kyle Voigt: It’s very helpful, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning, guys.
Rick McVey: Hello, Patrick.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So following up with the discussion of block trades, you guys have disclosed this in the past. Can you tell us what your market share was for block trading during the quarter?
Rick McVey: We are – in terms of share of tickets during the quarter, we’re, I believe, just a little bit over 10% and in terms of volume a bit below 10%. So, it’s edging higher along with our overall share and the key theme in the first quarter, Patrick, is that the share of blocks in all of trades were up from prior quarters.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, it’s definitely something that we noticed. And then given what you just, I’m kind of backing into blocks may have been around a quarter of your U.S. high-grade volume during the quarter, does that sound right?
Tony DeLise: I’m just opening up the sheet and over 5 million was – pretty close Patrick. It’s very hard to report.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All right.
Tony DeLise: Yeah.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All right. Got you. Thank you.
Rick McVey: I do think it reflects the growing comfort that clients have in executing blocks on the platform and what we notice is that that block orders not surprisingly garnered the most attention of any orders on the platform. So the quality and breadth of price responses grows with trade size. And as a result, good experiences we think will lead to repeat activity from those clients that have had great execution results executing blocks on the platform.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. That’s helpful. A question about industry-wide volumes, you know it was a very strong quarter for both U.S. investment grade and U.S. high-yield issuance, but industry-wide high-grade volumes were up, I think, 14% year-over-year, while industry-wide high-yield was basically flat on an ADV basis. What do you think really is driving that divergence, why don't we see more trading in high-yield?
Rick McVey: I think it’s a couple of things. First of all, the high-yield new issue calendar did not grow to the same extend that high-grade did. So, there was not that direct connection from growth in high-yield issuance that we think drove the high-grade TRACE volume. The other factor that’s impacting both but I would argue high-yield more is the lack of volatility. And this was a highly unusual quarter in terms of credit spread volatility and we believe that that caused a reduction in turn over for active portfolio managers in high-yield.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. That makes sense. Going back to the conversation on best ex requirements in Europe, can you talk about how your best execution and TCA solution is may be differentiated from some of the others that are out there because it is something that we're starting to hear other companies talk about as well?
Rick McVey: Sure. There is room for multiple solutions. We think that we have a logical place in TCA for global credit markets. And it’s really two things, Patrick, first is access to quality data. So, you need a comprehensive database of fixed income transactions in order to do a credible job on TCA for clients. And we have three main sources for data to compare execution quality. The first is obviously the TRACE data in the U.S. The second is the comprehensive data that we have in Europe for European fixed income through Trax. And the third is our own trading data. And as a result, we worked really hard to put together a database that is meaningful for our dealer and client – investor clients so that they can compare execution quality of their trades irrespective of whether they're conducted on the platform or through traditional means. And that is why we think we've got a role to play in TCA within the global credit markets. We are not really doing much on the rate side because we do not today believe that we have those same comparative advantages in rates for TCA that we have in credit.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. And then one more, Tony, going back to the tax rate question, I appreciate that this is all kind of work in progress but as you think to 2018 and beyond, should there be a sustainable tax rate benefit from your new accounting or is that kind of a 2017 item, and then your initial guidance going into 2017 of 32% to 34% that's probably the appropriate starting point for 2018 and beyond.
Tony DeLise: Patrick, never take these items lightly but we've been - you know how we performed which is, we've been in a situation we've had a rising share price for a long period of time, and even when you look back the past five years, the EPS benefit had we been under the new rules, the past five years, the EPS benefit would have been between $0.10 and $0.30 in ETS. You look forward, so this is more forward-looking. I could tell you sitting here today, based on where our share price is trading and assuming that every restricted stock we invest and every option is exercised, I could tell you we're sitting on somewhere between $60 million to $70 million of excess tax benefits to be recognized over the next four years. So, yes, they hurt the fees and sizeable fees that we expect to be recognized in 2018, in 2019, in 2020 but again it's all predicated on where the share price is. It's predicated on the timing of when would options for example get exercise but that's a little early to start talking about guidance for next year but I would bake in some elements of tax benefits going forward as well.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All right. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Conor Fitzgerald: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask on the number of active trader firms you’ve seen growing outside of North America? Not sure if you have any idea of what the addressable market is or large firms that are current – meaningful firms that aren’t currently active on the platform that could be? Just kind of trying to get a sense of how much more run rate you have to add active trader firms outside of North America?
Rick McVey: I think the majority of the large global firms I know they're already active on the platform but the asset management industry outside the U.S. is more fragmented and we think that there is still a much larger list of potential clients. And we were encouraged by what we see in terms of the growth rates across our product capabilities from European clients but also really encouraged as we ramped up our sales commitment to the region in Asia at client on boarding that’s taking place in the region. So if we are over 500 active firms outside the U.S. now, I would not be at all surprised to see that that number double over the coming years.
Conor Fitzgerald: That’s helpful. Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask on the higher revenue from data that you mentioned. Can you just talk about what drove that? Curious if the core market participants interested in buying your data? Or is the value proposition of the data you're providing is improving maybe that’s increasing demand?
Rick McVey: It is - on the data side by way of history on that one, we've been growing the data business around 10% a year in data revenues. It does get masked a little bit more recently because of the FX impact. There's a chunk of our revenue that is generated out of the UK so it does get matched a little bit. But we're providing volume reports and pricing reports and reference data all content that resonate with clients. It is part of the growth story. We think we can grow that data revenue going forward. Just in terms of costing, can data be 25% of our revenue going forward? I think we still have tremendous room to grow market share and tremendous room to grow our commission revenue and volume. So I do believe we’re going to grow the data revenue but we are also in early stages on market share penetration. So, yes, it's going to be an important element in part of the growth story going forward but it's - I don't know we get that 25%.
Conor Fitzgerald: Thanks. And just maybe just circling back on that, any updated thoughts or potential opportunities to sell data that you're currently not providing in the market just given there does seem to be increased demand for your data set?
Rick McVey: I think that a couple of factors there. We are developing new data products in conjunction with our clients every quarter. And as our trading activity grows in terms of share but also in terms of the breadth of products that we cover, it does give rise to new data opportunities going forward. And so the short answer is, yes, we do believe that we can increase the set of data products that we provide. I would echo Tony’s comments that given the momentum that we have in our trading business, we still expect the main engine of revenue and earnings growth to come from the trading side but our data products are increasingly providing a necessary important service back to our clients. And the other thing that we said many times is that the key part of data is also enhancing our trading platform. So we are constantly thinking about how we can add more value to clients in both pre-trade price discovery and those tools have continued to advance over the last three or four quarters with a real time composite prices now available in addition to trades and track price to help all of our dealer and investor clients with pre-trade price discovery. And that’s an conscious effort to make the trading system more valuable and help in the goal to continue to increase trading market share. So some of what we do in data is for standalone growth in our data business and a key part of it is also enhancing the trading experience on the platform.
Conor Fitzgerald: Got it. [indiscernible] really difficult to transfer about some of the variables but give a sense of your average client who can provider or pays for your data services their propensity to trade in your platform versus those who don't? I know it's probably a tough question to answer just because the larger firms are obviously buying the data and trading more. But I’m just wondering upon an apples-to-apples basis if it’s kind of feeling on your comments if there is a correlation between all as equal as you pay for the data and those who don't in terms of trading activity?
Rick McVey: I don't know that we have that exact data that would give us the correlation. I can tell you that there is no doubt in our mind that our data products in our post-trade TCA and the other things that we work on extensively to add value to our clients are a key part of why they come to the trading platform and trade every day. And oftentimes when they recognize the value of that data, then they want that data delivered into their - directly into their own trading systems through APIs. And so often that's where it gives rise to the data revenue opportunities for us. So they are directly connected but I don't think we have any quantitative data that would answer the specific question that you have asked today.
Conor Fitzgerald: It was a tough one but appreciate the color. Thanks.
Rick McVey: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris Shutler: Hi guys, good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Chris.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Shutler: If you break down the open trading volume into the client segments I know there's the pie chart in the presentation and we look at the long only asset managers that are winning the trade, so the 38% in the first quarter. Can you just give us some sense of how concentrated that trading is today and are you seeing any greater sense of urgency amongst asset managers just kind of changed their work flows?
Rick McVey: Sure, I think the pool of open trading price providers that I mentioned in the prepared remarks with 670 firms or so would tell you that it is not that concentrated. The vast majority of our clients have set up electronic watch list in the system for the bonds that they care about and match their portfolio needs and when they find matched opportunities as many of them are now clearly in practice of being able to lead with the price. So I think that's a really encouraging sign for future growth. And with respect to the sense of urgency, it varies by firm and there's a lot of work involved in changing the trading process with the coordination, with the order management systems, and the coordination that’s required between PMs and trading managers. And when you look at the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth, we're making progress every quarter and we’re really encouraged by what we see in terms of shifting the dealer and clients behavioral pattern to participate more actively in open trading. And I continue to believe that the market environment will have something to do with the sense of urgency. Right now things are pretty benign. We have a very low volatility quarter but I think these tools will be incredibly important to the global credit markets when return to more normal levels of volatility.
Chris Shutler: Okay. Thanks, Rick. And then switching gears in Eurobonds, you saw I think strong 19% growth in your volumes year-over-year but that was a bit of a deceleration from prior quarters and I know the calculation there is a bit of an estimate. The market share gains I think seem to slow a little bit. Is there anything to call out there on the Eurobond side in the quarter?
Rick McVey: I don't think there's anything to call out. Our European business is much broader than Eurobonds as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and we have similar activity levels with European clients in EM and U.S. high-grade, and the growth rates were better there this quarter than they were in Eurobonds but I don't think there's anything specific to call out. And when we look inside the Eurobond market, we see many of the same dynamics that we reported on today in U.S. high-grade with a pretty active quarter on a relative basis for Eurobond new issuance and extremely low volatility of credit spreads.
Chris Shutler: Okay. And Tony on the tax rate, I just want to make sure that I have this right. So, excluding the share-based compensation accounting, you'd be like a 34% to 35% tax rate still, correct?
Tony DeLise: That's exactly right.
Chris Shutler: Okay.
Tony DeLise: Looking at the first quarter, that would've been right at 34% excluding the excess tax benefit.
Chris Shutler: Okay. And the $60 million to $70 million, that’s the total value of the tax benefit from [indiscernible] and stock comp at today’s share price.
Tony DeLise: That’s exactly right.
Chris Shutler: Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then lastly, just a housekeeping item, can you give us the open trading revenue I'm not sure if I missed that number.
Tony DeLise: We didn't give the open trading revenue but I could tell you it was a record quarter and it was right around $12 million.
Chris Shutler: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please go-ahead.
Rich Repetto: Yes, just one quick follow-up. On expenses if you analyze this quarter's expense, it seems like you're at the low end. I guess Tony if there is any more color on how would you see the growth of expense in the next few quarters and do you expect to still be in this range?
Tony DeLise: So, Rich, if you ask me today expense guidance, I think we're going to come smack dab in the middle of the guidance that we provided originally which was $192 million to $208 million. You're right, if you analyze the first quarter, it will get to the low end but there are a couple of swing factors in there, headcount is part of it. We do expect to add headcount over the balance of this year. We were up eight or 10 people in the first quarter. We expect another 30 or 40 new hires over the balance of the year. So that headcount does play into it. You may have seen that marketing expense for example was lower in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter, it’s a bit episodic. But we do expect the marketing expense year-over-year will be up around 10% that’s going to influence Q2, Q3 and Q4 as well. So those items when we look over the balance of the year, right now puts the smacked out in the middle of that original guidance range.
Rich Repetto: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Rick McVey for closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to updating you next quarter. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-01-25 10:00:00) =====
Executives: David Cresci - IR Manager Richard McVey - Chairman and CEO Tony DeLise - CFO
Analysts: Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James Kyle Voigt - KBW Cantor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs Chris Shutler - William Blair Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill Hugh Miller - Macquarie
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, January 25, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
David Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess fourth quarter 2016 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter, and will provide update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The Company’s actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company’s future results, please see the descriptions of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2015. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Fourth quarter trading volumes match the record levels of the second quarter, and were up 35% year-over-year. Quarterly average daily volume records were set in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets and Eurobonds. This is an extraordinary outcome given the normal seasonal factors impacting the quarter, a combination of strong market volume growth post the U.S. elections and continued gains in market share contributed to the results. On the back of the growth in trading volumes, revenues for the quarter were $94.4 million, up 23%. Pre-tax income of $50 million was up 36%, and EPS equaled our record quarter at $0.88 per share. Based on our estimates of market volumes during the quarter, combined aggregate market share of our core products, including high-grade, high-yield emerging markets and in euros, we see new record high during the quarter, and was up a full 2 percentage points from year ago levels. Slide four highlights our full year results and continued strong growth rates. Revenue and earnings growth for the full year in 2016 shows an acceleration of our long-term growth rates. Full year 2016 revenue was a record $317 million, up 22% from 2015, and diluted EPS was up 31% to a record $3.34 per share. Both revenues and earnings growth in 2016 were well above long-term growth rates. Commission revenue for 2016 was up 25% year-over-year to a record $332 million, as overall trading volumes reached a record $1.3 trillion, up 34%. We are beginning to see returns from the increased investment in both our U.S. and our international business. We estimate that the five year compound annual growth rate for aggregate market volumes across our core products was 1%. Comparatively, our trading volumes show a five year compound annual growth rate of 20%. This means that market share gains continue to be the primary driver of volume and revenue growth. In light of our strong results and our outlook, the Board of Directors approved 27% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share. Slide five shows our volume and client growth by products. Our year-over-year volume gain of approximately $330 billion was by far our largest ever. The growth in trading activity was driven by share gains with existing clients, as well as the ongoing addition of new clients. Combined U.S. high-grade and high-yield volume of $879 billion was up 27% from 2015. We now have approximately 900 client firms active in these product areas. We are especially encouraged by the growing momentum in our international business with both emerging markets and Eurobond activity reaching new annual records. Eurobond volume was up 77% year-over-year with more than 400 firms active on the trading system. Emerging market volume was up 54% from 2015 with approximately 800 client firms trading. We believe our growing global client footprint and the breadth of our trading capabilities create a strong foundation for future growth. Our history of cross-selling success also gives us confidence in our ability to develop new marketplaces, such as municipal bonds and leverage loans. For the full year 2016, we had 727 client firms trading three or more products on MarketAxess, up from 429 in 2012. Slide six provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading experienced another record year with average daily volumes up 86% from the fourth quarter of last year. Approximately 125,000 Open Trading transactions were completed during the quarter compared to 58,000 in Q4 2015. We continue to be encouraged by the increasing number of unique liquidity providers or price makers on the platform. The fourth quarter saw 660 firms providing liquidity, up from 469 in Q4 of last year. This expanding tool of participants help drive a 223% year-over-year increase in Open Trading price reached bonds, clients taking liquidity on the system, saved an estimated $29 million in the fourth quarter due to the expansion of the liquidity pool. The profile of Open Trading liquidity providers continues to be fairly evenly split between dealers, investors, and alternative market makers. The ETF community is increasingly active, and we are investing in additional trading functionality and ETF analytics for this growing client segment. Over 18% of combined U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield volume on MarketAxess now takes place through Open Trading, up from approximately 13% a year ago. Participants benefit from average cost savings of approximately 3 basis points in yield when they complete a U.S. high-grade transaction using Open Trading protocols. Open Trading technology enhancements will remain a key focus area for investment in 2017. Slide seven provides an update on the global regulatory landscape. Regulatory change continues to have a meaningful impact on our clients and on our business. In the U.S., we are monitoring the regulatory landscape as it unfolds under the new administration. Our current understanding is that it's unlikely that we will see any proposals to reduce bank capital requirements. Higher bank capital requirements have led the balance sheet constraints for market making. However, it is widely expected that we could see changes in implementation or delays in more controversial aspects of financial regulation like the Volcker rules. There is also much discussion on potential corporate tax reform. MarketAxess would benefit from lower overall U.S. tax rates. However, some proposals on lower taxes was a repatriation of foreign earning or reduction in the tax deductibility of corporate interest payments, could have a negative impact on the pace of growth of new debt issuance. It is far too early to speculate on the outcome of potential tax changes. In Europe, we are focused on the opportunities presented by MiFID II in relation to clients’ increased preference to TRACE on regulated venues that can help them fulfill their new obligations under MiFID II. We expect that the new regulatory focus on demonstrating best execution will lead increased demand for electronic trading, as well as data products to allow market participants to compare transaction prices such as Axess All. In sum, we currently believe that the likely regulatory and tax changes will be net positives for the Company, but it is too early to predict the outcome with any degree of certainty. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed look on our financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide eight for a summary of our trading volume across the product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $185 billion for the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. The increase in volume was evenly split between an improvement in market share from 15.1% in 2015 to 17.2% in 2016, and estimated 14% increase in TRACE volumes. Volumes in the other credit category were up 49% year-over-year. Emerging market bond volumes increased 59% due to growth in estimated market share, and an increase in estimated market volumes. Gains in our Eurobond and high yields trading volumes were almost entirely due to a pick-up in estimated market share. In January, we are seeing year-over-year market volumes across our core four products, up an estimated 10%. We expect that our overall average daily trading volume in January will be above the fourth quarter levels. With five trading days remaining in January, estimated U.S. high-grade market share demonstrating a decline from the December and fourth quarter levels beyond this typical seasonal movement, and reflects the impact of the record pace of new issuance early in the year. On slide nine, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. The 23% year-over-year increase in revenue was primarily due to the uplift in trading volumes, and resulting 27% improvement in quarterly commission revenues. If the dollar versus sterling exchange rates held constant year-over-year, overall revenue would have increased by additional $2.7 million. On a constant exchange rate basis, information at postpaid services revenue increased by 14% on stronger data sales. Total expenses in the fourth quarter were $44 million, up 11% year-over-year and up 15% on a full year basis. We continue to invest in our business, and at the same time, deliver improved operating margins. For both fourth quarter and full year, pre-tax income increased by 30% or more, and the operating margin percentage for full year 2016 reached 52%. The effective tax rate was 34.1% for both the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Compared to 2015, the 100 basis points reduction in the full year effective tax rate reflects the higher percentage of income attributable to lower tax rate jurisdictions, and a reduction in certain statutory foreign and state tax rates. Our diluted EPS was $0.88 on a diluted share count of 37.7 million shares. On slide 10, we’ve laid out our commission revenue, trading volume, and fees per million. The 36% increase in total variable transaction fees was entirely due to the increase in trading volumes. U.S. high-grade fee capture declined by $4 per million on a sequential basis. There was no appreciable change in the average years of maturity or trade size bucketing between the third quarter and fourth quarters. We expect that first quarter 2017 U.S. high-grade distribution fees will be similar to the fourth quarter of 2016. Our other credit category fee capture increased by $12 per million on a sequential basis, primarily due to a fee plan change for European bonds. Dealers were given the choice of adopting one of several standard plans, consisting of varying minimum monthly commitments. Under the new plans, distribution fees are eliminated and fees per million traded deferred based on maturity. The overall Eurobond fee capture now looks similar to our U.S. high-grade figure. For the fourth quarter 2016, Open Trading revenue was $11 million, more than double the fourth quarter of last year. And Open Trading protocols were responsible for 15% of overall trading volume. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. On a sequential basis, expenses were slightly above the third quarter level. Higher Open Trading related advertising costs were offset by lower variable bonus accrual and employer taxes. On a year-over-year basis, higher compensation of benefit costs accounted for the largest variance, reflecting a rise in headcounts and greater variable bonus accruals. We closed out 2015 with headcount of 383 compared to 342 at year-end 2015. The year-over-year growth in professional and consulting fees was driven by implementation efforts, surrounding several important infrastructure projects. And higher Open Trading related advertising costs accounted for the bulk of the market and advertising expense increase. On slide 12, we provide balance sheet and capital management information. Cash and investments as of December 31st were $363 million, and the 2016 free cash flow reached a record $136 million. Dividends and share repurchases aggregated $63 million or approximately 46% of free cash flow in 2016. Our current quarterly dividend is an important element of our capital management strategy. The 27% increase in the quarterly dividend follow the 30% increase in 2016, and 25% increase in 2015. We've now increased the dividends in seven consecutive years. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 63,000 shares at a cost of $10 million under our share buyback program. As of December 31st, approximately $51 million was available for future repurchases under the program. We are increasing the investment in our trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure and view this continuing investment spend as a competitive advantage. Through our existing cash positions and strong cash flow generation, we have the flexibility to fund our investment priorities and return capital to shareholders. On slide 13, we have our 2017 expense capital expenditure and income tax rate guidance. We expect that total 2017 expenses will be in the range of $192 million to $208 million. The midpoint in that range suggests an approximate 12% year-over-year increase in expenses, which would be slightly above our five year compound annual growth rate adjusted for the Trax acquisition in 2013. For purposes of generating the expense guidance, we've assumed that the sterling to dollar exchange rate all at 1.25:1. We expect that 2017 capital expenditures will range from $25 million to $30 million. The midpoint in that range reflects an increase of approximately $9 million over the 2016 level. The majority of this increase relates to a new datacenter build-out and upgrades through existing datacenters. We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2017 will range from 32% to 34%. The mix of U.S. and foreign sourced income and the impact of a new standard governing stock-based compensation accounting could cause variations in the effective tax rate. Beginning in 2017, there is a mandate exchange in stock-based compensation accounting, which impacts among other items, the accounting for Windfall tax benefits, statement of cash flow, classification of such tax benefits and the computation of delivered share count. Our tax rate guidance incorporates and estimates for the Windfall tax benefits related to restricted stocks schedules invested in 2017, but does not include any Windfall tax benefit on potential stock option exercises since we can't predict Windfall's exercises will occur. This standard will create volatility in our quarterly effective tax rate. Also, while we don’t provide specific guidance on our diluted share count, we estimate as the new standard will increase our diluted share count by approximately 400,000 shares beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Rich has some earlier comments on potential changes in U.S. corporate tax policy. Based on the information available, we estimate that every 1 percentage point reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate would have increased 2016 EPS by approximately $0.04 per share. Now, let me turn the call back to Rich for some closing comments.
Richard McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the full year results we were able to achieve in 2016. It is clearly the adoption rates for electronic trading in global credit markets are accelerated. Our success in Open Trading is adding valuable new liquidity solutions to our dealer and investor clients. Our global client footprint continues to grow, supporting both geographic and product expansion. Regulatory changes are likely to continue to support growth in open electronic markets. And let me close with a word of thanks to all of our employees. Your innovative spirit and dedication delivered outstanding results again in 2016. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] Our first question is from Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: I was curious if you have any preliminary thoughts on what sort of impact any relaxation of the Volcker Rule might have. Obviously, it's very early and we don't know if it's even going to happen. But curious if you have any expectations of what it might mean in terms of market share or liquidity or anything else?
Richard McVey: Our belief is that it would be a net positive for market liquidity, if there was some relaxation, the implementation of Volcker Rule, where it really has an impact in credit, currently in less liquid bonds, where if it's difficult to prove the ability to turn those bonds back over in an expeditious manner, it's difficult to comply with the current Volcker Rule. So, we think we would open up more market making and less liquid areas of credit. And would allow bank owned dealers if they choose to use their capital more for proprietary trading, and the net resulted that we believe would be a positive for market liquidity.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: And then maybe one for you, Tony. With your expense guidance for 2017, it's pretty wide range from the low-end to the high-end. Can you talk about what drivers might cause it to come in at a high or the low end? And, I guess, what are some of the key areas that you are planning on investing-in in 2017?
Antonio DeLise: I’d say one thing on the range of the absolute range, arguably, in the past we’ve probably provided two types of guidance range. But when you think about top to bottom if you take the midpoint, we’re talking about a 4% swing from top to bottom. And those big swing factors or those big variables there, it's typical of what you’ve seen in the past. And we had headcount, which there is an expectation that we will grow headcount in 2017 at a similar pace of what you’ve seen in the past two years. The timing of when that headcount additions come-in and attrition is a little uncertain, so that could be a swing factor. We have the variable bonus accrual that’s tied to operating performance. We generally build the accrual over course of the year as a percentage of pre-tax pre-bonus income that could swing from top to bottom. And honestly foreign exchange, which you did see that in 2016, that foreign exchange movement could impact the expense results, and we had something like $40 million to $45 million sterling of expenses. So, it has a change in the sterling to dollar exchange rate of any amount, it could swing from top to bottom.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then one last one for me, and then I will jump back in the queue. So, as we look at your Open Trading statistics, obviously, you’re having a fair amount of success with it. But it looks like you're having particular success with high-yield. And I think by our math, maybe one-third or so, your high-yield TRACE are now being done through Open Trading. Why do you think it's been particularly successful with high-yield?
Richard McVey: What we see so far is the percentage of Open Trading is highest in the least liquid product areas. And I think it's where the expansions of liquidity pull and utilizing the network, or broadly has the biggest impact for clients. So, it's quite possible that it is connected as well to the constraints that dealers have not, just on their balance sheets but also because of Volcker. And we do see that the Open Trading match rates are greater in high-yield. It's also where we see the most significant activity from the ETF community, which is a growing base of capital that's coming to work in market making and the credit markets.
Operator: And our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Just given the recent change in pricing on Eurobond trading, I guess, I have a separate question relating to the current dealer pay model pricing in high-yield and emerging market products. I know in the past you’ve stated the desire to eventually migrate this to a client pay model. Can you just give us updated thoughts here, and if there is anything in the works over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks.
Richard McVey: We’re always working on any enhancements or changes in the fee model that would provide the proper incentives for dealers and investors who use the platform more. And the reality is that we think we've been in a pretty reasonable spot across most products. Eurobond volume growth has been greater than what we have observed in other product areas over the last 18 months or so. So, the short answer is we don’t have any changes in mind to share with you this quarter. But we have seen great results with the scalability of morals that have the concept where liquidity taker pays, and that is what we've embedded into Open Trading. And we believe that longer-term that will be the model of choice around fixed income electronic trading.
Kyle Voigt: And then, you mentioned on the slides, Brexit potentially impacting your passport to the EU, and that you’re evaluating strategic alternatives there. Could you just give us some more color around what options you are considering, and if these options would be material with respect to incremental ongoing expenses?
Richard McVey: Sure. I don’t think our current approach is any different than what you would see from other financial institutions that are primarily located in London today. We are working, both with our internal team as well as our external advisors to consider a variety of different factors around locations that will continue to be within the EU, post Brexit, to look at the regulatory environment across the labor laws, et cetera, to make a determination of where we think we might be best suited, assuming that we need to establish a separate regulatory entity outside the UK. So, that work is now relatively advanced. On a relative basis, I don’t -- the incremental cost is not high for us. We would envision that the majority of our employees would remain in the UK. So it’s likely that an office within the EU would be smaller, and we would seek registration within that regulated entity. But the relatively – the incremental cost would be relatively low.
Kyle Voigt: And then last for me is just another follow-up question the potential rolling back or easing of the Volcker Rule. Just wondering, if you view this as a risk at all to growth rates that you’ve been posting in Open Trading, and some of these other liquidity solutions that you’ve developed for the market, which are specifically gaining a lot of traction in less liquid products, such as high-yield TRACE?
Richard McVey: I really don’t -- I think that more freedom for dealers to make markets where they choose, subject to their constraint, is a good thing. And more market liquidity that improves credit market turnover would be a net positive for us and others in the business. So, we don’t see that as an impediment to the growth rates that we’ve been seeing overall or through Open Trading. I do think that one of the offsets to this is that there is clearly more regulatory focus on best execution, and that is explicit in the MiFID II rule set. And so investors are very quickly moving to embraced transaction cost analysis for fixed income as part of the regulatory environment, it's most pronounced in Europe, but we’re seeing that trend accelerate in the U.S. as well with a significant amount of demand for both transaction data, as well as PCA. So, that is one the factors that I think is continuing to accelerate the adoption rates for investors into electronic trading venues.
Operator: And our next question is from Cantor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Cantor Fitzgerald: First, just on corporate tax reform and how it could impact MarketAxess, I think there has been a pretty healthy debate this earnings season from CEOs about how much of lower corporate tax rates would fall to the bottom line versus be shared either with employees or competed away. It looks like you are assuming the vast majority of the benefit accrues to shareholders. But wanted to get your thoughts on how lower corporate tax rates could affect that interplay?
Antonio DeLise: Cantor, on the corporate tax rate side, there is obviously still a lot of uncertainty around there, even President Trump’s proposal and the House Republican blueprint are not completely aligned. Even though over the course of the campaign, president Trump’s proposal did more closely align with House Republican side. Even when I try to model out the impact on 2016, we have to make some assumptions around what happens to research related deduction and research credits. There is uncertainty around what happens on the repatriation side, the two plans are different, that are different on not only how they treat cumulated earnings but then how they treat earnings on a perspective basis. So there is still little bit of uncertainty there. I’d tell you that looking at some of the thesis that some of the sell-side analysts put out, I think we’re generally in line with the impact on MarketAxess. For us 2016, roughly 85% of our earnings were domestic, 15% were foreign. We do expect some shift in that mix going forward, favoring foreign side. And rates today are obviously much lower outside of the U.S., so like many companies, we would benefit from that rate reduction.
Cantor Fitzgerald: And then just following-up on your comments around the outlook for new debt issuance, I know your share of trading from new debt issuance is considerably lower than other bonds. But is there a way for you to get a little more specific on your market share for new debt issuance, and how we could think about declining DCM activity potentially impacting your volumes?
Richard McVey: January is a classic example where we are in a very heavy period of new issuance, and in fact reasonable chances that it could end up being the best month for hybrid new issuance ever. And we’re in a risk on environment. So in that kind of combination investor focus does shifted to new issue calendar, and there are plenty of swaps and trades being done to make room for the new issues. And just typical pattern that we see is short-term weakness in the share around those heavy periods of new issuance, but it typically response fairly quickly. And our view is that a larger corporate bond market is a very good thing for our future growth. So we have clearly benefited, over the last five years, as the corporate debt markets has gotten to be about 80% larger over that time period. So long-term, we think that more debt issuance is a positive for the size of the opportunity. This is one of many factors that we think will be debated extensively throughout this year. And what we’re hearing from our advisors is that their expectation is that it's more likely the corporate tax changes are going to hit in ’18 versus ‘17. So, we really don’t know where it comes out. But the deductibility of the corporate interest payments is one of five or six factors that would impact issuance. And you see other important factors, like the level of M&A, economic growth, the opportunities for CapEx and increased investments, all having an impact on what we will see from corporate debt issuance. When you put that all together, when we look at the Street research currently, the expectation is that 2017 issuance will remain at levels that are close to or around 2016. And certainly, January is even faster than what we saw a year-ago; so not a big impact we think this year, and we’ll run more about it as the proposals become more clear throughout 2017.
Cantor Fitzgerald: And then one more, if I could. On Open Trading, I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting the stats correctly. But it looks like the depth of the order book is improving a lot, if I just look at volume up 86%. The TRACE response is up plus 200%. But I wonder if you could just confirm that and talk about how the depth on that platform has changed over the last year.
Richard McVey: Yes, so I think that’s fair to say. The depth of that market is growing in every client segment. Investor adoption for Open Trading is growing each quarter. We enhanced our technology solutions to make it easier for both dealers and investors to identify potential trade matches through Open Trading. We’re seeing new capital come into the market with additional dealers that are focused on electronic markets, market making. I mentioned earlier that the ETF community continues to grow, and this is a highly valuable tool for to create the gain process, and the relative value trading that goes on between ETF shares and bonds. And then what other efficiency gain from Open Trading is we are clearly making cross-regional business more efficient than it has been in the past. So, each quarter, we see greater participation in all of those areas. And we’re also seeing dealers using this system increasingly, not just as liquidity providers but as liquidity takers. So, it's actually an asset in balance sheet velocity for dealers, there’s another tool and another distribution channel for them to move bonds along more quickly.
Operator: Your next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. 
Chris Shutler: So, first, I guess just an industry question. So, as you think about industry-wide volume growth in high-grade, I think you’ve talked historically about expecting maybe low single-digit type of growth over the long-term. Given the 5% growth in TRACE volume in ’15, and then I think 17% in ’16. Has your perspective there changed for the next three to five years, I guess, excluding any future regulatory changes? I guess, ultimately I am just trying to figure out if industry volume growth could be, if this is sustainable?
Richard McVey: There are so many different factors and variables that impacts credit secondary volumes. It's hard to be overly scientific about predicting where they might go. What we’ve said in the past about the long-term outlook is that turnover of credit has been steadily declining over the last five years. And we think that the combination of the new bank capital requirements and the low volatility environment we’ve been in have contributed to a decline in overall turnover rates. So, the optimistic view would be, look, we may be entering a different period for the interest rate environment, which could positively impact volatility. There are expectations that economic growth could improve relative to where we’ve been over the last three or four years. Volatility would be a positive for market turnover, and is something that bank regulations are relaxed, where it’s easier for them to go back to work on what they do well in market making, I think that would be a net positive as well. What we’ve heard from investors is that their active portfolios have not been turning over at normal long-term averages it's directly related to low volatility. So, we are carefully watching, because we think volatility would be good. And relaxation of bank regulations around market making would be a positive. And then clearly, what we and others are doing to really promote all-to-all trading and create a more open market, historically, it's been very good for turnover. So, we are connecting market participants that were not able to trade directly with each other in the old model, and we are reducing transaction cost. And those two things have historically improved market turnover. So, we are not expecting a wildly different environment for TRACE volumes this year. But longer-term, we are more optimistic that the growth rates could be higher than what we've seen over the last three of four years.
Chris Shutler: And then, maybe could you just give us an update on your progress with loss rates. And I don't know if there are any kind of market-share stats you could share there where you stand in the fourth quarter versus maybe a year or two ago. That would be helpful.
Antonio DeLise: Chris, on the block-trading, I'd say on market share, generally speaking. In the fourth quarter, we had gains year-over-year across all size buckets. There were gains in the block-trading side bucket as well. When we measure it, we look at TRACE information we measure our market share, sometimes its right around 8% of volume. And it's up year-over-year. But again, we’re reporting gains across all size buckets. It's probably more evident again or more evident in our suite-spot right now where we are picking up share in the block trade, as well. And honestly, when you listen to what Rick is talking about in terms of protocols and Open Trading, lot of the effort here is around evolving protocols to address larger trade sizes to get more involved in trading in block-trade. So we do spend a lot of effort and time with thinking about protocols focused on the block trade areas.
Chris Shutler: And then just one last real quick one, the fee rate in other credit, which ticked up quite a bit. I know you’ve called out the fee plan change. But when did that fee plan change go into effect? Was it in effect for the full quarter?
Antonio DeLise: Yes, for Eurobonds, it wasn’t effect to the full quarter in. At this time, virtually all of the 40-plus dealers have transitioned on to a new fee plan. And I did mentioned in the prepared remarks that that fee capture, the fee capture, now we’re four months into it. The fee capture now looks closer to high-grade. Honestly, it's a little difficult to predict, because it is a maturity base, there is the maturity base features in there does vary by the types of European bonds. So there is some variability in there. But right now, it's looking like, the fee capture is looking like what you see from the high-grades standpoint.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Rich Repetto: I guess, I am just -- I've been hearing a lot of questions on the high-yield and the Open Trading. And I can see the dramatic improvements you’re making in Open Trading. But I guess I'm trying to see whether I understand the pie-charts and stuff correctly. But it looks like the mix moved away from high-yield into the other category. And it actually looks like on high-yield that, at least quarter-to-quarter, that there was less volume done in high-yield on Open Trading. Am I reading that properly?
Antonio DeLise: Rich, unless the pie-charts are -- tell the whole story. I’m looking at something, which you don’t have in front of you. But from a percentage standpoint, high-yield percentage of volume represented by Open Trading did increased quarter-to-quarter. And I’ll give you rough number that went from 31% in the third quarter to 34% in the fourth quarter. So, it did pick-up. I have to look at market volumes, and high yield may have been down third to fourth quarter, I don’t have that in front of me right now, but that could be causing some of the variation.
Rich Repetto: I was just looking at the pie graphs, I guess. And then…
Richard McVey: I think it’s true within other categories, Rich. The growth rates in Euros and EM in Q4 were higher overall than they were for yield. And I think that it was just a lower volatility environment too much of the quarter in Q4 that negatively impacted the high-yield volume growth rate. So, I think that’s what you’re seeing in the shift.
Rich Repetto: If you just take the 24% of your $831 million in ADV, that would get the high-yield Open Trading volume, correct? From that pie -- the pie says 24% on page six.
Richard McVey: That is what it should be telling you guys.
Rich Repetto: And then, I guess, the next question is on the comp and headcount. I guess the question is the quarter was up in revenue nicely quarter-over-quarter. I’m just trying to see how you’ve accrued for bonuses, the bonus accrual? Because it looked like seasonality -- there was no seasonality in 4Q as you had a strong revenue quarter.
Richard McVey: So, Rich on the variable bonus, we’re pretty transparent on how that accrual builds up and how the formula works. If you read our proxy statement, you’ll see that in all of that glorious detail the formula is spelled out. In this case -- and this typically happens. We will accrue throughout the year based on the formula. And then year-end growth around and we do lots of other things at year end. We’re looking at pure benchmarking. We’re looking at mix of compensation between variable bonus and equity. And we make that refinement or adjustments at year-end. Albeit, this year-end, it’s a little more notable. And so, there was an adjustment pushed through in the fourth quarter. We think it’s the right mix from a compensation standpoint, but there was an adjustment push through in the fourth quarter, a little more equity, a little less into the cash bonus accrual.
Rich Repetto: And Rick and Tony, you’ve been growing fastest, at a rapid pace and investing. And when I look at incremental margins, you still got a strong 65%, well above the regular -- your standard operating margin. I guess the question is, I know this was asked. Is that -- do you look at the incremental margin in managing that investment spending, the amount of investment spending, as well, or is that not -- again, because you’re dropping more to the bottom line -- well more than what you’re investing?
Antonio DeLise: Rich, I can honestly tell you that we’re not managing to the margin number, or really that incremental margin in terms of the investments that we're making. We arguably look over the past three years, probably during the most significant investments period in our corporate life, maybe outside of starting up that's the firm. So we've been investing to expand the geographic reach in launching new products and increasing the addressable market, and investing in Open Trading. And we still increased the margins. You look over the past three years it's gone from 45% to 52%. So we’re not managing to that in margin outcome, but you can see when we've invested heavily, it has influenced the top line outcome. And where with the guidance we provided and we've got another -- planned another year of investment in 2017, and we think for all the right reasons. And you can see that impact coming through in the top line and also in the margin expansion.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Hugh Miller with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Hugh Miller: So, just one housekeeping, the follow up on the discussion, I definitely appreciate the insight on Eurobonds and variable fee capture that should be somewhere in the ballpark of high-grade. On the fixed-rate fees, just want to clarify that all the dealers are now in the new plan. Did the fixed-rate fees stay on the fourth quarter track at roughly about $350,000 or does that fall to zero in the first quarter?
Antonio DeLise: It probably will not fall to zero in the first quarter. But it may go down slightly, and so we’re talking about $300,000, there was still one or two dealers transitioning. And part of these plans and not to complicate, but part of these plans, there are monthly minimum commitments built into all those plans. And you’ll recall, even for U.S. high-grade where we have the similar concept. If a dealer doesn’t meet their monthly minimum commitments, we take that unused monthly minimum and we put it into distribution fee line. So you’re probably still going to see some residual coming out of Europe on the distribution fee line, to the extent we may have some dealers that aren’t meeting their monthly minimum commitments.
Hugh Miller: And then just a question or two on Eurobond, last year, we did see that shift in European investor appetite for high-grade for U.S. high-grades from Eurobond, post the ECB bond buying program. How do you see things in 2017 playing out in terms of mix of interest from European investors between those asset classes?
Richard McVey: Between, which asset classes…
Hugh Miller: Between the U.S. high-grade and Eurobond among the European investors, we kind of saw search for yield and some increased adoption of trading in U.S. high-grade from those investors last year. And I was just wondering whether or not you’d anticipate maybe more of a migration back to Eurobonds trading? We’ve read a little bit about the ECB potentially being less active in corporate bond buying this year. Just I was wondering if you anticipate that there might be any changes in terms of that mix.
Richard McVey: I would expect more of the same. You’ve stronger economic growth and lower unemployment in the U.S., which is causing the Fed to begin increasing rates here, which is likely to increase the yield differential between the EU and the U.S., and you have a very strong dollar. So, my expectation would be that we will continue to see healthy inflows from Europe and Asia in the U.S. credit products.
Antonio DeLise: And Hugh I would just add that on the market volume standpoint, even with the ECB actions in the corporate bond spaces that started up back in the May-June timeframe. We haven’t seen any appreciable impact in overall market volumes for Eurobonds. We’ll have to see what happened with this continued ECB program, at least the more recent information in there kind of continue with the buying, and that rest is down a little bit in April. But we’re going to continue throughout the year.
Hugh Miller: And another one there, obviously, you guys have indicated that you’re having tremendous success in terms of taking share of electronic trading in Eurobonds. As we think about just the overall level of electronic trading in Eurobonds, is there an expectation that we should see a greater percentage of bonds being traded electronically over the near to medium term? Or would you anticipate that that level of electronic trading should be fairly steady?
Richard McVey: What we are hearing from both dealer and investor clients, Hugh is that the MiFID II obligations around trade reporting are so comprehensive that there will be rolling appetite to conduct those trades electronically. And I think we’ll run into the same differentiation between block-trades and flow trades where you have fewer block-trades, and clients will have different views about the best way to execute them. But for any flow trade or well impact trade, our understanding in talking with many investors and dealers is that it's going to be far easier and more cost effective in Europe to conduct those trades electronically, and comply with all the new trade reporting rules that they both have. So, we would expect, and we’ve already seen that, to an extent that the electronic share of the Eurobond market has been increasing. We would expect that to continue into the implementation of MiFID II next January.
Hugh Miller: And then last for me, just as we think about the investment last year you made in munis and levered loans. Are you guys comfortable just giving us a sense of how you guys are thinking about the impact of that in 2017? Is there, either a revenue or market share target or range that you guys are thinking about and striving for, for this year?
Richard McVey: Yes, both higher. Listen where we are today in our core market is very different than where we were five years or 10 years ago. What we’ve learned is that any new market takes time. And while we’re working with many of the same clients and the dealers, we’re working with the different set of traders. I will tell you that the numbers in munis in particular months-in months-out, quarter-in quarter-out are getting better. And we continue to invest very heavily in enhancements for the municipal bond market. The same could be said of leverage loans. And we had approximately 160 investors active on our muni platform in Q4, about 50 viewers. So in that market, we moved from on-boarding to training, and we’re starting to see each week the activity levels grow. And we continue to believe that our technology solutions are very good fit for the municipal bond market. So, we remain optimistic and we will continue to invest throughout 2017, and beyond. Leverage loans is in earlier stage, we are on-boarding more clients and dealers, its earlier stages. We're doing trades and we're optimistic there. It's really hard to predict exactly what the growth rates will be. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are confident that we have the right solutions for both of those markets.
Operator: I am not showing any further questions at this time. So, I'll now turn the call back over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Richard McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. All the best for 2017 and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Executives: Richard McVey - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Antonio DeLise - Chief Financial Officer David Cresci - Investor Relations Manager
Analysts: Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods Christopher Shutler - William Blair Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill Hugh Miller - Macquarie
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, October 26, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
David Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2016 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. This morning we reported strong third quarter results driven by significant gains in trading volume. Third quarter revenues were $90 million, up 22% compared to the third quarter 2015. Pretax income for the quarter was $46 million, up 31% from a year ago and diluted EPS was $0.82, up 37%. In the first few days of October, we surpassed $1 trillion in year-to-date trading volume for the first time ever, greater than the previous record of $980 billion in all of 2015. Q3 trading volumes of $322 billion, up 34% from a year ago, were driven by record results in emerging markets volume as well as growth in Open Trading volume across products. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share was 16% in the third quarter, up from 14.9% a year ago and estimated high-yield market share was 7%, up from 5.9%. In EM, our volume grew 61% year-over-year, compared to a 22% increase in estimated market volume, reflecting strong market share gains. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Third quarter market volumes showed a normal seasonal slowdown from the second quarter levels. Strong demand for credit bonds was in evidence due to persistently low government bond yields and the ECB corporate bond purchase program. U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes were up 19% versus Q3 '15, while high yield TRACE volumes were down 1%. ETF high yield activity on our platform was slower this quarter due to lower market volatility. U.S. high-grade new issuance was active in Q3 and is up 29% from the same period a year ago. We expect full-year high grade issuance to be similar to last year. U.S. high grade and high yield corporate debt outstanding is approximately $8.5 trillion. The ECBs corporate bond buying program which amounted to purchases of nearly €2 billion a week, contributed to tighter U.S. and European credit spreads. For the second consecutive quarter, fixed income mutual funds saw significant inflows while dealer balance sheets increased slightly. Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volume reached another record high of $44 billion in the third quarter with average daily volume up 90% from the same period last year. Over 105,000 all trades were completed during the quarter compared to 45,000 in Q3 2015. The number of unique liquidity providers or price makers on the platform continues to increase. In the third quarter the list grew to 655 firms, up from 421 in Q3 a year ago. This expanding pool of participants helped drive a 250% year-over-year increase in Open Trading price responses. In the third quarter of 2016, liquidity takers saved an estimated $26 million in transaction costs through Open Trading on the system. As adoption rates increase, Open Trading cost savings for our clients will accelerate further. It is important to note that during the quarter, we were able to negotiate an improved clearing rate with our third party clearing agents, resulting in meaningful cost savings for trade settlements. Tony will walk through the details shortly. Open Trading is growing in importance for both investors and dealers. Investors are finding unique funds with lower transaction costs while dealers are utilizing the platform more for both market making and as a source of liquidity for their own trading book. Slide 6 provides an update on our international progress. Our international growth an expansion agenda is experiencing tremendous momentum driven by a significant increase in participation from international clients. European client volumes were up 70% year-over-year with 400 active client firms. We are seeing healthy growth in trading volumes across Eurobonds, emerging markets and U.S. credit products from European clients. Emerging markets trading was a key driver this quarter with local market trading volumes up 86% year-on-year. The number of active emerging market client firms increased by 15% to 784. We are seeing increased participation from clients outside of North America with 483 firms trading. Last week we received regulatory approval to operate in Australia where we will begin a broader sales and marketing effort. Inquiry count from firms outside of North America grew by 83% year-over-year to 220,000 increase, creating a growing set of market making opportunities for our dealer clients. We are pleased with the progress we are making in expanding our global client footprint and believe we are well positioned to capture the opportunities presented in growing global credit markets in the midst of significant regulatory change. Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more detail on our financial results.
Antonio DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 7 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $178 billion for the quarter, up 27% from the third quarter of 2015 on a combination of an almost 20% improvement in TRACE volumes and the increase in estimated market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 46% year-over-year. Emerging market bong volumes increased 61% due to growth in estimated market share and an increase in estimated market volumes. Gains in our Eurobond and high yield trading volume were entirely due to a pickup in estimated market share as market volumes were flat year-over-year. We just completed our first full quarter of trading in municipal bonds and are pleased with the early post-launch results. Clients are trading non-taxable and taxable munis across our full suite of protocols. We have documented almost 300 investor clients and 100 dealers, and approximately 2800 trades have been executed since the launch by over 200 firms. With four trading days left in October, we expect overall average daily trading volume will be above third quarter levels. We expect U.S. high-grade and high yield market share will be below third quarter levels but well above October of last year. On Slide 8 we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. The 22% year-over-year increase in revenue was primarily due to the uplift in trading volumes and resulting 25% improvement in quarterly commission revenue. If the dollar versus sterling exchange rate held constant year-over-year, overall revenue would have increased by an additional $2 million. On a constant exchange rate basis, information and post-trade services revenue increased by 9% on stronger data sales. Total expenses were $44 million, up 13% year-over-year. Expenses would have been up 19% if the sterling to dollar exchange rate was held constant. The quarterly and year-to-date expense growth reflects our continuing investment in people and systems to support our growth initiatives. Our operating margin has expanded to 51% for the first nine months of 2016 and year-to-date incremental margins were 62%. The effective tax rate was 33.3% for the third quarter and reflects favorable adjustments resulting from the conclusion of an IRS audit and a filing of prior year tax returns. The year-to-date tax rate of 34.2% is now tracking at the low end of our full-year 2016 guidance range. Our delivered EPS was $.82 on a diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On Slide 9, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. A 34% increase in trading volume, a relatively flat overall fee capture, led to a 35% year-over-year increase in variable transaction fees. The sequential increase in distribution fees was due to a fee plan switch by one dealer during the third quarter. Our U.S. high grade fee capture was consistent with the second quarter level. For the full quarter there was no significant movement in the duration of bonds traded on the platform, trade size and dealer fee plan mix. Our other credit category fee captures influenced by the product mix between euro bonds, emerging markets and high yield volume, mix within a product and protocol mix. The very strong growth in emerging market volume resulted in a mix shift within the other credit category which accounted for the majority of the $12 sequential reduction in fees per million. For the third quarter of 2016, Open Trading revenue was $10 million, more than double the third quarter of last year, and Open Trading protocols were responsible for 14% of overall trading volume. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. A majority of the $5.1 million year-over-year increase in expenses was due to higher compensation of benefits cost. Salaries and employer taxes and benefits were up $2.9 million and reflect a rise in headcount over the past year. The variable bonus accrual which is tied directly to operating performance was $800,000 higher. Several important infrastructure projects are driving the year-over-year growth in professional and consulting fees and higher advertising cost accounted for the bulk of the marketing and advertising expense increase. During the third quarter we entered into new agreements with our third party clearing brokers which resulted in a reduction in transaction and other clearing cost. Third party clearing cost as a percentage of Open Trading revenue declined from 22% in the first half of the year to 10% in the third quarter. At current volume levels, the annual savings amounts to approximately $4 million. Approximately half of the $2.2 million sequential decline in expenses was due to the impact of the stronger dollar. The reduction in third party clearing costs and lower variable incentive provision accounted for the remainder of the sequential expense decline. On Slide 11 we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30 were $332 million and trailing 12-months free cash flow reached a record $124 million. During the third quarter we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $10 million and repurchased 52,000 shares at a cost of $8.5 million under our share buyback program. In October, the board of directors authorized a $50 million increase to the share repurchase program. Based on the third quarter results, our board has approved a $0.26 regular quarterly dividend payable on November 23 to record holders on November 9. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Richard McVey: Thank you, Tony. Our third quarter results reflect continued growth in core U.S. credit products and an expanding footprint internationally. Open Trading solutions continue to gain momentum with dealers and investors. We see significant opportunities ahead as global credit market participants cope with a growing set of new regulatory requirements. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. You may begin.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Question on block trades. I don’t think you guys addressed, it was in your slide presentation, but I know there was some coverage of your block trade market share growth over the past year. Curious how that progressed during the third quarter and what you are seeing there that makes you positive about the outlook.
Richard McVey: Sure. Thanks, Patrick. For the full quarter, our block trading percentage of what was reported to [indiscernible] trades continued to be around 9%. So it's still a very healthy total in terms of the block trades that we are in the middle of. It wasn’t dramatically different from the second quarter. And remember, the third quarter increase in issuance versus Q3 of last year drove a lot of the block trading activity in the first weeks after issuance and much of that trading continues to be conducted through the underwriters. But we are, as you know, continue to invest very heavily in the protocols around block trading. We are encouraged by what we see in terms of the interest and acceptance of the those and we are optimistic that we can continue to grow share in that category.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it. Thanks. And the a quick one for Tony here. So Tony, when you renegotiate these clearing contracts for open trading, I am sure they are not just giving you a lower rate because you are good guy. Is there any sort of give back that the clearing firms are benefitting from or is there clearly just a one way better deal for you guys.
Antonio DeLise: To be honest, it was a conclusion of a process. We did evaluate third party clearing alternatives. We did go out with an RFP process. We ended up executing these new agreements and what ended up happening, it was a significant reduction to ticket fee, you know the clearing cost. And going forward there is a chance that we can drive down those clearing costs further. Under these agreements there are some volumes break points. We are not there yet. But we will continue to try and drive these costs down. And prospectively what you saw in the third quarter, I mentioned that clearing costs as a percentage of Open Trading revenue was around 10%. And in the near term think about it in that range, in that 10% or 11% or 12% range prospectively. And again chance to drive it down further as volumes picks up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may begin.
Kyle Voigt: I just had a question on the commentary around the muni offering and updates there. I think you launched some additional functionality last month in the muni space specifically. I guess are you seeing any early signs of client uptakes with those protocols specifically. And then just a similar question on the leverage loan, the multi-dealer product that launched earlier this month. Just wondering if you can give any color on the very early days of that launch and the client feedback thus far.
Antonio DeLise: Kyle, on the muni side, it is a continuing process. So we are continuing to add clients, to on board dealers, to get permissions in place. We are continuing to build out the functionality and we do have -- this time we have the full suite of protocols up and running, disclose request for quote, market list, open trading access, they are up and running now. And we are encouraged by the uptake, we just exceeded $1 billion for the year in muni trading. We are seeing bigger and bigger days across the platform and broader participation. So we are encouraged. Having said that, it's still a process. It's still early in the launch. We are still working through permissioning. We will continue to make enhancements. We are listening to clients. But we are encouraged by the early results here.
Kyle Voigt: Then just on the leveraged loan product as well.
Antonio DeLise: On the leverage loan it's brand new, so we are just a couple of weeks into the launch. And this one, we have talked about it before. This one really is an extension of what we are doing in the high yield market. It's generally the same traders and liquidity providers in the high yield market are also running loan books. Early days, we will have more to report in the upcoming quarters but just think about it as an extension of high yield right now.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And then sorry if I missed this, but just on the tax rate. I was wondering if you could quantify the impact of the onetime or non-recurring items. I guess related to the completion of the audit for last year's financials.
Antonio DeLise: Yes, on the tax rate, there was a little bit of noise in the third quarter but the better way of looking at the tax rate, if you think about last year's tax rate was 35%. Right now we are tracking it close to 34%. And I would say the one time piece of it, we did have one of these cycle audits from the IRS. So multi-year cycle audit. And the annual impact from that favorable outcome is about 0.1 to the effective tax rate. For the quarter it was bigger. It was about 0.5 but if you think about it on an annual basis, it's about 0.1. So basically it's not really moving the tax rate. And the bigger influences on the tax rate really are the income mix between U.S. and foreign because it's such a huge delta between the tax rates here in the U.S. and the tax rates outside of the U.S. When I say huge delta, think about the U.S. as roughly 40% and outside of the U.S. is roughly 20%. So what really drives that tax rate is that income mix. Short answer on the one time, little bit of an effect on the third quarter, full year very very small.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. And last one from me is really just I want to touch on the competitive landscape. A large exchange that currently doesn’t have a significant offering in the cash corporate bond space has recently talked about getting into the business. And then separately Bloomberg News reported that some of the dealer, investors in Tradeweb were considering selling their stakes. So can you just talk about these two recent developments, the potential impact on the competitive environment, given that both could create competitors with little dealer influence. And lastly, if there is anything that you believe MarketAxess needs to do ahead of this. Thanks.
Richard McVey: Sure. I will be happy to take that one. Listen, you have heard us say for years now that we think the global credit trading opportunity is a very large one. And in our estimate the adoption rates are accelerating, you see solid growth across products. So it would only be natural that large exchanges would be interested in our space. So we are not at all surprised by that. We expect competition to continue to grow and we are doing everything we know of to continue to invest so that our market position strengthens, which in the case of year-to-date results we believe that has been the case. So very very large market opportunity and none of us would be surprised to see investments by exchanges and others continue. With respect to the media reports on Tradeweb which I assume you are referring to, we are not in possession of any information beyond what all of you have read in the media. The only thing I would say on that is that there has been a multiyear trend of dealers exiting trading venues and multi-dealer consortiums. Two recent examples of that would be [market and batch] [ph]. So we have seen this take place over years so it wouldn’t be a surprise that those discussions are going on but beyond that we really don’t know anything about it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Christ Shutler with William Blair. You may begin.
Christopher Shutler: First, could you maybe just review the comments on the high-grade variable transaction fee per million. Again, I think it was flat quarter-over-quarter, about 189, which is meaningfully below where it has been the last few years but I know consistent with Q2. Just trying to gauge how sustainable that current level is. Thanks.
Antonio DeLise: So, Chris, the fee capture was really flat compared to the second quarter. There was no bunch of pluses and minuses there. So you had maybe years to maturity was a little lower and yield wasn’t higher and some protocol mix, but the pluses and minuses negated each other. And I am not sure I heard what you said but you are looking at fee capture over the past three years. I mean this is what we reported here, 189 is actually the highest we have recorded in the past three years in terms of fee capture. It's difficult to predict where this fee capture is going because it's duration based, trade size matter, dealer mix matters, floating rate note activity matters, the protocol matters. So it's tough to predict where this fee capture will go but we look at years to maturity which is a big influence. Where we are right now, it's smacked at in the middle of the post-crisis range of 7.5 to 10-years. Yields are still low. Our all variable plan dealers are still winning trades. But there is so much that influences that it's hard to predict where it's going to end up.
Christopher Shutler: Okay. Fair enough. And in open trading it looks like the number of market list responses jumped meaningfully in the quarter. Kind of similar to what you saw back in Q1. I think back then the explanation was there was one client that rolled out an auto-responding to tool to respond to prices. Was it the same type of thing here? Was this like an algorithmic trading firm or an ETF market maker? I am just trying to better understand what drove the growth there.
Richard McVey: You know across the entire system we are seeing a significant increase in the investment in automated trading. And we think this is a very positive development in terms of the likely growth and adoption of electronic trading in general and arguably the velocity of trading in credit markets. And when you look at the investment is taking place on both sides. Investors are working very hard to digest an automate more data and trading information from our platform and dealers are investing very heavily, both traditional dealers and new market making firms as well. So we see this as a very positive development and that is certainly a contributor to the large jump in price responses that you see during the third quarter.
Christopher Shutler: Okay. Thanks. And then just one last one. A lot of the banks put up pretty good [FIC] [ph] numbers this quarter. A lot of that may not be related to bonds but just wanted to get your take on that dynamic and how it played out into your results.
Richard McVey: I don’t think that there has been a strong co-relation of the two but the bank results were very good year-over-year. In the third quarter a couple of things that we hear anecdotally, you heard us talk about what was a very good quarter in new issuance for the credit markets. That’s a bit unusual during the summer months but almost a 30% increase year-over-year in new issuance and underwriting revenues. There was also, post-Brexit there was more volatility in certain markets, most notably foreign exchange and then you had a pretty good quarter for spread tightening. So credit books including loans would have seen better valuations throughout the quarter. So I think all of that contributed and it's great to see the good results in the dealer community.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. You may begin.
Rich Repetto: Just a couple small items here. Your comp went down, the comp ratio went down. Was that due to the sterling/dollar FX rate? And the same on the revenue side, the info on post -- you might have mentioned this, info on post-trade services, revenue ticked down.
Antonio DeLise: Rich, on the comp ratio, not really FX related or all that FX related. Because for us folks both the revenue and expense numbers were impacted. So really that’s not what driving it down. You know what you saw on the comp ratio, when we have a variable incentive bonus accrual it's tied directly to operating performance. When you see that top line revenue number down $5 million or $6 million quarter to quarter, it drives that formula driven provision lower and that’s really the principal driver. And on the information on post-trade, Rich, I don’t know if you are asking about year-over-year or sequential but...
Rich Repetto: Sequential.
Antonio DeLise: Yes. So you look at on a sequential basis, two factors there. And this exchange rate change has been significant. If you look at post-Brexit, when you look at for us we have 35 million sterling in revenue, roughly 35 million sterling in expenses. And when you look at the big movement from the second quarter was 1.43 sterling to dollar. Third quarter was 1.31 and honestly in the fourth quarter, looking at October, it's down another step function down to 1.22. So a big chunk of that information in post-trade decline was FX related. And the other piece and we had some comments in response to a question on the second quarter call about the composition of our information in post-trade revenue. About two-thirds of it is data, most of that is subscription driven but some of it is one-time data sales and then about a third of it is post-transaction reporting in trade matching which is tied to volume. So there is some dynamics there. And in the second quarter these onetime data sales were higher in the second quarter than the third quarter. It's not a big piece of the revenue driver but it was higher in the second quarter. So when you add up the FX and the one time data sales, those were the principal reasons for the decline.
Rich Repetto: Okay. That’s helpful. And just one quick follow up and it's a follow up from the question that was just asked to you Rick on the dealer, the big bank, good quarters in FIC. And I am just being new to [them] [ph]. Just trying to, you went to a number of things but in general when the dealers do well, could you go through some of the items on how the strength like bigger balance sheets and the dealers or at least more profitability impacts your model?
Richard McVey: You know I don’t know that we have a specific metric around that and I don’t think there has been a lot of co-relation between FIC dealer results and our own results over time. I think one of the big stories for us though is what we are seeing from the dealer community in terms of the significant increase in investment for automation of credit market making, and that’s really working its way across the industry which tells us that they are preparing for growth in electronic trading and they are seeing the benefits of efficiency in their trading model by doing things more electronically. And that’s a huge theme, as you know if they can manage more trading velocity at a lower cost and more efficiently, it's in keeping with their overall strategic goals. And I think that was the key theme from our perspective in the third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Hugh Miller with Macquarie. You may begin.
Hugh Miller: Just wanted to start off with a couple of housekeeping questions, if I could. Tony, I think you mentioned that the fixed rate fees for U.S. high grades were up a little bit quarter-over-quarter because of one dealer change there. And was the dealer included for the full quarter, should we be thinking about this particular fixed rate fee capture into Q4? Should there be any other adjustments there? And historically when we have seen some changes in the program, there has sometimes been an offset in terms of variable fee capture to make it, I guess, more revenue neutral. Is that the case here or should we not be thinking about it that way?
Antonio DeLise: So, Hugh, on this one dealer that did move between fee plans, and they moved from what we call the all variable plan to the distribution fee plan. It did happen at the beginning of the quarter. So you are seeing that full impact. For U.S. high grade, right now we are not -- we have got 29 dealers on the major plan and the distribution fee plan. We are not tracking anything at this particular time. So thinking about sort of forward guidance for the fourth quarter for that item, we are not expecting any big change right now. And I will tell you, on this particular dealer it was about revenue neutral. The impact in the quarter variable transactions fees declined and distributions fees went up. As we have grown, the impact of these dealers movements on fee capture has diminished. So as we have grown volumes and variable transaction fees, a single dealer moving impacts those fees per million by $2 or $3 right now. So it's just not that big of a influence when we see that kind of transition taking place.
Hugh Miller: Got it. That’s very helpful. And one other housekeeping. I definitely appreciate the insight on the clearing costs and helping to quantify that as we think about on the a go-forward basis. Obviously 2016 was a bit of an unusual year in terms of some investments in the business but they all let us some new products. I guess as you guys consider the budgets for next year, aside from kind of the benefit on the clearing cost side, are there any other unusual costs we should consider as we think about 2017?
Antonio DeLise: Hugh, it's a little early to start to talking about the expectations for next year. And I always tell people that history of the good guy. In this case if you look at historical expense growth, it's been 10% or 11%. You are right, this year 2016, over the past five years I would say. But I did tell you thematically that we are going to continue to invest where -- we think it's important to invest now. We think it's important to expand our addressable market, add products to expand geographic reach so we are going to continue on that, continue on that let's say. And I would say the one, and this is the small stuff, but the one sort of discrete item that we are tracking is around occupancy expense where we are flat out space here. In New York we are taking out some additional expansion space next month. Having said that, if we look at the occupancy line, it's $4 million on annual basis that’s a couple of percent of our expense. So it's not a big number but there is somewhat of a step function over the next several years in occupancy expenses.
Hugh Miller: Okay. That’s helpful. And then obviously we have seen some very strong industry growth this year in U.S. high grade for trending up significantly, a nice benefit. As we look at kind of what we have seen so far in October, I guess it hasn’t kind of continued. I think we have seen just tracking a little bit lower in terms of ADV for the industry for both high grade and high yield. Can you just provide us a little bit of, I guess, market color as to what you are seeing there and I know you have mentioned some data points on your expectation for your share for the month, I didn’t capture that. If you could just kind of repeat that, that would be great.
Richard McVey: Sure. On market volumes, this is a positive sign over the last two or three quarters that were actually for the first time in four years or so seeing an uptick in market turnover. And I think it's a great sign and I think it reflects that investors and dealers are adopting to the new regulatory environment and finding new ways to move risk. And you have heard us say before, Hugh, that with the massive growth that we have seen in the corporate debt markets, if we can get market turnover back to more normal long-term levels, it would result in a 30% or 40% increase in TRACE volumes. So this is the beginning of a market adopting to the regulatory changes and finding new ways to get business done in trade and we would be optimistic that the trend in market volumes could be higher. The one thing we don’t know is that the direction of rates and the new issue calendar. Clear the large new issue activity over the last four years has driven a lot of secondary volume. The expectation is that if the Fed raises rates it will be very gradual over the next 18 months, so I don’t see that changing much. But if the environment were to change for new issue activity, the components of secondary market volume would likely be lower. But I still think we are dealing with global credit markets that are so much larger than they were five years ago, that is as we deliver more and more connectivity to that market and efficiency in electronic trading we would be optimistic that there is plenty of room for turnover to grow.
Hugh Miller: Very helpful. And if you could just, I guess, reiterate some of the color you provided in the prepared remarks on the market share and where that’s expected to fall out in October?
Antonio DeLise: Yes, Hugh in the prepared remarks I said that right now high grade and high yield market share is tracking below the third quarter but well above October of last year. And third quarter market share for high grade was 16%, for high yield was 7%. We said it's tracking below that but one above last year. And you will recall last year for U.S. high grade market share was 12.6%. It was a bit of a strange month. There are a number of storied bonds and very high new issuance and our market share reflected some of that activity. So we are expecting a significant increase over that year. I would tell you what, one other thing. We look at, as best we can measure market share across our four core products, high trade, high yield, emerging market and Eurobonds. And so what we are tracking for market volumes is tough to get at but when we look at market share on a composite basis for October so far, it's very close. The ones identical to where the composite share was for the third quarter. So there is some pluses and minuses in there. You see the tremendous progress that we have made in emerging markets that progress is continuing. On the market share story, there is also four days left. So it's tough to predict exactly when we are going to come out, right now it's tracking a little bit below the third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Unidentified Analyst: His is [Ryan Sparto] [ph] filling in for Ashley Serrao. Just wondering if you could discuss a little bit how you view the growth prospects for your data business?
Richard McVey: I would be happy to take that one. You know the data revenues were not quite as robust in growth as they were in the second quarter. Having said that, I think we had a very strong quarter for developments in our data product area and we have been investing very heavily, as you have heard us mention, in the past in real time data capabilities in Europe, in particular through Axess All. And there were a number of improvements made that really kind of allow clients to customize our trade tape and have highly relevant real time price and spread and volume data. And we are seeing growing use of that with large dealers as well as investors to help them understand market risk and liquidity risk. We expect that the demand for those products will continue to grow, so it's not as enormous contribution to the overall company earnings currently but we see ways to grow that revenue and earnings base. And we always think about data product in two ways. One, what products can we actually earn revenue in selling either through our web products or through APIs to our clients. But equally important, how can we enhance the value of the trading platform for our clients with the data that we integrate into the trading system. And with Axess All and Trax data combined with the enhanced TRACE data, all fully integrated, we feel really good that we are giving dealers and investors the benefit of the best real time data available in credit products. So that is certainly contributing to the trading volume growth that we have seen. So long way of saying over the years we see a bigger opportunity in data. That’s an area of investment for us and we think we had a pretty good quarter in terms of enhancing the quality of the products that we deliver.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the detail there if I can have a follow up question. Would you be able to discuss your views on capital management given current cash on the books?
Antonio DeLise: Sure, Ryan. On the capital management side we have always had this philosophy of having a strong balance sheet and we would like to add operating flexibility that it give us. And it allows us to act opportunistically if something does it right. That current dividend program, we are targeting paying out right around a third of free cash flow and a third of earnings. If you look at the trailing 12-months, we are probably paying out right around 30% right now. And that repurchase program we have had in place, it's serving the intended purpose. It's a repurchase program to offset the dilution from employee equity grants. You look at the last four years on the repurchase side, we have granted roughly 1 million shares in options and we have repurchased roughly 1 million. So again, we have got sort of programmatic plan in place. I would tell you right now there is no current plans to change that capital return policy. We do revisit that policy every quarter with the board, if you look back in history you will see we do have changing the dividend or adjusting the dividend in the beginning of the year, that will be another discussion with the board. And I know that dividend was no secret and we have been transparent about this. As free cash flow and earnings increase, we are ratcheting up that dividend. We increased it 50% in 2015, we increased it 60% in 2016. So we are increasing that dividend. But right now no plans to change.
Operator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Richard McVey: Thanks very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, July 28, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
David Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. This morning we reported strong second quarter results, driven by record trading volumes. Second quarter revenues were a record at $97 million, up 28% compared to the second quarter 2015. Record pre-tax income for the quarter was $51 million, up 36% from a year ago, and diluted EPS was a record $0.88, also up 38%. Record trading volume of $338 billion, up 38% from a year ago, were driven by a powerful combination of market share gains across all four of our core products and the near-record level of overall U.S. high-grade and high-yield TRACE market trading volumes. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share was 16.1% in the second quarter, up from 14.8% a year ago, and estimated high-yield market share was 7.1%, up from 5.4%. Open Trading adoption continues to accelerate and reached record volume and client participation in the second quarter. Volumes continue to benefit from transaction cost savings, and the number of market participants providing liquidity through open trading protocols continues to grow. Slide 4, provides an update on market conditions. Overall, second quarter market volumes remain elevated at near-record levels, with high-grade TRACE volumes of 17% and high-yield volumes of 12%, from a year ago. We believe the increase in trading activity in these markets reflects an active new issue calendar, higher credit spread volatility, and inflow into U.S. credit from global investors searching for yield. It is interesting to note that TRACE market volumes were both high-grade and high-yield in the first-half of this year are setting new records, while primary dealer holdings for market making continue to fall. This demonstrates that both dealers and investors have adjusted to the new regulatory environment and are finding new ways to transacting credit markets. This ongoing transformation is encouraging, as it could signal return to higher levels of secondary turnover for credit products, with a growing base of outstanding debt that now totals approximately $8.5 trillion for U.S. high-grade and high-yield products alone. Slide 5, provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volumes reached another record high of $41 billion in the second quarter. Over 93,000 all trades were completed during the quarter compared to 38,000 in Q2 2015. The number of unique liquidity providers or price makers on the platform continues to increase. In the second quarter, the list grew to 619 firms, up from 375 in Q2 a year ago. This expanding pool of participants help drive a 250% year-over-year increase in Open Trading price responses. In the second quarter of 2016, liquidity takers saved an estimated $27 million in transaction costs through Open Trading on the system. This quarter, U.S. high-grade open trades resulted in average savings of 4 basis points in yield, and high-yield trades resulted in average savings of $0.40, or a $4,000 per million trading. As the pool of participants grows in Open Trading, the transaction cost savings accelerate for our clients. We see the potential for further growth they had in Open Trading. Both dealers and investors need alternative sources of liquidity, and we’re in early days of market adoption for all trading. When we analyzed our most active clients on the system, about one-third are regular Open Trading price makers, about one-third are occasional price makers, and about one-third is yet to get started. We believe client option is likely to continue to improve. Slide 6, provides an update on Europe. Our European trading business continues its growth trajectory with a 100% year-over-year increase in trading volumes from European clients during Q2. We’re gaining Eurobond market share, as our 126% growth in Eurobond market volume far outpace the estimated growth in market volumes of a 11% reported through Trax. We’re also seeing healthy growth in trading volumes in emerging markets and U.S. credit products from European clients. The second quarter reflects a new high for client engagement with our platform. Active European client firms grew 25% year-over-year, and our cross-selling efforts are coming to fruition as the number of European firms traded three or more products with us was up 43% to 225 clients. Data revenue was up 22% from the second quarter of last year, as a result of the innovations and enhancements through our European data product set. Trax data is now integrated with the trading system offering clients differentiated price discovery that we expect to drive increased trading volume on the platform. We continue to enhance access all the first European trade ticker and we have launched value-added trade reporting and transaction cost analysis tools in support of buying trading activity. We’re pleased with the progress we’re making in expanding and deepening our presence with clients in the European region. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for more details on our financial results.
Antonio DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 7 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $1.89 billion for the quarter, representing a 27% increase from the second quarter of 2015, on a combination of the increase in estimated market share and higher TRACE volumes. Volumes in the Other Credit category were up 68%, as trading in Eurobond more than doubled year-over-year, and both emerging markets and U.S. high-yield volumes were up more than 45%. Similar to the U.S. high-grade and the Other Credit volume gains were due to combination of growth in estimated market share and an increase in market volumes. The second quarter marched our launch of trading in municipal bonds. And while it is early days, we are encouraged by the level of client participation. We have documented over 250 investor clients in almost 100 dealers, and over 160 firms have executed a TRACE since the launch. With two trading days left in July, we expect overall average daily trading volume will be slightly below second quarter levels, while the year-over-year volume growth rates versus July 2015, looks similar to the second quarter. We expect U.S. high-grade market share to be below the second quarter levels and U.S. high-yield market share to be above the second quarter level. On Slide 8, we provided summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue reached a record $97 million, up 28% from a year-ago. The record trading volumes led to a 30% year-over-year improvement in quarterly commission revenues. Information and post-trade services revenue increased almost 13% year-over-year on stronger data sales. Total expenses were $46 million, up 20% year-over-year. The quarterly and year-to-date expense growth rate exceeds our long-term compound annual growth rate, but also comes at a time when we are investing in people and systems to support our growth initiatives. Of note, at the same time, we are investing for the future, we also achieved a record operating margin of 52.3%. Subsequence to the Brexit, both the dollar strengthened significantly versus the pound sterling. If we implies the current foreign exchange rate to our first-half results, revenue and expenses would each have been approximately $2 million lower. The effective tax rate was 34.5% for the second quarter and the year-to-date tax rate fits within our full-year 2016 guidance range. Our diluted EPS was a record $0.88 on a diluted share count of 37.7 million shares. On Slide 9, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes, and fees per million. The 38% increase in trading volume and relatively flat overall fee capture led to a 39% year-over-year increase in variable transaction fees. Overall, distribution fees in the second quarter were consistent with the first quarter and prior year levels. Now, U.S. high-grade fee capture is influenced by a number of items, including the duration of bonds traded on the platform, trade size, and dealer fee plan mix. The $11 per million sequential increase in high-grade fee capture was primarily due to slightly higher years to maturity and lower yields for bond traded on the platform. Our Other Credit category fee capture is influenced by the product mix between Eurobond’s emerging markets and high-yield volume, mix within our product and product volumes. On a sequential basis, the fee captured for the individual product was fail. The $6 per million sequential decline in fee capture was due almost entirely to a mix shift between products, as the growth in emerging markets in Eurobond outpaced the growth in high-yield trading volume. Slide 10, provides you with the expense detail. The majority of the $7.7 million year-over-year increase in expenses was due to higher compensation and benefits costs. Salary and employer taxes and benefits were up $3 million, and reflect the rise in headcount and wage rate increases effective the first of the year. Our headcount increased by $56 year-over-year with a vast majority sitting in technology and customer facing positions. The variable bonus accrual, which is tied record operating performance was $1.7 million higher. Several important infrastructure projects are driving the year-over-year growth in professional and consulting fees, and the increase in third-party clearing cost associated with the growth in Open Trading accounts the variance in general and administrative expenses. Even the growing momentum in the business and expectation that we will invest in additional staff over the second-half of the year, we’re updating our full-year 2016 expense guidance, and now believe, expenses will range from $178 million to $183 million. The timing of the expected headcount increase, level of performance-based variable incentive compensation, and foreign currency movements between the dollar and pound sterling, among other items could cause variations in the expense outcome. On Slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of June 30, were $300 million, and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached $105 million. During the second quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $10 million and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $4.2 million under our share buyback program. As of June 30, approximately $20 million was available for future repurchases under the program. We have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. Based on the second quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.26 regular quarterly dividend, payable on August 25, to record holders on August 11. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Richard McVey: Thank you, Tony. Our second quarter results reflect accelerating adoption rates for e-trading and credit products, combined with strong market volumes. This momentum continues in Europe, and we believe, we are on the right track for more meaningful earnings contribution from the region. Open Trading and leading the charge were alternative sources of liquidity in credit markets through all trading. Operating leverage is readily apparent in our business model, as top line revenue growth drives attractive earnings momentum. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open, sir.
Christopher Shutler: Hey, guys, good morning.
Richard McVey: Hi, Chris. I look forward [ph].
Christopher Shutler: Thanks. So, first, on the high-yield market share gains. I mean, they’ve been really strong now for a few quarters in a row, Open Trading really seems to be shining there. So I know it’s a market that’s even more liquidity-constrained than high-grade, there are few dealers. So maybe just walk us through what you think has been going on in high-yield over the last few quarters? And to what extent, do you think the pickup is – pickup and share is attributable to ETF market makers, and what’s going on ETF market?
Richard McVey: Sure, happy to take that, Chris. I think it’s a combination of factors. First, as you pointed out, high-yield is a less liquid product area, and arguably an area where Open Trading can add even more value. And you see that coming through in the transaction cost savings numbers that I mentioned in the prepared remarks today, which are quite meaningful to our clients. And, in fact, there are many open trades that we complete, where the initial increase does not recede any dealer responses. So what we’re seeing is the less liquids, the product area happens to be the more value client see in Open Trading. And we think there’s no doubt, that’s part of what’s driving the high-yield market share increases. As we’ve also said in prior calls and as you point out, growth in ETF is aligned with our business model, because the vast majority of ETF market participants transact most of their volume electronically. So, as we continue to see the shift toward ETF assets under management, it does improve the market share results in high-yield and other products. So that undoubtedly is another contributing factor to the strong gains in high-yield market share. And finally, I think the third factor is just growing participation. We talk extensively about the cross-selling efforts that we have in a company to make sure that, clients would have historically seen good results and benefits from high-grade trading, are doing the same in EM and high-yield and now in Eurobond. So the third factor is, we just have many more clients trading high-yield today than we did a year ago.
Christopher Shutler: Okay, make sense, thanks. And then, Rick, I’m just stepping back, I mean, how is MarketAxess working to address the pre-trade transparency issue, which I know is a top in mind for a lot of people. I mean, it seems to me that even in Open Trading, the dealers are a very integral part of that. Ecosystem on the buy-side for the most part isn’t ready to start making prices without receiving quotes from the dealers, you just mentioned maybe not at all time, particularly in high-yield, but just – maybe give me your thoughts there on how you are going to address that issue?
Richard McVey: Sure. Two to things things I would point out. First, we were the first trading platform to fully integrate TRACE data into our high-grade platform that date back to 02 when TRACE started. We’ve now obviously done that for a high-yield as well. So, all available TRACE prints are fully visible free trade to all dealers and clients on the platform. Secondly, we have worked very hard over the last 12 to 18 months to enhance the European system with Trax data. And this was one of the primary benefits in acquiring Trax a little over three years ago is being able to deliver price discovery tools to our dealer, investor clients directly on the trading platform. So all available regulatory trade reports are now integrated with the trade system in the U.S. through TRACE and in Europe through Trax. The final piece is, we’re aggregating all data sources that we have to just play a composite price across more and more credit securities that is also available free trade. So we had a growing base of data because of the growing market share on the trading platform, and we combine that with the TRACE and Trax data and quotes that are available on the system and we create a composite price that is designed to help investors and dealers to have a starting point from where the mid-market is likely to be in a host of credit securities.
Christopher Shutler: Gotcha. And then last one, if you breakdown your market share gains into subcategory, so I don’t know how you do it less than a $1 million, somewhere between $1.5 and then over the block trades. How would we see those market share gains trending by different buckets. Is there any color there on where the growth is coming from, would help?
Antonio DeLise: Chris, this is Tony.
Christopher Shutler: Hi, Tony.
Antonio DeLise: On the market share gains whether you’re looking by year-over-year, where we take that market share in high-grade year-over-year or you look at it sequentially, regardless of how you look at it. We are taking up market share across all size buckets. And quite honestly, where it was more noticeable sequentially was in TRACE size is $1 million no trades and block trades. That’s where it was more noticeable, but we were – we are taking up market share across all categories. And we had that ability with high-grade a little bit to a lesser extent with high-yield to get more granular. But it is across all trade sizes.
Christopher Shutler: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick O’Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Your line is open, sir.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning, guys.
Richard McVey: Good morning, Patrick.
Antonio DeLise: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: So taking up on your comments to the last question and talking about block trading, as we look at the competitors that are out there and trying to make a push into the space. It seems like most of them are focused on the block trade and experience. Can you just talk about some more solutions that you are putting out there for block trading, and maybe how they’re differentiated versus some of these competitors?
Richard McVey: I’m happy to – it’s been a large area of investment for us over the last six to nine months to enhance our Open Trading protocols with solutions that are designed to limit information leakage for dealers and investors for block trades. And we are seeing growing usage of both client access and private access. Client access allows dealers or investors to post access to the community that they would like to on the platform. The good news in the second quarter, as we saw growing usage of client access from the dealer community as an efficient way to get there, trade access and indications out to their clients. We’re now increasingly using watch list electronic notifications on the system to identify potential trade matches. Private access that something we rolled out during the second quarter and it’s very early stages, but it allows investors or dealers to avail their order broader with the system in a completely private play, so that no ones see those – sees those orders, thus we can identify and match for them. So obviously the goal there is to fully eliminate information leakage while allowing clients and dealers to close their access to try to identify a natural match of the other side of the trade. So the benefit here is that we continue believe that we have the broadest menu of Open Trading protocol in the business and importantly the biggest network of clients. So we are around a 110 active investor and dealer clients on the platform and it is that rest of participation that creates the content that gives us a much better chance to identifying matches at any of our competitors. So I think it’s a combination of the – continuing investments that we’re making in thoughtful protocols with the direct feedback from our clients and dealers and the vast network of active clients that we have on the MarketAxess system.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it, that’s helpful. And then follow-up for me, we saw really a nice sequential increase in your information post-trade services revenues. And it sounds like you’re getting some traction with your market data revenues over in Europe. What are your expectations for that going forward? Do you think that this is still of their early stages of kind of go in that as a revenue line item?
Antonio DeLise: Patrick, it’s a good question. And just taking a step back of information in post-trade, it’s just a refresh of these memory, about two-thirds of that revenue is data related. So both U.S. and UK data products and about third of that line item is post-trade transaction reporting and matching, which is really tied to fixed income and equity market volume. Where we saw the growth is in the data side and a lot of that was Trax driven, something out of Europe. The new contract volume in the first-half of the year was greater than all of 2015. So we do see some traction there. We’ve had some Trax volume, pricing, composite pricing, access to all, reference data, those were all contributing to the uplift. So that data revenue, I will caution that it is the combination of subscription revenue, and also it’s one-time revenue. So there are historical dataset that we sell that will drive one-time revenue and that – because of that, it’s a little bit difficult to predict quarter-to-quarter where that revenues going. But I will tell you, we feel – we do feel better today and we’re more optimistic about – of that that line item, about our data business, about our post-trade business. So we do think that that we are in a better position than we’ve been in before and you’re seeing it coming through with what we just posted in second quarter.
Richard McVey: Yes, and Patrick, as you know, we think about the benefits of quality data in two ways. One is the discrete data revenue opportunity that Tony outlined. The other is just making our trading platform much more valuable for our clients. And just in the last three weeks or so, we have released a new market summary page with real-time data from our Trax reporting and matching business that is now that the homepage for our European trading platform. And it is drawing a lot of client and dealer interest because it’s the best real-time price discovery tool available for European fixed income and there we see the benefit there coming through in more clients trading on the platform and growing trading volumes. So I think there is two ways that we’re extracting value from the investment that we’re making data, one in discrete revenue and the other is that a meaningful contribution to the growth in our trading volumes.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it, that’s helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Richard McVey: Good morning, Kyle.
Kyle Voigt: Good morning. So Eurobond activity, which one I say in Europe, I guess. So Eurobond activity is up substantially, and it seems that large portion of the growth here is just simply market share gains. So just wondering if you give us some more colors to where you believe those market share gains are coming from? Is it primarily from taking the share from competitor electronic platforms or is there also growth in electronic penetration in those markets in general?
Antonio DeLise: It’s really hard to determine Kyle, because we don’t really see discrete trading data from most of our competitors because we are private companies and they don’t provide volume and financial data in the same way that we do. Anecdotally, we think it’s probably from taking share from clients. Having said that, we’re so optimistic that there is plenty of room for the Eurobond and European fixed income e-share to grow. And I think the place where we think the e-share is probably most obviously growing in Europe is through emerging markets, where client adoption in both foreign currency external that as well as local market is growing. And as I mentioned earlier that’s been a big contributor for us in the growth that we see in our European business.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Thank you. I did want to turn to expenses real quick, but just looks like your – the guidance implies a quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year at a level that lower in the 2Q expense level? Tony, is it fair to say, there is a bit of a true up in bonus comp in the second quarter?
Richard McVey: No, Kyle, no, so…
Kyle Voigt: Okay.
Antonio DeLise: We did up tick the expense guidance here. And you can see where the variances were in the first-half of the year in comp and benefits, and professional and consulting and then the third-party clearing costs. And when you look at that midpoint now of the new guidance range, it’s up around $8 million from our midpoint of our prior guidance range, those big deltas in there. A lot of it is comp and benefits. No true up in the second quarter, a lot of it is comps and benefits related. We’re hiring at a faster clip. The attrition rate that we’ve experienced – has been lower than what we had originally budgeted. The incentive accrual is running higher than where we were last year and higher than what we budgeted that’s all in the back of the improved revenue performance. Professional and consulting side, that’s where there is that – there is a bit of a delta and we do expect that continue in the second-half of the year. We got a number of infrastructure projects underway to support our growth, and things like new accounting system, new HR system, new middle and back office system, new CRM system. So we’re in the middle of – a number of implementations right now. Yes, I tell you one thing, I had in the prepared remarks that I do even with the range we provided. There is some variability in there, because we just can’t predict where – in particular where the FX’s rates going to go. We can’t predict firmly where the variable incentive compensations going to come out and while we definitely have hiring plan, which is start to predict exactly when those bodies will come onboard, so it remains some sensitivity in there.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. I actually had a follow-up on just – I guess the expenses you mentioned, the – there is a clearing arrangement. I think you have with purging for the Open Trading, trades for MarketAxess as the counterparty? I believe that that’s all variable in terms of the cost that you paid a purging based on your Open Trading revenue? So I guess can you give us an update on whether or not you’re evaluating any alternative options that maybe better for MarketAxess and from a cost perspective versus the current arrangement?
Antonio DeLise: Yes, so Kyle, you’re right. We – right now we do clear through a third-party clearing broker and right now – and we’re pretty transparent on costs and we’re pretty transparent on the Open Trading revenues. Right now, you see third-party clearing cost were running around 20% or 21% of our Open Trading revenues. We are looking at different clearing alternatives and ways are being more efficient and I tell you longer-term, we don’t believe that the cost was scaled the way they have or the way they – what you see in the results. We do believe that we can drive down the per-ticket fee and we can drive down those clearing cost as a percentage of both trading revenue. It’s an ongoing process. We’re looking at clearing arrangements. We’re looking at things like tough clearing, which maybe longer – the longer path. But we do believe that, while it may take sometime to realize some of these benefits, we do think to run a path longer term to driving down those expenses.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, thanks. I’ll get back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Adams of Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Mike Adams: Good morning, gentlemen, how are you doing?
Richard McVey: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Adams: So the question on pricing. I think, earlier this month you guys introduced some pricing changes around Open Trading been quite a while since you’ve modified pricing in anyway. So just kind of curious if you could walk us through why you’re making the changes now, especially just given the really rapid growth in Open Trading? And if you could also outline any changes in customer activity that you’ve seen here early days?
Richard McVey: Yes, in early days, it’s the right point, Mike. We’re assessing the value that we deliver to clients in Open Trading. We’re assessing competitor levels, as new models have rolled out. We’re also assessing the different levels of participation that we see from clients and wanting to make sure that we have room to provide incentives for those clients that are most active providing new liquidity into the system in the marketplace. So, because this is all in such early days, we will continue to tweak pricing and try to end up in exactly the right spot, where we’ve got a long-term scalable revenue model. And the modest changes that we made recently are in line with that, that’s not material in terms of the total fee capture for Open Trading or the system, or just in early days of refining and tweaking the pricing models for Open Trading.
Mike Adams: Got it. And so like a couple of other housekeeping items here. Tony, when you were discussing the data revenue earlier, you mentioned that sometimes one-time revenue items can move the quarter-to-quarter, were any of those realized in 2Q?
Antonio DeLise: Mike, some of them was in Q2. And I would say that, the majority of what you’re seeing in terms of revenue growth would be more subscription-related or sustainable, but there was a portion of that Q2 revenue growth, which will be one-time. Having said that, every quarter we have some element of that going. But the majority of the increase should be able – more of a sustainable nature.
Richard McVey: I just add one thing, Mike. One thing that I’m really encouraged about is that, when we look at the early subscribers or our enhanced data products in Europe from Trax, they’re the largest most sophisticated players in the credit markets. So the fact that they’re seeing value and once the subscribers in those data products gives me great confidence that this will be a growing area for our data revenue in the quarters and years ahead.
Mike Adams: Got it. Got it, thanks. And are you exclusively charging for the majority of the data revenue now, as I know, some of it just helps to grow your transaction business. What’s the mix today?
Richard McVey: Mike, there’s some – in some cases we’re doing, and soft dollar might be the wrong word, but in some cases, we’re trading on the platform. We do provide access to data. What we’re reporting is the hard dollar revenues we’re reporting in our results. But quite frankly, we – it’s promoting more of a velocity on the platform. We can do that by providing data, that’s the path we’ll go down. It’s a more valuable. The trading revenue is a more valuable stream for us.
Mike Adams: Okay. And Tony one last question for you, this is we’re thinking about expenses this year and whether we come in at the high-end or low-end of the range. One of the big factors, obviously, is going to be the incentive comp. Would you be able to give us that number for 2015, and then where the accruals are in the first-half of 2016, just to help us frame it?
Antonio DeLise: Mike, I could, but I’m not going to. But let’s – I’ll study about it. We’re – in this case, we’re beyond transparent. I’ll let you do a little bit of where you can pull open our proxy statement. We do spell out exactly how the expense is going to accrual. It’s a very simple – some very simple math behind it. It’s a percentage of pre-tax pre-bonus income find its way into the intensive bonus accrual. And it’s – there’s no magic or mystery to how that accrual builds throughout the year.
Richard McVey: To add, Mike, I just expand on that to say, look, our tremendous business growth is benefiting all of our constituents. We’re hiring a lot more people to support future growth in existing and new products. We’re expanding margins for our shareholders and we’re investing more actively than we ever had before for our clients. So, it’s really the results that are driving the – our ability to invest and provide more value to all three of those constituents. But remember, fortunately, the increase in the bonus accrual this year is, because we have a lot more people here. And for all the right reasons, we’re building more technology solutions than ever before, and we have more clients and more products to cover than ever before. So it’s – we’re very pleased that we’re able to invest as actively as we’re because of the tremendous results the business has been consistently achieving.
Mike Adams: Got it. Tony, I actually have done a little homework on this, so maybe we can share some of it offline, but congrats gentlemen.
Richard McVey: I know, Mike, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Marcus Carney: Good morning, all. This is Marcus Carney, standing in for Ashley.
Richard McVey: Hi, Marcus.
Antonio DeLise: Hi, Marcus.
Marcus Carney: I just had a couple of questions. One, could you comment on the cross-currents in Europe kind of between the ECBs repurchase program and your efforts to increase liquidity on the European platform?
Richard McVey: Sure. ECB, as you know has been active over the last two or three months in their Corporate bond purchase program, as part of QE. And our estimates are consistent with what you’ve seen and other market reports. We think that it’s been averaging somewhere around 6% or 7% of Eurobond volume on average. So it’s an ongoing program. We said last quarter and I’ll repeat again that all levels equal, as it’s not positive for market turnover, because it’s our expectation that the ECB will buy and hold those bonds then it’s – they’re likely to be held until maturity. So whatever purchases they make are likely to be locked up on their balance sheet. Having said that it’s not currently an overly large part of the market. And we’re seeing a pretty significant transition in the way European investors think about e-trading. And we’re happy that, we’re out in front of this, and post-Brexit has been another example, where more significant European dealers are altering their business model, and not only carrying less inventory for market-making than they used to, but they have less people doing it. And as a result, the solutions that we’ve been delivering to European clients to give investors their choice of how broadly they want to send their order flow and complement the traditional deal liquidity with Open Trading solutions is really gaining momentum. And so, we’re excited about that transition, and we think that that factor is much more material than the ECB corporate bond purchase program that’s underway.
Marcus Carney: Excellent. Thank you. And then with respect to the new initiatives, the munis and the loans. I’m just curious first some color on kind of what early client feedback has been and where you see kind of pools of liquidity building?
Richard McVey: Yes, the client feedback is good. But as Tony mentioned in his prepared remarks, we’re in very early days. And every one of these products and the story has been the same. It’s – signing up a client is just the beginning, then the technology integration needs to take place. The trader training needs to take place. The behavioral change starts with orders from investors and price responses from dealers. And we’re on track with where we expected we would be in munis. We’re very pleased that we’ve got approximately 250 investors on-boarded and very close to a 100 muni dealers, 160 firms have utilized the muni system already in the second quarter. So it’s on track and we remain highly confident that the menu of technology solutions that we have successfully delivered for taxable credit products have wide application in the muni space. So it’s a – the second-half is more about continuing to move forward with on-boarding more clients and dealers and getting more orders in the system. And we remain optimistic that we can provide real value to our clients in the municipal market. On leverage loans, we expect to have a pilot version of our leverage loan product available sometime in the third quarter. That is likely to accommodate single dealer loan orders initially. And we would expect to have a multi-dealer product out sometime in Q4. So, again, another example of the investments that we’re making to broaden this – the sphere of opportunity that we have available for our shareholders and the product coverage that we have for our clients.
Marcus Carney: Excellent. Thank you very much for the color.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Hugh Miller of Macquarie. Your line is open.
Hugh Miller - Macquarie Group: Hi, good morning.
Richard McVey: Good morning, Hugh.
Antonio DeLise: Good morning, Hugh.
Hugh Miller: I appreciate taking my questions. I just wanted to touch a bit upon, I really appreciate some of the insights that you gave about adoption of Open Trading among top clients. As we think about kind of the third of your top clients that aren’t adopting at this point, what’s the feedback that you hear in terms of the challenges for them to kind of start to use Open Trading. And are there protocols that you can create that would help to improve that, or is it more a function of just kind of internal issues at the company that that need to be resolved?
Richard McVey: I think it’s entirely the latter. There is no feedback from clients that would suggest that we have any lack of solutions or protocols to accommodate Open Trading for any credit product in any trade size. It is a material change for investment managers, in my opinion, these are two key things that investors need to accomplish in order to participate actively in Open Trading. The first is the theme that exists between portfolio management and trading historically, where the orders are generated by portfolio managers and then, Hugh, driven orders are delivered to the trading desk, and those traders have the responsibility for achieving the best price on those orders. And as the world is changing, we see investors that are changing that trading process, so that they can be more opportunistic in responding to orders in bonds that look like the ones that portfolio manager would like to buy or sell, but may not be exactly the same bond in the same size. And the early adopters, you see that that communication and that trading process between portfolio managers and traders has become much more fluid. There’s more communication going on. In some cases you see, former traders becoming PMs or PM is becoming traders that there is more coordination between the portfolio management effort and trading at the firms that are now able to take advantage of the benefits of Open Trading. We see in our meetings that every firm is working on this, which is why we’re optimistic that a year from now. you’re going to see a much broader base of participants in Open Trading. The second factor is really around compliance and control, is that, many firms who have a very strict process around that order wider the trades that are conducted, the price delivery to their trade capture and compliance systems, making sure it complies with all the rules that they have in various discrete client portfolios. And there is technology work on their product to make sure that they adjust that trading process. It doesn’t break anything in their compliance and control functions. And that too is another area, where we see significant work going on with the buy-side. But it obviously does represent a change in their trading procedures.
Hugh Miller: Great. That’s very, very helpful, and so I appreciate it. And then, I guess, one other for me, just in terms of obviously early days with the muni initiative and I appreciate some of the update on the expectations for the roll out on leverage loans. As we think about the competitive landscape in munis, and you guys now kind of pushing out a product, are you seeing any change in kind of, from the competitors in terms of, of their product offering and whether or not, they’re trying to look at euro platform potentially trying to mimic services and things like that, or has there not been much of a change in the competitive landscape?
Richard McVey: We don’t see much of a change. I think as we mentioned in prior calls, we see a couple of things. We see messaging services available on the institutional market that are designed to help people try to find each other with then generally manual means of execution and post trade. And then as you know, there are three or four retail platforms that are active in munis. They generally have live levels available for trading, but in much smaller trade sizes and generally wider bid offer. So those are the two things that we see in a competitive landscape in minus, but we have not seen any real change in that picture. So we announced the – our plans to move into the muni market, say, three months ago.
Hugh Miller: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time I see no other questions in queue. I’d like to turn it to Mr. Rick McVey for any closing comments.
Richard McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-27 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - Investor Relations Manager Richard McVey - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Antonio DeLise - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Michael Adams - Sandler O’Neill & Partners Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Hugh Miller - Macquarie Group Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James Financial, Inc. Marcus Carney - Credit Suisse
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, April 27, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2016 results. This morning we reported record first quarter results, driven by record trading volumes and an acceleration of market share gains across each of our four core products of U.S. high-grade, U.S. high-yield, emerging markets and Eurobonds. First quarter revenues were a record $89 million, up 15% compared to Q1 2015. Record pre-tax income for the quarter was $44 million, up 15% from a year ago. And diluted EPS was up 18% to $0.77. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share was 14.9% in Q1, up from 13.7% a year ago. And estimated high-yield market share was 6.4%, up from 4.8%. We believe that share gains in Eurobonds and emerging market bonds were similar to the high-yield pace. Open Trading adoption accelerated and reached record volume and participation in the first quarter. Transaction cost savings continue to grow as Open Trading solutions identified more trade matching opportunities for our clients. Slide 4 highlights our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were $310 billion, up from $244 billion one year ago. We surpassed $5 billion in average daily trading volume in the first quarter, one quarter after reaching $4 billion in ADD [ph] for the first time. U.S. high-grade volumes were a record $178 million for the quarter, up 22% from the first quarter of 2015, on a combination of 1.2 percentage point increase in estimated market share and a 12% year-over-year improvement in estimated high-grade TRACE volume. Volume in the Other Credit category increased 43% year over year as trading in Eurobonds, high-yields and emerging market bonds, each achieved record quarterly levels. We are excited about our recent launch of municipal bond trading and the opportunity to deliver broader access to liquidity and greater efficiency to his highly fragmented market. Today, we have approximately 65 dealers and 200 investor clients onboarded to trade muni bonds and we expect this also [ph] to expand in the coming months. Based on MSRB data, we estimate the secondary trading in municipal bonds averages around $6 billion per day. We have implemented a tiered fee schedule based on maturity and trading value, and currently expect the fees per million traded will be between $350 and $400. With three trading days remaining in April, estimated high-grade market share is running above the first quarter level. Total average daily trading volume for April is similar to the first quarter 2016 level, while market volumes are slightly low. Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. Overall market volumes reported by trades hit record levels in the first quarter with high-grade volumes up 12% and high-yields volumes up 9% from a year-ago. The expansion of trading volume reflects the growing size of debt outstanding in the credit markets and the global demand for yield. Fixed income mutual funds fund-flow stabilized, while dealer inventories remained well below historical levels. Many dealers have scaled back their credit market making activities, while others have exited entirely. Our solutions are increasingly valuable in a market where the traditional providers of liquidity are adjusting to the constraints of new regulations and higher capital costs. Slide 6 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volumes more than doubled of year over year, reaching a record $37 million in the first quarter. Over 82,000 all-to-all trades were completed during the quarter compared to 35,000 in Q1 2015. Open Trading average saving volume was up 36% sequentially versus the fourth quarter. We were especially encouraged by the increasing number of unique liquidity providers or price markers on the platform, which grew to 527 firms, up from 346 in Q1 a year ago. This expanding pool of participants helped drive a 259% year-over-year increase in Open Trading price responses. In the first quarter of 2016, transaction cost savings for U.S. high-grade open trades averaged 5 basis points in yield and high-yield trades at average savings of 0.5 or $5,000 per million traded. We continue to invest in new and innovative trading protocols to expand the set of open trading solutions for our clients. Our most recent technology release includes private trade, order blotter matching to limit information leakage for larger trades as well as open trading functionality for the municipal bond market. We are encouraged by the growing success of open trading as an alternative pool of liquidity for large and growing global credit markets. Slide 7 provides an update on Europe. Our European business continues to grow with 46% year-over-year increase in trading volumes from European client during Q1. European client volume growth was driven by Eurobond, emerging markets and U.S. credit products trading. Data revenue was up 17% year-over-year. We are also encouraged by the rapid adoption of Open Trading in Europe with 65% of Eurobond inquiry now being submitted to Market List. The ECB has recently announced plans to have investment-grade corporate bonds denominated in euros to the asset-purchase program beginning in June. The current expectation is that most of these bonds will be purchased in a primary or new issue market. Depending on the size of the corporate bond purchases, this could crowd out private sector purchases of corporate bonds and as the margin reduced overall secondary turnover with some bonds. MiFID II is expected to be implemented in 2018, expanding opportunities in electronic trading, data and regulatory reporting. The regulations will require increased regulatory transaction reporting for both investor and dealer firms and will bring greater transparency to European markets. We are enthused about our growing involvement in European markets. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony, for more detail on our financial results.
Antonio DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue reached a record $89 million, up 15% from a year-ago. The record trading volumes led to an 18% year-over-year improvement in quarterly commission revenue. As to the impact of the strength in dollar, information and post-trade revenue was up 6%, mainly driven by 12% increase in data revenue. Total expenses were $44 million, up 15% year-over-year and reflects our continuing investment in people and systems to support our growth initiatives. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our headcount increased by 54 with the vast majority related to newly created positions sitting in technology and customer facing positions. The effective tax rate was 34.7% for the first quarter. The year-over-year reduction in the effective tax rate reflects a higher percentage of income attributable to lower tax rate jurisdictions. Our diluted EPS was $0.77 on a stable diluted share-count of 37.7 million shares. On Slide 9 we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Variable transaction fees were up 23% year over year, as the increase in trading volume was offset by a slight decline in overall transaction fees per million. Our U.S. high-grade fee capture is influenced by a number of factors including the duration of bonds traded on the platform, trade size and dealer fee plan mix. The $6 per million sequential increase in high-grade fee capture was due primarily to slightly higher years to maturity and a small shift in trade size. In line with the comments made on the year-end earnings call, distribution fees were sequentially lower, reflecting the movement of several dealers to the all variable fee plans during the fourth quarter. Now, other credit category fee capture is influenced by the product mix between Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yields, and mix with enterprise. The $21 per million sequential decline of fee capture was due to several factors. We experienced higher growth in trading volumes from Eurobonds, a greater percentage of high-yield bonds traded on our spreads protocol and emerging market trading volume skewed towards sovereign bonds versus corporate bonds. Each of the mix changes result in the heavier weighting to lower fee capture products. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. The majority of the $4.5 million sequential increase in expenses was due to higher compensation and benefits cost. The variable bonus accrual which is tied directly to operating performance was $1.7 million higher. Employment taxes and benefits were $1.1 million higher and reflect the typical first-quarter seasonality where items like employer taxes are front-end loaded. Salaries were also $700,000 higher and reflect the headcount increase and wage adjustments effective the first of the year. An increase in third party clearing cost associated with the growth in Open Trading and larger reference data spend to support new product launches accounted for the remainder of the variance. We continue to target a roughly 10% increase in employee headcounts over the course of this year when compared to the year-end 2015 balance. The timing of the expected headcount increase, level of performance-based variable incentive compensation and foreign currency movements between the dollar and pound sterling among other items could cause variations in the expense outcome. On Slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of March 31 were $285 million and consistent with the year-end 2015 level. During the first quarter, we paid out our year-end employee cash bonuses and related taxes of roughly $27 million, the quarterly tax dividend of $10 million and capital expenditures of $6 million. We have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. We initiated repurchases under our new share buyback program on March 1 to offset dilution from equity grants. During the first quarter we repurchased 10,000 shares at a cost of $1.2 million. As of March 31 approximately $24 million was available for future repurchases under the program. Based on the first quarter results our board has approved a $0.26 regular quarterly dividend. Now let’s turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Richard McVey: Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results reflect a broad-base increase in demand for electronic trading solutions in global credit markets. We are encouraged by the breadth of volume and market share gains across products, regions and client segments. The market need for open trading solutions to more easily connect buyers and sellers of bonds is becoming more apparent each quarter. Our launch of municipal bond trading is another step toward expanding our footprint to provide our clients with best-in-class technology solutions in new areas of the credit markets. Now, I will be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Adams with Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Michael Adams: Good morning, gentlemen. Congrats, you did it again, another record quarter here.
Richard McVey: Hey, Mike.
Michael Adams: So, first question, on Europe, a big uptick in the Eurobond volume in the first quarter. I think it was up like 70% sequentially, give or take. So could you dissect this growth a bit, between seasonal factors, new customer adds, share gains, anything else worth mentioning? And then, what do you attribute these gains to, because you’ve been investing in Europe for a while, so what was the tipping point for customers?
Richard McVey: Mike, it’s really a continuation of what was started last year. You’ll recall, we did make some protocol changes, the first of last year, the first of 2015, where we opened up the trading protocols to give clients the choice of the dealers they go out to on inquiries. We launched Open Trading a year ago. That had made the difference. And us - see, we have more clients engaged in Eurobonds today than we ever had in the past. We had an increase. This is just year-over-year. We had an increase of about 30% in number of clients that are actively trading Eurobonds. So we’re delivering more value that’s more content on the platform. It’s driving more order-flow to the platform. Some of that is driven around protocols, around data that’s exposed in the platform. But it’s a combination of all that.
Michael Adams: Got it. And then, somewhat similar question on some of the statistics you’re providing on Open Trading. But the big spike in the response count this quarter, what are you going to attribute that to and what percentage of your customers at this point are actually price makers?
Richard McVey: So the 525-or-so that we’re responding on the system during the first quarter would represent approximately 50% of the active clients of the system, which we think is a very encouraging sign. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, as the participation grows in the price responders, the transaction cost savings are also growing. So this is a virtuous cycle, where the more people that are in the pool the better transaction cost savings that we can deliver. So I think what I reflect, Mike, is that the behavioral change taking place is a combination of traditional market participants that now have a new way to provide enforced [ph] liquidity in the credit markets as well as our platform enabling new participants to be more involved in credit market making than they have in the past. So I think it was a very encouraging quarter for us in Open Trading and we’re seeing positive results across most of our product areas.
Michael Adams: Got it. And last one for me, but muni bond trading, it’s been up for - I think up in right now for all of two weeks, so it’s a bit premature to go here. But I’d like to anyway. What’s been the initial response from customers, the good and the bad? And what kind of volume has been executed on the platform today?
Richard McVey: Yes, it’s very early. In fact, it’s not even two weeks, Mike. It’s about six days of trading, so very difficult to draw any immediate conclusions from the activity level. The client and dealer response has been very positive. We think the first release of the municipal bond technology has been very well received. Like with all products we have plenty of ideas on an n-spin [ph] to the upcoming releases and the technology will continue to get better. But there are a lot of things that I like. It’s very simple, when we look at past successes that you really need three key components. You need a comprehensive technology solution that suits the practices in that market. We are highly confident that we have that, with single security solutions, fin-offer [ph] solutions and open trading all live for municipal bond trading. You need broad-based dealer pricing and liquidity. We already have about 65 dealers onboarded for municipal bond trading. We expect that number to grow to something like 90 to 100 over the coming months. So we have broad based dealer interest in the product. Within that, I am very encouraged, because the other thing we are getting with muni, for new clients to the platform, in nearly half of the muni dealers that come on MarketAxess are brand new broker dealers for the company. And then third, you need broad-based investor demand, and that is showing up as well with the 200 clients that have onboarded for munis with more coming again in the coming months, and early experience with them has been positive. So we don’t have a specific volume information report, but we’re trading munis every day and more clients are in testing the software and having good results. We expect that the balance of this quarter will be about laying the foundations in terms of blocking and tackling of dealer approvals to trade with clients. And the training that’s going on for all the municipal despos [ph] the by-side and sell-side. But we think we are in really good shape in the third quarter. It will probably be a better reflection of adoption rates.
Michael Adams: Got it. Great color, Rick. I’ll get back in the queue. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.
Richard McVey: Hello, Kyle.
Antonio DeLise: Good morning, Kyle.
Kyle Voigt: Good morning. So just first question would be on Open Trading, just a follow-up, so the market with trade-count by client segment, looks like the percentage of long-only investor managers winning these trades is growing pretty substantially, so I think it was at 48% in the first quarter, up from 33% in the fourth quarter. So can you just kind of elaborate on what’s driving that as growing proportionate of long-onlys wining the trades? Is it just more long-onlys getting comfortable with putting that prices, or is there any color that you can provide there? Thanks.
Richard McVey: I think it’s something - it’s 48% of the volume and Open Trading is being completed with price responders from the long-only community. Their average ticket sizes are higher than some participants on the platform, but it also reflects as you suggested a behavioral change for many of them. And the number of opportunities that we are providing each day, are creating more and more focus for traditional investment managers that see new ways to buy and sell bonds in the secondary market. And we also see a trend where more and more traditional investment managers are hiring trading skills from the street, where there are people very comfortable being opportunistic price makers and that is starting to come true on the platform as well. There is still a lot of work to do. This is a big change for investment managers that have typically had a fairly rigid trading process in structure and historically have gone to dealers for pricing. So I would not underestimate the amount of change that’s still in front of us. But sequentially, we are very encouraged by the results that we see and the investment management community continuing to move in that direction.
Antonio DeLise: Hey, Kyle, hi, just one clarifying point, just to be clear on that slide, that slide is showing the volume distribution by segment, by client segment. If you look back in prior quarters with the trade count distribution…
Kyle Voigt: Okay.
Antonio DeLise: …everything Rick provided in terms of color and more engagement from the buy-side is absolutely spot-on. It’s just the - the view was a little bit different quarter-to-quarter.
Kyle Voigt: So this is notional versus natural count last quarter?
Antonio DeLise: Exactly, right, yes.
Kyle Voigt: All right. So just another question I guess on expenses. So if you analyze the first quarter expenses you get to above the high-end of your guided range. So am I right to think about this was a step function in the first quarter and there might be some tapering off of expenses throughout the year or should we expect the expense base continue to do? Thanks.
Richard McVey: Kyle, on the expenses, in the earnings press release, we did we reconfirm our expense guidance. And that would - the expense guidance was $168 million to $176 million. You can’t simply take the first quarter really and use that as a jumping off point. This is a - it’s a bit of an anomaly, every first quarter where you have employer taxes and 401 K matching and other items which hit really in the first quarter. So it’s not one where you’re going to take that number in and jump off. It’s a little early to say where we’re going to fall within that range - within the guidance range. I mentioned in the prepared marks some swing factors with employee headcount and variable incentive pay and foreign exchange. Those are all items that could swing the outcome. But I leave you with one message and that is we’re continuing to invest, we think the time is right with all the market structure changes going on. We’re expanding the addressable market and increasing geographic reach and launching new products and we’re going to continue on that path.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, understood. And then just one last follow up. Sorry, Rick, I missed this. Can you repeat when you said in terms of high-grade market share for April so far? I think you said roughly the same as 1Q, but I just want to confirm that. Thanks.
Richard McVey: We actually said that the April month today high-grade shares running above the first quarter level and total average daily volume on the system is consistent with first quarter level.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hugh Miller with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Hugh Miller: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Good morning.
Richard McVey: Good morning. Hugh, how are you?
Hugh Miller: Great. So definitely appreciate some of the color you guys provided with the granularity on the municipal bond trading, pricing, fee capture, that type. I was wondering, can you just remind us again as you think about the longer term addressable market for that product for electronic trading, where do you kind of see that? And as we think about trading maybe a year from now, is there a particular market share goal that you guys has set?
Richard McVey: Yes, we think the significant portion of the municipal bond market is addressable for electronic trading. I got some similar characteristics to corporate bond market in terms of very high percentages of small tickets. And as you know we continue to add trading enhancements that are designed to help with the concern about information leakage for larger trades. So we think a significant portion of market will be addressable by electronic trading venues. We haven’t set a specific market share target. We have internal estimates. It’s really difficult to predict. And these markets historically always take time to get the clients to change their trade behavior and move forward their business electronic. I would repeat though anecdotally as we launched this product, the feedback we’re getting from both investors and dealers in my opinion the most positive we’ve ever seen. So we’re cautiously optimistic that the adoption reach for this product here it could be faster than we’ve seen in the past, but we don’t have any specific market share targets to share with your today.
Hugh Miller: Sure, sure. That’s definitely helpful. And I understand it’s completely early days. But given that roughly half of the dealers that you are bringing on to the platform for munis are newer to MarketAxess. What are some of the anticipated challenges from getting people comfortable with the system in responding in those types of things? I mean, are there lessons that you’ve learned from other rollout that you guys expect to kind of aid that? And what are the challenges you anticipate just from kind of getting used to and leveraging the platform for these dealers?
Richard McVey: I think two things. One, part of the headcount increase that Tony talked about earlier was specific to the muni product. So we’ve been bringing in experienced muni bond professionals that are working with dealers as well as dedicated investor debts and also owning our own sales-force that covers investors more broadly to understand the nuances and specifics of the muni bond market. But the other point is I would say two things. We get very high marks for the ease of use of our technology platform. All accounts, it’s very intuitive. The logic is comfortable for dealers and investors, because we do try replicate the practices in each individual market. So we are confident that we will have a successful launch in terms of client dealer usage and ease on the platform. And then, finally, I think what ultimately drives the pace of all this is investor order-flow. So the key is generating the investor demand, and the order flow that makes it more interesting for dealers. They’re providing a market-making role, and so we are working very hard in the investor-side too to get them to understand the benefits of the platform and build usage just as soon as we can.
Hugh Miller: Great, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then, just shifting a little bit towards the other category, fee capture in the quarter, you mentioned kind of within the high-yield product for shift towards the high-yields spread protocol, can you just remind us what the differential is in fee capture within high-yield amongst those categories?
Richard McVey: Sure, Hugh. There were several factors during the quarter driving the other credit fee capture down.
Hugh Miller: Yes, yes, we...
Richard McVey: I’ll tell you - I’ll tell you first, first off, it was - listen, it was a great quarter. And all the products in that group grew. So it wasn’t that we change pricing. So it was a pretty spectacular outcome. On your very specific question, so we have some high-yield bonds that trade on price and some high-yield bonds mainly cross-overs that trade on our spread protocol. And just to put it in context, spread protocol means that the fee capture would look like the high-grade fee capture. And then, you have high-yield that trades on price, which maybe 3X the high-grade fee capture. So when we do have a shift, which does happen on a case, you will see more or less coming from price based or spread based, when you have that sort of shift it does influence fee capture a little bit. The bigger change during the quarter was Eurobond, if you were looking at the fourth quarter fee capture, and you are jumping off a point for estimating other credit fee capture was the fourth quarter level, when EM and high-yield only grew 20% and Eurobond grew 70%, we have a mix shift, so that was the bigger influence sequentially.
Hugh Miller: Yes. I definitely appreciate the color. We - in kind of backing into the numbers, the others were kind of self-evident. We’ve talked about in the past the mix shift with the Eurobond growing and then also the EM sovereign, the corporate. I was just asking specifically on the high-yield category, because those trying to back into the numbers. I was just noticing that that you likely saw a little bit of down-tick in the high-yield bucket, and just wanted to get some color around kind of the dynamics for that particular product category. So it’s definitely helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning, guys.
Richard McVey: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: I was hoping you can give an update on your leverage loan initiative in terms of expected rollout or trading there. And I guess your expectations in terms of customer adoption of leverage loan trading kind of relative to customer adoption of muni trading?
Richard McVey: Yes, the leverage loan product area we said in the past, the average daily volume estimates that we have, we do just somewhere around $2 billion or $2.5 billion a day. So it’s roughly a third of the size of the muni market in terms of average daily volume. The release date has moved toward the end of this quarter or early Q3. It will have the normal onboarding issues the tackle upfront. So I would guess that we are looking at quarter three for the leverage loan product in terms of getting the foundation in place. Focus in the second quarter is going to be mostly on the municipal bond launch.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it. Thank you. Quick question on your distribution fees, Tony, I apologize if I missed it. But I don’t think you gave any guidance for second quarter distribution fees. So should we probably expect those to be roughly flat quarter over quarter?
Antonio DeLise: I think that’s a pretty good assumption. Right, I’ll say, right now, we are tracking anything of substance. But, again, I’ll also remind you that we do provide choices to the dealers in fee plans. And they’re responding to the economics of the plan and changes in what they’re committing to the capital and changes in the size of their debt. So there is always a possibility as to fluctuations. But right now we aren’t tracking anything that does.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: All right. Great. That’s all I got for you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Marcus Carney: Good morning, gentlemen. This is Marcus Carney in for Ashley Serrao.
Richard McVey: Good morning.
Marcus Carney: I just had a question. Competitor recent - a startup competitor, recently announced plans to offer like maker-taker rebates on their electronic bond trading platform. I was wondering if you could just give us thoughts on kind of the competitive landscape in general and whether or not something like that would work well for electronic corporate bonds.
Richard McVey: Well, I’ll be happy to start with the competitive landscape in general and then your specific question on maker-taker. But when you look at our sequential growth, Q4 to Q1, we added roughly $60 billion in trading volume sequentially. So we feel really good about the acceleration of share gains on the MarketAxess platform. We have seen a few volume reports in the media from some of the startups in the credit space. And anecdotally we pick up information most weeks as well. And we’re highly confident that that volume and market share growth for MarketAxess in Q1 represents a strengthening of our competitive position relative to the others in the space. So we feel very good about that. The new platform we have, quite honestly, we haven’t heard a whole lot about it. But as I said in the past, the critical fees of reducing transaction cost for credit market participants is in the size of the network and the technology to identify matches. And those cost savings opportunities are so meaningful as we discussed in prepared comments that credit unlike commoditized product areas is not really all about just the transaction fees. It’s really about the technology and the breadth of the network and the ability to identify matches that can then deliver very significant transaction cost savings for overall the clients. So I think what you are seeing is that the benefit that we have is the enormous investment in trading protocols that suit the credit markets that we have made over the last 16 years and continue to make it a larger level that anybody in the space combined with over a 1,000 institutional firms that are actively trading on the platform. And that’s what ultimately delivers value to our clients.
Marcus Carney: Excellent. Thank you. And then, just a follow up on the new initiatives, I believe last quarter you said that you expected business promotion expenses to be about $2 million to $3 million. With the successful launch of munis and slight pushback in the loans, is that kind of still the range you expect?
Antonio DeLise: Yes, Marc, I think it is. We did sort of run in low some of the muni expenses. So we’re sitting here now with about 10 dedicated personnel, most of those in sales and technology and even the support area. And then there is reference data and some other cost associated with that, but fully loaded, it’s probably $3-million-plus. But over the course of this year because another will be staged, then it’s still that $2 million to $3 million number.
Marcus Carney: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Now, we have a follow up from Mike Adams with Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Michael Adams: Hey, guys. A question on pricing, I know one area where you have utilized some pricing incentives is with open trading. So I’m curious if the success that you’ve been seeing has had any impact overall in pricing and if you could try to quantify that for us? Just trying to understand what the continued growth could mean to pricing a couple years from now.
Antonio DeLise: Mike, this is Tony. We have set some bagging [ph] out just now. On the pricing side, we do provide some incentives in open trade. It’s one of those things that we’re continuing to look at the pricing models and different ways of incenting behavior. I can’t say there is anything - if anything is imminent right now. We’ll continue to look at it. We’ll evaluate the fee plans. But nothing imminent at this stage right now.
Michael Adams: Okay. But Open Trading to-date hasn’t really moved your revenue per million in any of the various buckets yet?
Antonio DeLise: Mike, on an overall basis, it really - it does not influence the U.S. high-grade’s fees per million, nor does it influence the overall fees per million. And if I can, I’ll tell you that on the overall fees per million, Open Trading influence may be $1 or $2 per million impact in the overall fees per million, but really it’s not influencing it right now.
Michael Adams: Got it, great, and, Tony, I’ll squeeze one last one here. I know you guys have provided some color on April. But just given some of the underlying mix-shifts in the other credit bucket, could you comment on the mix of other credit in April, have you seen any changes or should we expect that to be relatively stable?
Antonio DeLise: Mike, getting that granular right now will be - it will be little too granular. And it’s also - I mean, if what you’re trying to get at is, where do you think fee capture is going, is it a little early to start talking about that. I’ll tell you that from a fee capture standpoint what we’re seeing in April is no significant difference than what we saw in the first quarter. I’m talking about total fees per million, variable transaction fees per million, not completely [ph] different. Some of that - you have market volumes in these products growing at different rates right now and that’s why this - to talk about it right now would just be a little bit premature.
Michael Adams: Got it, now, that’s good color. Thanks, Tony.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn it back to Mr. Rick McVey for any closing remarks.
Richard McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. And we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-01-27 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - Investor Relations Manager Rick McVey - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tony DeLise - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill Kyle Voigt - KBW Hugh Miller - Macquarie Michael Wong - Morningstar
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 27, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess fourth quarter 2015 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses and then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. This morning, we are pleased to report a strong fourth quarter and full year results driven by record overall trading volumes for both periods with an acceleration in market share gains across our core products. Fourth quarter revenues were $77 million, up 9% compared to Q4 2014. Pre-tax income for the quarter was up 10% to $37 million and diluted EPS was up 14% to $0.65. Our estimated adjusted U.S. high-grade market share was 17.6% in Q4, up from 16.1% a year ago. We had a record quarter for U.S. high-yield and emerging market trading volumes and volume from European clients was up 52% year-over-year. Momentum continues in open trading, with record volumes and participation in the fourth quarter. Slide 4 highlights our full year results. Revenue and earnings growth for the full year in 2015 was consistent with our strong long-term growth rates. Full year 2015 revenues were a record $303 million, up 15% from 2014 and diluted EPS was up 29% to a record $2.55. Commission revenues for 2015 were up 20% year-over-year to a record $266 million and its overall trading volumes reached a record $979 billion, up 28%. Our strong results for the year were due to an acceleration in market share gains across U.S. high-grade, high-yield emerging markets and Eurobonds. Based on available market data, we believe share gains across these core products were significantly higher in 2015 than in prior years. Estimated adjusted U.S. high-grade market share for the year was a record 16.8%, up from 14.5% in 2014 and estimated high-yield share was 9.3%, up from 6.2%. Eurobond volume was up 78% from 2014 and active Eurobond client firms increased to 344 from 271 year-over-year. Our free cash flow for the year was $105 million. And in light of our results and our outlook, the Board of Directors approved a 30% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. Overall, market volumes were slightly higher in 2015 with high-grade trades volumes up 5% and high-yield volumes up 8% for the full year. Fourth quarter trades volumes were consistent with Q3 and with the prior year. Benchmark high-grade credit spreads remained study in Q4 while in high-yield we saw an increase in spreads and an uptick in volatility driven primarily by increased distress in the energy sector. U.S. high-grade new issuance was flat in Q4 both compared to Q3 and to the fourth quarter of 2014 though U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate debt outstanding continues to rise and was up about 10% year-over-year. For the second consecutive quarter, fixed income mutual funds saw significant outflows while dealers further reduced their balance sheets for market making. With dealer balance sheet capacity scarce, more dealers are operating on an agency basis and demand for all-to-all open trading continues to grow. Slide 6 highlights our expanding market opportunity. We are actively investing to expand the range of global credit products available for trading on our platform. Our local currency emerging market volumes were up 238% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and local market trading now represents 20% of our overall EM volumes. According to EMTA, local currency trading makes up about 58% of global EM secondary trading volumes and we view this as a significant opportunity to further expand our EM offering. We expect to add municipal bonds to the platform in the second quarter of this year based on broad demand from both dealer and investor clients. We believe that we can improve efficiency and lower transaction costs in the muni market by deploying our trading, data and post-trade technology solutions. We expect to have approximately 250 institutional clients and 60 dealers live for muni trading at the time of launch. We also plan to add leveraged loans in Q2 to complement our existing high-yield business. In aggregate, this expanded product set represents an additional $20 billion in average daily trading volume. A 1% increase in trading volumes across our core and expanded markets, we now deliver approximately $35 million to $39 million in additional annual revenues. Our launch into new products leverages our growing client network and our technology investment. For the full year in 2015, over 1,000 client firms were active on MarketAxess and the number of clients trading three or more products has grown from 329 in 2010 to 616 in 2015. Our growth strategy is to increase market share in core products, add new products and services to our trading system and continue to expand our global client footprint. Slide 7 provides an update on open trading. Open trading volumes doubled year-over-year, reaching a record $27.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Over 57,000 all-to-all trades were completed during the quarter compared to 28,000 in Q4 2014. Open trading trade volume was up about 25% in Q4 versus Q3. We were especially encouraged by the increasing number of unique liquidity providers or price makers on the platform, which grew to 469 firms, up from 307 in Q4 of last year. This expanding pool of participants helped drive a 165% year-over-year increase in open trading price responses. Price providers to open trading are enjoying some of the biggest transaction cost savings on the system as bid out spreads begin to widen. The profile of open trading liquidity providers continues to be fairly evenly split between long holding investment managers, dealers and other participants, such as ETF market makers and hedge funds. We are creating unique and valuable trading connections that allow market participants to expand their sources of liquidity. Over 13% combined U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield volume on MarketAxess now takes place through open trading protocols, up from approximately 7% a year ago and participants benefit from average cost savings of more than 4 basis points in yield when they complete a U.S. high grade transaction using Open Trading. Open Trading technology enhancements will remain a key focus area for investment in 2016. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for more details on our volumes and financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were $250 billion, up from $211 billion 1 year ago. U.S. high grade volumes were $143 billion for the quarter, up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2014. The improvement in high grade volume was primarily attributable to more than 25% increase in inquiry volume. Volumes in the other credit category were up 42% year-over-year, driven by substantial order flow increases across all products. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we reported record trading volumes for high yield and emerging market bonds. Based on Trax and TRACE data, emerging markets and Eurobond market volumes continued their recent downward trend and declined more than 10% year-over-year, while high yield market volume was up modestly. This means that the vast majority of the volume growth in our other credit categories resulted from market share gains. With three trading days remaining in January, estimated high grade market share is running consistent with the fourth quarter level and around 200 basis points higher than January 2015. Net growth in the other credit category remained strong. Slide 9 displays our quarterly earnings reports. Revenues of $76.6 million were up 9% from the year ago, driven by record quarterly commission revenue. Total expenses were $39.7 million, up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014 and in line with the full year 2015 growth. As to the impact of the stronger dollar, the expense increase was approximately 10% year-over-year. Both operating income and EBITDA were up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The effective tax rate was 33.8% for the fourth quarter and reflects the recognition of certain tax credits amounting to approximately $400,000, which were permanently signed into law in December 2015. The 180 basis point reduction in the full year effective tax rate from 36.9% in 2014 to 35.1% in 2015 reflects the higher percentage of income attributable to lower tax rate jurisdiction and a reduction in service statutory flooring and state tax rates. Our diluted share count of EPS was $0.65 on a stable diluted share count of 37.6 million shares. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 16% year-over-year due to the 18% increase in trading volume, offset by a slight decline in overall transaction fees per million. Our U.S. high grade fee capture is influenced by a number of factors, including the duration of bonds traded on the platform, trade size and dealer fee plan mix. The $5 per million sequential increase in high grade fee capture was due primarily to higher execution fees resulting from the migration of three dealers during the fourth quarter from the major dealer fee plan to the all variable fee plan. The dealer migrations were the main contributors to the $700,000 sequential decline in U.S. high grade distribution fees. First quarter of 2016 distribution fees are expected to be approximately $800,000 lower than the fourth quarter level, reflecting a full quarter impact of the Q4 dealer movement. In the other credit category, the fourth quarter mix of product volume and fee capture were consistent with the third quarter levels. The approximate 10% year-over-year decline in the other credit category fees per million were principally due to a mix shift within this category, including a heavier weighting toward emerging market sovereign bonds. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Total fourth quarter expenses were up $800,000 from the third quarter level. Employee headcount was up slightly during the quarter and reached 342 at December year end. On a year-over-year basis, the 9% growth in compensation and benefits was due to a combination of higher salary expense on an increase in headcount and higher equity based compensation costs. In the aggregate, non-compensation costs were up 7% year-over-year. Higher clearing costs reflected in the G&A line and marketing expenses were partially offset by lower technology related costs. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available for sale as of December 31 were $284 million compared to $234 million at year end 2014. Free cash flow reached a record $105 million in 2015 and was more than sufficient to cover the $53 million in dividends and share repurchases and the $15 million in capital expenditures. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 33,000 shares under our existing share repurchase program. There was no change in our capital structure during the fourth quarter. We have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. On Slide 13, we summarize our capital management activities. We continue to invest in organic initiatives to expand the addressable market, product offering and geographic reach which remain our primary capital deployment focus. The annual expense surrounding software enhancements to our trading platform of protocols and other organic initiatives have increased five-fold since 2010 and we expect a further ramp up in such investments in 2016. Our recurring quarterly dividend is an important element of our capital management strategy. The 30% increase in the quarterly dividend follows the 25% increase in 2015. We have now increased the dividend in six consecutive years. Today, we also announced the authorization of the $25 million share repurchase program which will replace our existing plan that is scheduled to expire at the end of February. Repurchases under this program will be designed to offset the increase in our diluted share count principally resulting from employee equity grants. Through our existing cash position and strong cash flow generation, we have the flexibility to fund our investment priorities and return capital to shareholders. On Slide 14, we have our 2016 expense, capital expenditure and income tax rate guidance. We expect the total 2016 expenses will be in the range of $168 million to $176 million. The midpoint in that range suggests an approximate 11% increase in year-over-year expenses, which will be a little above our 5-year compound annual growth rate adjusted for the Trax acquisition in 2013. The up tick and expected expense growth results from continued investment in Open Trading and other product expansion initiatives. Consistent with 2015, employee compensation and benefit costs are expected to represent a little over 50% of total expenses in 2016. Over the course of the year, we are targeting headcount to increase around 10%. The timing of the expected headcount increase, variable incentive compensation and foreign currency movements between the dollar and pound sterling could cause variations in the expense outcome. We expect that 2016 capital expenditures will be several million dollars above the 2015 level and will range from $18 million to $22 million. The majority of the increase will be trading platform enhancements and new product features in the form of software development costs. We expect to see effective tax rate for full year 2016 will be similar to 2015 and will range from 34% to 36%. The mix of U.S. and foreign source income could cause variations in the effective tax rate. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Tony. 2015 was a strong year of revenue and earnings growth for MarketAxess, consistent with long-term averages. Our competitive position continues to get stronger as evidenced by our accelerating market share gains in core products. Open trading is leading the way with innovative solutions to enhance credit market liquidity. In Europe, growth in trading volumes and the integration of Trax provides the foundation for improved earnings from the region. Now, I will be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. You may begin.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning guys.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: So, as you think about the new product launches that you are going to be having in the second quarter, what are you most excited about near-term and what are you most excited about long-term?
Rick McVey: I think in the near term we are already seeing some results from the EM local market expansion and we think that will continue throughout 2016 and beyond and represents a significant opportunity. Based on the client feedback we are getting, we are also enthusiastic about the launch of municipal bond trading. It’s a large market, highly fragmented indeed in electronic trading solutions and we do believe that the capabilities that we have will add a lot of value to our clients in that product area. So, we are looking forward to that launch which we have planned for the second quarter of this year.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it. And Tony, once you do begin to see volumes and revenues in leveraged loans and munis, do you anticipate including those within the other credit bucket?
Tony DeLise: Patrick, that’s what we would put them in there, yes, in the other credit bucket. And we will continue to break out the volumes and provide as much granularity as necessary to understand the swings in that category. And just remember, with the planned Q2 launches, it’s more of a second half of the year exercise, but we will provide at least enough granularity to understand what’s happening in that bucket.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it. I appreciate that. Moving to open trading, I think with some of the functionality that you have built into that in terms of kind of being able to do trade workups and still trading larger block trades, I guess I am a little bit surprised that the average trade size doesn’t appear to have really moved up over the last few quarters. Does that surprise you at all? And would you anticipate that average trade size starting to ramp over the next few quarters and years?
Rick McVey: I think the evolution is pretty close to what we would have expected in open trading. I think it’s an additional liquidity pool available to clients on the platform and the results so far have been that clients are using open trading for similar trade sizes as they always have in the client to dealer module. But we did have a good year overall in block trading. Our block trading volume was up about 25% in 2015. So, we are encouraged by what we see there, but we obviously continue to gain share in smaller trade sizes as well, which is why the average trade size hasn’t budged that much. We have, Patrick, some important enhancements rolling out in the second quarter for open trading, which we think will continue to address the client concern about information leakage by allowing for private negotiations once we have identified a match on the trading platform. And I think as we continue to enhance the capabilities around large trade sizes, we will see better progress in the quarters and years to come, but block trading does continue to be an important part of what we are doing and it was about 20% of our volume during the fourth quarter and over 90% of the trades reported to TRACE. And we think we are doing the right things on the technology enhancements to make it easier for clients and dealers to trade more blocks on the system.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it. And then one last one for Tony on a related note, as we think about your clearing costs that I think are an increasingly large component of your G&A expenses, should we think about those scaling up kind of one-for-one with your open trading volumes?
Tony DeLise: Patrick, it is a growing piece of the expense right now, but I don’t think it’s going to scale on a one-for-one basis. Right now, the model is to use a third-party clearing agent. It is not scaled exactly one-for-one right now. It’s not what we had forecasted for next year either. And we will continue to look at how we are clearing right now. We are looking at alternatives and really reacting to the way clients want to clear and represent prices and we will not scale one-for-one, no.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Adams with Sandler O’Neill. You may begin.
Mike Adams: Good morning, Rick and Tony. Congrats on another very strong year here.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Mike.
Tony DeLise: Thanks Mike.
Mike Adams: So, I want to touch on the product expansion as well and appreciate some of the detail you gave us on Slide 6, but when you look at muni bonds and leveraged loans like some of these less liquid markets, how should we think about maybe the electronic penetration you think you can achieve? Could you frame that for us?
Rick McVey: We are bullish longer term and I think somewhat cautious on short-term, because any time we launched a new product getting both clients and dealers engaged in electronic trading and responding the way they can and fully integrated does take a little bit of time. But when we look at the municipal market, it has some similar characteristics to the corporate bond market in that it’s inundated with small trades that are not being conducted all that efficiently today. So, we believe we can have a significant impact in that market. And I think when you look at the potential for market share longer term, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see the institutional muni business moving to 35%, 40% electronic. So, it’s early days for us. We think we have all the right client feedback and the network and the technology to really make a difference for our clients. We are excited about the launch, but history would show that it does take a number of quarters to get people fully engaged.
Mike Adams: Great. Thank you for that color. And then on a related note, just looking at the expense guidance, Tony, you mentioned the 11% growth pretty healthy relative to history. So, could you provide a little bit of insight on the revenue side? I mean, it sounds like we shouldn’t expect too much contribution from the product expansion this year, but like maybe what about the outlook for some of the non-transaction businesses you have been investing pretty heavily over in Europe? How should we think about that this year?
Tony DeLise: Mike, you know the guidance we provided right now is limited to the expense side and tax rate and capital spend. And on the non-transaction side and you saw what we delivered in 2015 which was relatively flat on the information and post-trade side. We are expecting some growth there. Again, without being specific, we are expecting some growth there. And in that area, it’s a little hidden, but our data revenue was up 12% year-over-year. It’s matched a little bit by the foreign currency impact. So, we did face some headwinds with the stronger dollar there. We have new data products and liquidity products coming online. There is client demand and uptick and interest in those products. The sales cycle is a little bit longer, but we do expect some revenue growth. So without being specific, we do expect some growth in that information in post-trade line.
Rick McVey: I would just add to that, Mike, on the European side. We are pretty excited about a couple of things that clients are responding very well to. One, we have taken another step of integration of the Trax data into the trading platform. So, it’s increasing the visibility of that data and the usefulness to our clients for price discovery. And secondly, we are following a similar path in open trading in Europe to the one that we have accomplished in the U.S. So each quarter, we are seeing more take up around the open trading and the promise of a new and valuable liquidity source for our clients in Eurobonds. So, we are very focused on the region. We are happy with what we accomplished during the year in 2015, but we think there is much more ahead if we can continue to execute and deliver unique value to our clients.
Mike Adams: Okay. And one last one for me, just on the subject of pricing, could you update us on your thoughts around pricing for the other credit bucket, you mentioned I think on the last call you were considering some tweaks to accelerate share gains, so have you discussed this with customers and is this something we could see this year?
Tony DeLise: Mike on the pricing side, there is some pricing in the revenue model, it’s critical to our success. It is critical to long-term success, getting that right. We believe that the liquidity take or pays model or the market model if that’s – that is the right model. And we have that model in place for high grade. We have that model in place for Open Trading. And we do think it scales better for dealers, it scales better for liquidity providers, it promotes price responding. And when you think about our success, our success is really in the depth of our liquidity pool. The deeper the pool, the more prices bounces back, the more trades are executed, the more inquiry flow in the platform. We have got this virtual circle running. We have got a couple of products today that don’t run on that market model and that’s high yield and emerging markets and Eurobonds. We are continuing to evaluate when and if the time is right to adjust those fee plans. But nothing right now in the near-term that we intend to unchain, that would impact the revenue outcome for 2016.
Mike Adams: Okay. Thanks Tony and congrats gentlemen.
Rick McVey: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may begin.
Kyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question.
Rick McVey: Hi Kyle.
Tony DeLise: Good morning Kyle.
Kyle Voigt: Good morning. So I guess, I will ask another couple of questions on the planned expansion to munis and leveraged loans, I guess can you just give us more – some more color regarding effort that’s already gone into getting ready for the launches in the second quarter. How long have you been preparing for this and how long have your clients has been asking for and is there any sense that you can give us whether client demand has been growing more recently. And then just secondly, could you expand on some of the challenges of getting these muni traders to begin using the platform and then how you expect to kind of overcome this?
Rick McVey: Sure. A couple of things on that, Kyle, the client demand has been building really over the last year. And we have many large asset management clients that have their municipal bond traders sitting alongside their high grade and high yield traders, watching their colleagues enjoy the efficiency and the cost savings of the MarketAxess system throughout the trading day and that has led to quite a bit of demand to add the municipal bond products to this system. So that’s been growing over the last year, which is why beginning in the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, we started to prioritize the technology enhancements to launch the municipal bond product. The work has been going on for about six months. As I mentioned earlier, the benefit that we have is we are leveraging a lot of the technology investments that we have made over the last 15 years or 16 years because the bid and offer list capabilities combined with Open Trading are exactly what the municipal bond clients are looking for, so that work has been going on. We are on track for completion in the second quarter and we would expect to launch trading during the first half of that quarter. The challenges are the ones that we have observed before. It’s a change in trading behavior. So it’s the blocking and tackling of getting clients to input more of their bid and offer lists and their order flow into the system, getting used to using the technology and it’s getting the price responders and market makers also integrated and comfortable providing prices back on those orders. So it all takes a period of time, but this is one of the product areas where we feel the most confident with our launch in our history really based on the feedback that we are getting. And the municipal bond market is the significant opportunity. We think about $6 billion in average daily trading volume in the secondary market, so everything seems to be on track for us at this time.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Thanks. That’s really good color. I guess just based on the response you just gave, it seems like the new product launches are more about applying your current protocols in corporate trading and migrating that over and tweaking those. But I just wanted to understand or ask if you are more actively looking at potential M&A opportunities that could maybe help to kick start the growth for trading in those products?
Rick McVey: I don’t know that we see anything different in the M&A landscape than where we have commented in prior quarters. What we have been delivering and building to the market is unique. We have seven or eight protocols running that are built for the institutional credit markets. And we have been more successful with organic growth and organic technology developments. And I don’t see anything really changing there. And when you think about our mission, the institutional market combined with all-to-all trading through the Open Trading enhancements, it’s not obvious that there are acquisitions out there that would accelerate our path into any existing products or new products.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Thank you. And I guess my last question, sneak one in on capital. So it looks like the Board authorized $25 million 2-year repurchase plan, am I right to infer from this that you just plan to continue to use repurchases over the next 2 years just to offset equity dilution. And then, on the dividend increase of 30%, obviously a sizable increase, but relatively in line with your earnings growth in 2015, is there any reason why the Board didn’t maybe elect to bump up the payout ratio in 2015 a bit higher, given the growing cash from the balance sheet?
Tony DeLise: So Kyle, on the repurchase plan, we do have plan that expires at the end of February and you saw the $25 million authorization for the new plan. And just to put it in perspective, we are kind of offset dilution from equity grant that sort of rule of thumb to look at. If you look at grant value, equity grant value each year or if you look at stock-based compensation expense, that would give you a rule of thumb of what we would be anticipating from an annual repurchase standpoint. And we think that $25 million is – would offset dilution over the course of the next 2 years, that’s how we feel today, it can change, but that’s how we feel right now in terms of the plan we put in place. And on the dividend fees, you are right. Observationally, you are right that the 30% increase is in line with the increase in earnings in 2015. When I look longer term, the increase in net dividend over the past 5 years have outpaced our increase in free cash flow and our increase in earnings, so we are growing that dividend level. That strong earnings and that free cash flow generation, we can increase the dividend. We can still make investments in Open Trading and new products. We feel it’s the right balance right now between the dividend and share repurchases.
Rick McVey: And I just would add to that as well. We get a lot of feedback from our large investors on our capital management plan and consistently they like the steady growth that we have been delivering on the dividend and they like the strong balance sheet. So it’s a great position for the company to be in, to be increasing the dividend the way that we are building further strength in our balance sheet and investing organically. So we think we have that balance about right and that’s certainly the feedback that we are getting from our large investors.
Kyle Voigt: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Hugh Miller with Macquarie. You may begin.
Hugh Miller: Hi, good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning Hugh.
Tony DeLise: Good morning Hugh.
Hugh Miller: So just I guess I don’t want to belabor the point, but a couple of questions just on the new initiatives as well. As we think about kind of the competitive landscape, particularly within muni trading, how does that compare to what you are facing right now, is it primarily just going up against kind of the over the phone type trading or are there other people out there that are trying to sell that with solutions that the more electronic?
Rick McVey: Sure. I think what you see in the muni space is that there are a number of retail oriented municipal bond systems that have also been trying to move their liquidity pool up to the institutional client. I think in very small ticket sizes, they have had some success, but what we hear anecdotally is that most of those platforms have average ticket sizes of just $40,000 or $50,000. So, it’s really the microwatts for institutional clients that trade on those systems and not what they would view as their more significant order flow. The incumbent really for some form of electronic messaging is really Bloomberg, where they have functionality that allows the muni market to exchange order and price messages. The feedback we get is that, that is not a fully electronic solution that includes the competitive price discovery that didn’t offer list functionality that we deliver and the post-trade straight through processing. So, what we are picking up from clients is that this would represent a significant improvement in their electronic trading efficiency with this launch that we have on track for the second quarter.
Hugh Miller: Okay. And then of the active trade or clients that you now have for high-grade, high-yield, et cetera, how many of them would you say – I know you gave us a sense of who is launching with you, but how many of them actively trade in the muni space?
Tony DeLise: A significant number. We have done a lot of work on both the buy side and the sell side dynamic in the municipal space and we think about half of our target muni clients are already taxable clients on our system and another half are more muni specific that we are in the process of adding to the trading platform, but the largest global bond investors in that are already active on our platform also tend to be the largest municipal bond investors. So, in terms of percentage in the market that we already cover, we think it’s more than half. On the dealer side, as you know, Hugh, there are loads of regional dealers involved in the municipal bond market. So, that’s another area where the 60 or so that we expect to have live at launch probably represent about half of where we would expect to be a year from now. So, there are plenty of new dealers to add to the system, but they also tend to be smaller in size than the dealers that we already have live on the trading system.
Hugh Miller: Got it. That’s very helpful. And as we think about kind of that other credit category and variable pricing as we consider kind of some growth in the coming years from munis, leveraged loans, how does the fee capture there? Can you give us just a rough sense of what you are anticipating there relative to the other products?
Tony DeLise: Sure, Hugh. For munis, at launch date, what we intend on doing out was a tiered fee plan, which really based on ticket size and maturity. And what that equates to is a fee capture and I will give you a pretty broad range, but the fee capture will be somewhere between high-grade and high-yield, which happens to be where the other credit category sits right now. So, it is a pretty broad range and it’s going to be dependent on ticket size that they outset. In all likelihood, it probably favors smaller ticket sizes, which means higher fee capture, but think about the munis sitting sort of squarely in between high-grade and high-yield, which will be consistent with the other credit fee captures right now. And for loans, you are going to hear much of the same story, where it’s a pretty basic fee plan that we are launching with. And the fee capture right now, we expect, would look similar to what you see in that other credit category right now. So at least, at the outset, we don’t think it will influence the fee capture up or down in any significant way.
Hugh Miller: Certainly helpful. Makes it easier to model, I guess, where it will change the assumptions.
Tony DeLise: Agree. Agree.
Hugh Miller: And then just last for me, you gave us some color on the expected range for expenses. Can you just give us a sense as to the incremental costs for these new initiatives relative to incremental costs just for improving protocols and stuff like that with open trading? How should we think about just higher cost associated with the munis, leveraged loans, et cetera?
Tony DeLise: Yes, yes. And Hugh, in the prepared remarks, I made some comments about the midpoint of the range compared to our historical growth. And when you look at that uptick, if you isolate the discrete and incremental investment to launch these new products, that munis and loans, what we are looking at right now, it’s somewhere between $2 million to $3 million in expenses in 2016. And with any product launch, you have to build functionality, you integrate reference data, you connect clients and there is an effort there. Of that $2 million to $3 million, there is employee costs that are built in there. So, there is customer facing, employees and technologies that we have hired and will be hiring over the course of the year. There is also reference data that we have to subscribe to. So, that incremental spend, think about it for 2016, couple of million dollars might be more than that in 2017 as we ramp up the effort.
Hugh Miller: Very helpful. Great. Thank you very much.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Hugh.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Wong with Morningstar. You may begin.
Michael Wong: Good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Wong: Okay. So, more and more banks are possibly throwing in the towel on their fixed income trading business. What do you see as the balance between a subdued outlook for fixed trading as a whole versus issues specific to their business model?
Rick McVey: Well, I think you are right, the trend continues to be that some dealers are making decisions that they don’t want to be as actively involved in fixed income market making as they have in the past. And we know the challenge between the capital requirements and layers of compliance costs that have been added to the industry, the challenge for all of them is to achieve reasonable ROEs for their investors. So, some of those decisions are being made. I still think the backdrop here is the significant increase in credit debt outstanding around the world with numbers that are up around the 80% over the last 5 years. So, we are dealing with a much larger market that’s entering what could be a new period of increased volatility. And that volatility will lead to trading activity. And we think it’s part of our responsibility back to our clients to provide the tools to address the regulatory changes that are taking place and deliver new sources of liquidity so that we can efficiently move on to the system in what is now a much larger market with growing volatility.
Michael Wong: Okay, thanks for that. And it seems that the stock and derivative exchanges are putting together some of the pieces though of possibly a fixed income trading platform or adjusting credit more? Are there pieces that you believe you have that make you successful that they currently do not have?
Rick McVey: I am not sure exactly what you are referring to, but there is no change in what we view to be our most important competitive advantages. We have been investing in credit technology for 16 years with significant investment enhancements every single quarter. So, we have been at this a long time and we think we have got the broadest base of trading protocols available for the credit markets and we continue to add more. I suspect that our investment budget again this year will be larger than anyone else in the space in the coming year. And then secondly, we have obviously been very hard at work consistently on growing our client network and fully integrating them into our trading system. So, it’s very gratifying to see our active client list go over 1,000 firms in the last year. So, we have got a really broad and deep network of clients and we have an expansive set of trading protocols available for our clients and we see those as the most important competitive advantages. And as we have talked about during the call today, we are not standing still. We are investing more in the coming year and we expect to for the foreseeable future.
Michael Wong: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-21 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - IR Rick McVey - Chairman and CEO Tony DeLise - CFO
Analysts: Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Hugh Miller - Macquarie Kyle Voigt - KBW Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded October 21, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning. And welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. For the call Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer review the highlights for the quarter and will provide update on trends in our businesses and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey : Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2015 results. We reported solid results this quarter driven by continued momentum in market share gains across all of our core products with record estimated market share in U.S. high-grade and high-yield, this resulted in strong volume growth including a record quarter for high-yield and emerging market volumes. Total trading volumes were up 32% compared to the third quarter of last year. Revenues for the quarter were $74 million, up 16% year-over-year. Pre-tax income was $35 million up 25% and EPS was $0.60 up 30%. Expenses were up 8% to $39 million. Open trading adoption continues to build with new records for open trading volumes and participation. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. We saw some signs of changes in market environment in Q3 as concerns about global growth through credit spreads grow wider and mutual fund flows turned negative. Taxable bond funds saw outflow during the quarter following two consecutive quarters of inflows. At the same time, aggregate holdings of U.S. high-grade and high-yield bonds for market making by primary dealers continue to decline falling to a new low of $8 billion by the end of the quarter. Credit spreads widened almost 30 basis points during the quarter and credit spread volatility is on the rise. Combined U.S. high-grade and high-yield TRACE volumes were up slightly year-over-year while our Trax estimates through emerging market and euro bond volumes were down. High-grade new issuance was 18% higher than the previous year and high-grade and high-yield corporate debt outstanding is now over $8 trillion. Slide 5 highlighted the breadth and depth of our trading platform. In order to navigate the liquidity challenges in today's credit markets, we believe market participants give the ability to access order flow from the widest possible network together with a broad set of trading protocols. 957 firms were active on MarketAxess during the third quarter up 14% from a year ago. Broad client engagement helped drive total [indiscernible] volume up by 51% year-over-year. Total inquiry count was up 43%. We are continuously expanding and enhancing our range of innovative trading options for all trade sizes. Our protocols including market lists and client access are fully integrated into the workflow of our RFQ model, as a result we are delivering enhanced liquidity to our clients in an easy and efficient manner. Additional tools such as workup functionality and dark [order] bring greater flexibility to the trade process and increase the probability of finding a trade match without information leakage. We continue to see significant activity in block trade. During the third quarter, 66% of our high grade volume was in trade sizes over $1 million and 21% of our volume was in trade sizes over $5 million. The number of trades on the platform greater than $5 million in size increased by 27% compared to the third quarter of last year. 9% of all our block trades over $5 million reported to TRACE during Q3 were done on MarketAxess. Slide 6 provides an update on open trading. Open traded volumes and client participation showed strong momentum during the quarter. A record 45,000 open trading transactions were completed up 125% year-over-year and trade volume was $23 billion for the quarter up 130%. 421 firms provided all-to-all liquidity during Q3 up from 262 one year ago. This growing engagement from market participants created 100,000 additional price responses for open orders during the quarter.  We continue to see a broad cross-section of firms active in open trading with dealers winning 40% trades while only asset managers winning 35% and other market participants winning 25%. While we are encouraged by the early growth of open trading, only about one third of large investors have embedded all-to-all trading in their daily trade process. We believe this bodes well for future growth. Over a 13% of U.S. high grade and high yield volume on the platform now takes place through open trading protocols and market participants continue to benefit from transaction costs savings of more than 3 basis point in yield when they complete the US high-grade trading in open trading.  Slide 7 provides an update on Europe. Our European business continues to grow with the 65% year-over-year increase in trading volumes of European clients during Q3. In addition to euro bond training European clients are increasingly active with us in emerging markets debt and U.S. credit products. The enhancements that we made to the European platform earlier this year have been well-received. By providing the clients the choice to send their order flow to a broader number of dealers we have been able to attract eight new dealers to the European platform in just the last two quarters. The enhanced liquidity of the European system is driving our hit rates higher.  We're also encouraged by the rapid adoption of open trading in Europe with 65% of euro bond increase now being submitted to market list. As such technical standards for MiFID II were finalized last month, the regulations will require increased regulatory transaction reporting for both buy and sell site firms and will aim to bring greater premium post trade transparency to European markets.  We believe that the implementation of these rules is likely to create greater demand for electronic trading, market data, and post trade services. In advance of these regulatory changes, our innovative data products are already providing benefits to clients through increased transparency and our data revenues are up 18% year-over-year.  Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a closer look at our quarterly financial results. 
Tony DeLise: Thank you Rick. Please turn to slide 8 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were $240 billion up from $182 billion one year ago. U.S. high grade volumes were $140 billion for the quarter up 28% in the third quarter of 2014. The improvement in high grade volume was attributable to the loss of increase in estimated market share, combine with a 10% year-over-year increase in estimated U.S. high-grade trades volume.  Volumes in the other credit category were up 49% year-over-year driven by order flow increase to the [indiscernible] products. For the third consecutive quarter, we reported record trading volumes for high-yield and emerging market bond. And euro bond trading volume was up over 80% year-over-year. Trax and TRACE data indicates that overall emerging markets and euro bond market volumes were down by about 20% and high-yield market volume was up approximately 7% year-over-year. This means that the vast majority of volume growth in our other credit category resulted from market share gains. Slide 9, displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $74.2 million were up 16% from a year ago driven by the estimated market share gains and resulting growth in commission revenue. The stronger dollar dampened year-over-year revenue growth by 130 basis points or approximately $800,000. Total expenses were $38.8 million up 8% in the third quarter of 2014. As the impact of the stronger dollar, the expense increase was approximately 10% year-over-year. Operating margin expanded by 370 basis points year-over-year to 48%.  The third quarter effective cash rate was consistent with the year-to-date rate of 35.5%. At this point we expect that the full-year 2015 effective tax rate will be around 150 basis points below the full year 2014 level. Our diluted EPS was $0.60 on a diluted share count of 37.6 million shares. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 26% year-over-year as a 32% increase in trading volume was offset by 4% decline in total transaction fees per million. Our U.S. high-grade [indiscernible] is influenced by a number of factors including the duration of bonds traded on the platform, trade size and dealer mix. Most of the $10 per million sequential decline high-grade [indiscernible] was due to the migration of two dealers during the third quarter from all the variable fee plans to the distribution fee plan.  The migrations were roughly revenue neutral. The sequential and year-over-year decline in the other trade category fees per million was principally due to our mix shift within this category with a heavier weighting to euro bonds and emerging markets sovereign bonds. U.S. high-grade distribution fees were up almost $1.3 million sequentially on a combination of the dealer migration impact and higher unused minimum fees on the all variable plan. We currently expect two dealers to migrate from the distribution fee plan to the all variable high-grade fee plan, resulting from a reduction in their market making business models. Fourth quarter distribution fees are projected to be approximately $1 million lower than the third quarter levels with some offset in variable transaction fees. Slide 11, provides you with the expense details. Total third quarter expenses were up $400,000 from the second quarter level. The sequential change in the fully compensation was due to an increase in headcounts from 311 at June 30 to 335 at September month end. The majority of headcount expansion related to sales and technology personnel in support of open trend and other initiatives. On a year-over-year basis the 13% growth in compensation benefits was due to a combination of higher variable bonus accrual which is tied directly to operating performance, higher equity-based compensation and higher salaries expense on an increase in headcount. In the aggregate non-compensation, cost were up less than 3% year-over-year. Higher clearing costs reflected in the G&A line was offset by lower IT consulting cost and lower technology related cost. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available for sale as of September 30, were $256 million and trailing 12 month free cash flow reached $103 million. During the third quarter we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $7.3 million and repurchased 58,000 shares at a cost $5.6 million under our share buyback program. As of September 30, approximately $42 million was available for repurchases under the program. Our board approved a $0.20 regular quarterly dividend payable on November 18, to record holders on November 4, there was no change in our capital structure during the third quarter; we have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks Tony. We are encouraged by the growth trends in our business across products and regions. The strength in corporate bond liquidity are becoming more pronounced driving greater demand for alternative sources of secondary market liquidity. We continue to invest actively to deliver valuable technology solutions to our clients for trading, data and post-trade services.  Now I will be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Adams of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Mike Adams: Good morning gentlemen. A question here on open trading, Rick you mentioned that in terms of customer penetration about a third of your long only customers are active with the open trading protocol, are they all responding with prices to increase?
Rick McVey: I would say they are all responding, I think that the group that does respond is probably closer to 70% of the top investors that use the system, the ones that are doing so regularly and actively are the one-third of that group that I mentioned, so each quarter we see an increased base of investors that are changing their trading process in order to be able to respond and I would say even for those that don't respond electronically, they are seeing a much more trade opportunity through the open order book than ever before and they do have the ability to provide prices through one of their dealer counterparties to submit through the system. So it’s quite possible that the impact on the open orders is broader than we see on the fully electronic trade responses.
Mike Adams: Got it, thanks. And then I think you guys did a nice job of explaining some of the pricing dynamics in the third quarter but can you talk more broadly about some of your pricing plans outside of high-grade, the other credit products, the price there has been static, but we’ve seen the liquidity pool increase substantially, so just trying to figure out what the long term trajectory is there, like any potential changes that are maybe on the drawing board for other credit?
Tony DeLise: Mike its Tony. So on the pricing side, I'd say that we’re spending more time thinking about pricing in some cases, we are -- we’d would like to from our behavior, so for example in open trading we do have situations where we are promoting participation and discounting pricing. Right now on the other products in that category, we have made some changes over the years to our euro bond pricing model, we have a variety of programs and dealer choices for those programs, we feel pretty static right now as to with high-yield and emerging markets where those progress have been in an existence for a while and we think that the program or the pricing model that scales better is when where its take or pay model, right now those are dealer pay models, its little too early to say really not we would change anything there. But we continue to think more about pricing and how we can [incentive] in that case.
Mike Adams: Got it and may be somewhat related to this but Rick could you update us on the competitive market environment, we touch on it every quarter, but there has been quite a few new launches, and one established equity platform that recently made a pretty high profile entrance in to corporate bond trading, so have you seen or heard of any changes from your competitors there?
Rick McVey: I don't think there is -- during the third quarter there is anything substantial that's changed in the competitive landscape, but I continue to believe that the big challenge is getting client connectivity establish to the point where trade matches are possible on some of the new entrance, and nothing that we see in the competitive landscape would suggested that anything has changed during the third quarter. And you can see there our growth numbers have done nothing but accelerate, so we feel very good about our competitive position, we continue to expand the platform in terms of the number of participants, the protocols offered, the orders available on the platform and right now we do believe that our competitive position is as strong as ever.
Mike Adams: Got and one last one from me and then I’ll get back in the queue, but Tony in terms of comp, you noted that I think you added about 24 employees during the quarter, can you talk about -- one, like what the -- what the pipeline looks like in terms of open positions you are trying to fill before year end and then just in terms of the timing of those adds was it more front quarter or back quarter weighted.
Tony DeLise: Yes, Mike so we did in the quarter with 335 employees, it was a very active period for us in terms of hiring. I will say most of those hires were -- they were in sales which are revenue generating positions and in technology and just to give you a little bit of color was with both in support of new initiatives like open trading geographic expansion, and that mix just from a geographic standpoint was around 50% in the U.S. and 50% outside of the U.S. And it was probably evenly -- little bit evenly distributed maybe a little bit backend in that case. There is still handful of open positions that we’re hiring for right now. It's tough to predict where will end the year, but we do expect to hire several additional positions over the course of the fourth quarter. And barring any attrition, we’ll be up slightly at the year-end. And what I'm telling you there is if you look at the comp expense and all else equal we would expect that comp expense to decrease up a little bit in the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Your line is now open. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I want to follow up on that last question about the growth of your sales capacity. To what extent has your sales model changed as you rolled that more open trading and try to push block trading. And as just you adapt to the business model, has your sales model changed or are you just trying to have more contact points and just get in front of people more often?
Rick McVey: I think it's a combination of the latter and the fact that we are serving more dealers and clients than ever before right now. When you look at the increase in the client base both investors and dealers over the last year is significant, the improvement in Europe is partly because the technology enhancements and partly because we've significantly increased our sales force to work actively with European clients. So I believe it's a little bit of both, but as we add clients and we add more protocols and products to the trading platform we will also continue to add sales resources to make sure that we’re in front of our clients regularly. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then moving on to the competition topic. So certainly some of the competitors are trying to compete on the basis of price, not necessarily in the near term but over the long-term how well do you think you guys are positioned against price competition? How stable do you think your pricing model is going to be over the long-term?
Rick McVey: Well it's pretty clear over the long-term it's been extremely stable. And remember Patrick in the world of credit, transaction fees are very small part of the net cost of the transaction to the client. And when we see an open trading that we’re delivering more than 3 basis points in yield savings to the client, that’s the most relevant factor to them, is what is the liquidity pool doing to lower their transaction costs, and when you look at our transaction fee relative to that level of savings for the client, it's still very small. And this is not new Patrick, you know from following us for many years that most competitors have tried to compete on price, and the reality is our liquidity pool is unique and the protocols that we have available consistently drive a lower-cost of transactions to the clients that use our system.  So I think looking at commissions is just one part of the equation. The competition is really about who can deliver the best net cost to the client and our liquidity pool has consistently done that. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: From the data that we’re looking at it looks like October industrywide trading loans have been very healthy, I think particularly in high yield bonds, what do you ascribe that to and then I guess how do you kind of square that with everybody’s concerned about getting access to liquidity, it doesn't seem like that has been a big constraint right now.
Rick McVey: The early few weeks of October you're right, the U.S. numbers are up. I think it's a lot of one time flow from an active period in M&A, the HP restructuring and significant amount of that activity in 144As. So some of it is situational that’s not likely to be sustained over longer periods of time. When we look at emerging market in euro bond volumes we don't see the same kind of growth rates although euro bonds have bounced backed from the seasonal lows in the third quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugh Miller of Macquarie. Your line is now open. 
Hugh Miller : So a couple of questions, one I appreciate the color you guys gave on the adjustments for 4Q with the two dealers that are going to move away from the all you can trade platform, typically when we think about kind of dealers migrating upward you guys always talk about its relatively revenue neutral in the near-term. In this case can you talk about how we should be thinking about the potential volume commission offset from the reduction in the 60s? 
Tony DeLise: You are right. Typically when we have migrations from the variable plan up to the distribution fee plan in the short-term it is revenue neutral. In this case in the fourth quarter what we’re tracking we have two dealers who have -- they've really changed the business model and changed their market making capacity and they will be rolling off of the distribution fee planned and if we just look at their activity for the third quarter -- I would tell you in this case it is likely not to be revenue neutral and we would have some offset from the reduction in distribution fees with an increase in variable transaction fees but it would not be revenue neutral.
Hugh Miller : Okay, so we should just think about potentially a moderate or a modest offset on the transactional side relative to the contraction -- the $1 million contraction and fixed rate fees?
Tony DeLise: And I do say, all else equal, because you know that there is lots of items that impact that high-grade fee capture including duration and dealer plan mix, and trade size, and protocols there's lots of influence but just in isolation, yes you're right.
Hugh Miller : And did you guys -- I didn't catch it, did you guys update your expense guidance for the year? I'll leave it there.
Tony DeLise: No, we didn't update, so that original expense guidance still stands which was at this stage is a pretty broad range of 153 million to 159 million, if you look at where we were through the first nine months and then just did some simple arithmetic and assume the fourth quarter similar to the third quarter, it's going to get you somewhere around 154 million or 155 million. So, in somewhere squarely within the range, we’re still tracking a couple of items that are variable that -- that variable incentive bonus which is tied to operating performance could swing it up or down, the headcount growth which I think again I'm pretty certain that the salary expense line will increase just given the recent headcount growth, we always track foreign exchange impact so that could swing it one way or another, but we're going to be squarely in the middle of that range or maybe a little bit below the middle of that range.
Hugh Miller : Sure, sure. And you guys had given some color with regard to kind of the other credit category for pricing there obviously seeing a shift towards more euro bond. Within EM, can you just remind us again about the fee capture between corporate and sovereign blend, what you're seeing there and how we should be thinking about the trends there and the fee capture on a go-forward basis for that part?
Tony DeLise: What we talked about before, we have and we haven't changed our fee plans for emerging markets and that mix between corporate and sovereign does matter and -- we look at EM, it's -- you can think about it in three buckets, we have emerging market external corporate debt, we have an emerging market external sovereign and we have an emerging market local markets sovereign debt and that mix right now is about 40% external corporate, 40% external sovereign, 20% local market sovereign. Where we've seen the growth over the past year has been in sovereign debt and even though all three of those buckets have grown year-over-year the growth has been in sovereign debt trading and in particular in local markets trading, there we've added more dealers, more market making dealers, we had more currencies that were making markets and we had put out a release about a month and a half ago on activity in the local markets area and that trading volume is up around 200% year-over-year. So, just from a mix standpoint it matters and rough number, the fee capture for corporate emerging markets is about double the fee capture for sovereign bonds. That figure about 150 million or so per million for sovereign's and 300 plus for corporates.
Hugh Miller : That's very helpful, that's kind of where I think where the disparity came with what we're modeling out. Is there anything that would kind of cause you to see that changing in the coming quarters? Obviously nobody has a crystal ball, but any trends you're seeing there or should we continue to expect to see the sovereign growing as a percentage of the total?
Tony DeLise: From a geographic standpoint we are spending more time in Latin America and in the Asia Pacific region we've added resources there, we've added dealer liquidity there -- and if that trend continues in terms -- and driving local markets trading forward, you could see some compression there, but a lot of this is market conditions related as well, you look over the past year, emerging market volumes are down significantly and it is a bit episodic so it's a little difficult to predict that mix between corporates and sovereigns.
Hugh Miller : And with regard to -- we talked a little bit about the overall October volumes that we're seeing in the U.S. and outside, what are you guys seeing in regard to market share for U.S. high-grade so far in October?
Rick McVey: It's very early -- we're just little over half way through the month. So, hard to make our conclusions about where the month [well along] the quarter might end up. When we look across our four products there are not huge surprises. As I mentioned earlier there are some M&A situations driving growth in high grade trading activity especially in 144A, they're not the kind of trades that we would typically place -- take part in a large way. So, the monthly number is a bit softer in high grade, but it's too early to draw any major conclusions.
Hugh Miller : And last from me, there have been some discussions about you guys looking at some ancillary markets, communities and others, was wondering if you could give us an update on kind of your thoughts there, how we should be thinking about your moving forward and any incremental costs and a longer term opportunities to grow in those segments.
Rick McVey: Yes, [as we are] talking to clients, its clear that the liquidity challenges stretch far beyond just the credit areas that we offer today, so we are getting more and more regular request from our clients to expand the product offering that we have on our system, and quite honestly, we’ve been investing very actively through this year in open trading in Europe and we’re really encouraged with the returns from those investments. So we are hard at work thinking about ways that we can better serve our clients with expanding the products that on the trading system. So we have three main areas that we’re looking closely at and I think its likely that in the new year, you are going to see us get involved in more markets, we’ve had our request from our clients in the municipal bond market for leverage loan trading and we are also expanding our service offering to the ETF community and I think those three product areas are likely to feature in the New Year.
Hugh Miller : Okay that's helpful and then typically when we look at expense growth from your guys, we’re looking at mid to high single-digits as we think about the expansion there, obviously its not something that's going to be revenue or earnings accretive in the near term, but how should we be thinking about the incremental cost of some of those investments as we think about the growth rate for expenses next year?
Rick McVey: I’m not sure about your question about earnings accretive. Obviously the expense increase this year has been earnings accretive. So our earnings are up by 30% this quarter and the expense rate is up and its all because of our confidence in the long term growth of this business. These challenges brought on by regulatory change are life spread and we believe that we can continue to deliver technology solutions to our clients that will help with the changes in market structures they are taking place. So we think the exact right thing for the company to be doing at this time is expanding our staff to be able to deliver broader and deeper solutions to our clients to deal with the changes that are taking place. And we have had great returns on the investments that we’ve made, 30% earnings growth this quarter and 48% margins I think reflects that we are investing in the right areas and I think we are going to invest as we see opportunities in the New Year. Has it radically changed the expense run rate increases that we’ve seen in the past, no it has not. We would not expect it to in the New Year either, but we are investing and one of the things I feel best about in the third quarter is the quality of the staff that we are able to attract to the companies that help us grow the business for many years out. So I do think we’re going to continue to add staff just because we see a very large opportunity in the future.
Hugh Miller : Sure that's helpful. I apologize, I wasn’t implying that the investments you have made historically haven't been accretive, they absolutely have. I was thinking about it in terms of just think about municipals, levered loans, fixed income EPS, I assume you aren’t spending a lot of money at this point, but if you are making a push next year to expand there that the growth and expenses might kind of be a bit ahead of seeing any revenue contribution from that type of investment until we see kind of substantial volumes being attracted there. Maybe I’m thinking about it incorrectly but…
Rick McVey: I think that you are, we are leveraging installed network of nearly 1000 active investors and dealer firms that use our trading system and 15 years of investment in technology and protocols. And as a result our incremental cost to get into new markets are relatively low and the work to attract clients is negligible. So we will add staff but I think our ability to see volume and revenue in earnings contributions from new products is much better than it would be with brand new entrance to the market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is now open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions were answered, so I’ll just -- few one on capital, if the cash balance is up again in the third quarter around $266 million now, I think as you said in the last call that you are happy enough with the cash balance as of June 30 to support your open trading initiatives, which I guess implies there is some excess cash in the balance sheet, which we again expect to grow in the fourth quarter, I guess you have done special dividends in the past, I am just trying to understand whether there is any change in the thinking at the board level with respect to preference for returning cash to shareholders? Thanks.
Rick McVey: Today we have two standing programs in place to return capital and that’s the returning dividend and we have the share buyback. We’re reviewing our capital plans with the Board every quarter we do speak to and listen to our shareholders as well and you can see a pattern, at least in the dividend you can see the pattern where it's a typically a once a year exercise in January where we’re revisiting the level of that recurring quarterly dividend. We also like having a standing repurchase plan in place and at a minimum offsetting dilution there. Clearly we have lots of flexibility today, but I'll tell you that the plan in the short-term is to stay the course. The plan is to continue with the recurring quarterly dividend in the short-term, the plan is to continue to execute on the share buyback program. And also in January I'm pretty sure you will hear from us on the thoughts around what we’re doing with the recurring quarterly dividend. 
Kyle Voigt: And then just on the core business. I guess just on Europe, obviously you are gaining share in the total market given the growth in euro bonds and emerging markets. So I'm just wondering if there is anything you can say anecdotally as to whether this is kind of just electronic trading growing in Europe or whether you're taking share from a large incumbent electronic platform up there?
Rick McVey: We believe it's probably a little bit of both. I think the demand for electronic trading is growing in all regions but the pace of our growth in Europe is well beyond the overall markets, so part of it reflects taking market share away from some of the other electronic trading venues in the region. And I think it's a combination where we’re offering unique protocols that have proven to deliver better transaction cost to our clients and we have increased our sales resources to be in front of more clients. And we’re encouraged by the early results but it is early days in Europe, we are not where we want to be, we have a lot more work to do but we think we’re on the right track in the client response to the changes that we have made this year has been very good. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
Ashley Serrao: So first question just to circle back on October. I was wondering if you could just size the adjusted volume number once you back out the 144As and back to backs, so give us a base [indiscernible] market share?
Rick McVey: I'm not sure I understand the question. The TRACE numbers are obviously public Ashely, so…
Ashley Serrao: No, the way you adjusted, you mentioned that 144As outsize this quarter so far this month and there is some high yield related M&A activity that you're not really participating in. So I was just curious if you could know [now] that further. 
Rick McVey: Actually on October, and this is for high grade, typically 144A it runs something like 10% or 11% or 12% of total high grade TRACE volume. But it's pretty consistent pattern on 144A. In October what we’re seeing is 144As over 20% of TRACE volume. So we’re seeing a significant increase in the percentage high grade TRACE volume in 144A. 
Ashley Serrao: The next question I had was just on the ongoing dealer migrations, I was just curious how many dealers are when you look at your current client roster, are there a lot of dealers who are in a position where it just makes more sense to transfer from a variable to a fixed refund?
Tony DeLise: Ashley, just based on the parameters of the variable fee plan and the distribution fee plan, just purely looking at that on an economic decision there probably are not many in the queue that would move one way or another. Today we have 30 dealers on the distribution fee plan for high-grade around 40 on the variable plan. There is a couple of dealers on that variable plan who economically maybe bumping up against a move, but there is lots that goes into their decisions and it's difficult to predict but right now we’re not [of the two] that I mentioned we’re not tracking any other moves currently. 
Ashley Serrao: And then just a question on this open trading. I understand if you are discounting pricing incentivized behavior. So just curious that the two-thirds clients who haven't really embedded your solutions and protocols into their workflow, what [indiscernible] over the finish line?
Rick McVey: I think it's happening every quarter, I think trading behavior with institutional investors is slow to change, but I think the combination of accessing liquidity through traditional means are getting more difficult and the success that we’re having delivering new sources of liquidity is moving more and more clients our way each quarter.
Ashley Serrao: Okay. And then when I just look at TRACE crossable activity, it's seems like high yield demand activity that's crossable by [indiscernible] as far as high yield goes continues to increase, I am just curious that you could give us any inside into what's driving that and yes really what's driving that because it's going to divert from I guess investment grade which seem relatively flat?
Rick McVey: I am not sure I fully understand the question; you are looking inside TRACE at the crossing opportunity?
Ashley Serrao: Yes.
Rick McVey: Sort of that might be the story bond in high yield that has been very active recently around some of the upgrades and downgrades in M&A activity. So that you might be seeing short term package of concentration around certain issues over bonds, within -- well we see in open trading the demand track and trade runs greatest for our least liquid bonds and we do see higher percentages of our volume that completed in open trading in high yield and we do an high-grade, which make consecutive sense to us is that where it's most difficult to access traditional liquidity, people are seeking new protocols at through open trading define the other side of the trade.
Operator: Thank you and [Operator Instructions] our next question comes from Mike Adams of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Mike Adams: One last one, I don’t think we really touched on the regulatory environment and there was a recent development when the SEC proposed new liquidity risk management rules for mutual funds, seems like this could create some additional demand for your data services, so just wanted you to comment on this opportunity and maybe give a sense for how large this can be, will it really move the needle for the data business?
Rick McVey: I think you are absolutely right, we see that increase in demand for data products coming through on both the U.S. and the European side, so the early days of liquidity stress testing for investment management portfolios, really requires quality products around turn over and volume statistics for the underlying securities. So we are seeing growth in incoming inquiries on that front in both regions. When you look at the European side, there are also best execution guidelines [and message too] that are increasing demand for both data products which we have in Trax as well TCA analytics. So I think over the next 18 to 24 months Mike, you are absolutely right that goes because regulatory changes are likely to drive demand around data products.
Operator: Thank you and at this time I would like to turn the call over to Rick McVey for closing remark.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And u may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-22 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - IR Manager Rick McVey - Chairman, CEO Tony DeLise - CFO
Analysts: Kyle Voigt - KBW Hugh Miller - Macquarie Ashley Serrao - CreditSuisse Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded July 22, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning. And welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. For the call Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer review the highlights for the quarter and provide an update on trends in our businesses and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year-ended December 31, 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2015 results. This morning we reported strong results for the second quarter on a back of record volumes across our core products U.S. high-grade, high-yield and emerging market volumes. Total trading volumes were record $245 billion up 32% compared to the second quarter of last year. Continued strong momentum in market share gains drove our record volumes with estimated adjusted U.S. high-grade market share up 3 percentage points year-over-year, this was the third consecutive quarter that we achieved year-over-year estimated share gains in U.S. high-grade of more than 2 percentage points. This increase in volumes and share grow our robust year-over-year revenue growth of 16% to $76 million. Pre-tax income was $37 million up 28% compared to last year and EPS was $0.64 up from $0.48. Volumes from European clients were up 44%. The number of active European clients continues to grow and was up 26% from a year ago. We continue to develop unique data products and post-trade solutions in the region to help our dealers and investor clients prepare for their new and extensive regulatory obligations under MiFID II. Open trading adoption rates continued at a healthy pace during the quarter with record open trading participation and trading volumes. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Credit spreads and credit spread volatility remain above year ago levels. Combined U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes were up 6% year-over-year with down slightly from Q1. New issuance remained a close to record levels with $328 billion in U.S. high-grade issue during the quarter. U.S. high-grade and highyield debt outstanding is now close to $8 trillion. The boom in corporate -- over the last five years has lead to a significant increase in a number of corporate bond issuers and a number of corporate bonds outstanding. This has caused the markets become more fragmented with more issues trading each month and less concentration of volume in the actively traded 1,000 corporate bonds. The increase fragmentation in the market combined with the increased bank regulations places further strength on secondary market liquidity. U.S. highgrade and highyield market volume in July are off to a weaker start compared to the second quarter of 2015 but are in line with July 2014 levels. Slide five provides an update on open trading. We are very pleased with the continued growth in open trading participation this quarter. Completed open trading transactions more than doubled year-over-year to 38,000 and open trading volume was $21 billion, up 153% compared to the second quarter of 2014. 375 different firms provided open trading liquidity during the quarter, up from 260 a year ago with liquidity being provided by a diverse group of firms. 41% of market list trades were won by a traditional long only assets managers, 35% by dealers and 24% by alternative liquidity providers, such as -- market makers and hedge funds. Among our most active buy side clients, approximately 30% are regularly acting as price makers on the platform with many more working on adapting their internal training process to enable more -- engagement with open trading. According to a recent investors survey by Woodbine Associates 60% of respondents planned to increase their use of MarketAxess open trading and 60% plan to break up log trades into multiple smaller transactions. Over 500 firms benefitted from this new liquidity by completing an open trading transaction representing over half of our active system participants during the quarter. In the second quarter open trading represented approximately 10% of our U.S. trading activity, up from 5% during the second quarter of 2014. The increased efficiency and access to our extensive all to all trading network continue to generate significant cost seedings for participants along average 3 basis points in yield or about $1,800 per million traded in U.S. highgrade. We continue to invest heavily to enhance our open trading protocols to provide our clients with a broad range of trading options for all trade sizes and we believe that there is significant runway ahead for open trading adaption. Slide six provides insights into our U.S. highgrade market-share gains. We saw increased momentum in our market-share gains during the quarter. Our analysis shows a positive correlation overtime between credit spread volatility and broken our market-share. Greater volatility in the market was one of the drivers of our record share. Share growth has been consistent across all trade sizes and we are especially encouraged by our growing share of log trading. During the second quarter, 72% of volume traded on MarketAxess was in trade sizes of over $1 million and 20% of volume on the platform was over $5 million in size. Our block trade account increased 35% from the second quarter of last year. Increased regulatory obligations including compliance requirements under the Volcker rule that came into effect this week are putting further pressure on secondary market liquidity particularly for larger trade sizes. According to FINRA in 2009 trades greater than $25 million in size made up 23% of trades volumes and so far in 2015 trades of this size make up only 14% of trades volumes. This suggest that investors are increasingly breaking up large blocks into smaller trades. Client inquiry count on the platform was up 34% year-over-year demonstrating growing engagement as investors seek to utilize our all-to-all marketplace to access new sources of global liquidity. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tony for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 7 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were up 32% year-over-year to $245 billion. U.S. high-grade volumes were a record $149 billion for the quarter, up 28% from the second quarter of 2014. The majority of the high-grade volume gain was attributable to an increase in estimated market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 42% compared to the second quarter of 2014 driven by an over 50% increase in order flow. We registered record trading volumes for high-yield in emerging market bonds and continued substantial growth in euro bond trading volume. Trax and TRACE data indicate that overall emerging markets and euro bond market volumes declined by 15% or more where high-yield market volume was up approximately 6% year-over-year. This means that market share gain more than offset the overall market volume challenges. Slide 8 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $75.5 million were up 16% from a year ago driven by the estimated market share gains and resulting growth in commission revenue. For the second consecutive quarter the stronger dollar dampened revenue growth by approximately $900,000. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, information in post-trade service revenue, the majority of which is derived from our Trax business was up 3%. The drop in technology products and services revenue reflects the lying down of a professional services engagement. Prospectively, we expect this revenue line item to taper modestly from the second quarter level. Total expenses were $38.4 million up 7% from the second quarter of 2014. Absent the impact of the stronger dollar, the expense increase was approximately 10% year-over-year. Operating margin expanded more than 400 basis points year-over-year to 49%. The effective tax rate was 34.6% for the second quarter and 35.4% on a year-to-date basis. The year-to-date effective tax rate is running approximately 150 basis points below the 2014 level and reflects an income shift to lower tax rate jurisdiction and a reduction in certain statutory foreign and state tax rates. We are updating our full year 2015 guidance range and now expect the effective tax rate will be between 35% and 36.5%. Our diluted EPS was $0.64 on a diluted share count of 37.6 million shares. The year-over-year decline in our diluted share count was principally due to share repurchases. On Slide 9, we've laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 32% year-over-year consistent with the growth in trading volume. Our U.S. high-grade fee tax was influenced by a number of factors including the duration of bonds traded on the platform. On sequential basis, lower duration on slightly higher yield and slightly lower duration on slightly higher yields and slightly lower average years to maturity accounted for the declines in the US high-grade fees per million. The sequential uptake in the other credit category fees per million was previously due to mix shift within this category with the heavier weighting in the current period to high-yield bonds and lower weighting to euro bonds. Distribution fees were consistent with the first quarter level. Slight 10 provides you with the expense detail. Total second quarter expenses were consistent with the first quarter level. And more granular level, the decline in compensation of benefits was largely attributable to seasonally higher first quarter employment taxes and benefits of $800,000 offset by an increase in wages on some headcount expansion. The sequential market expense increase reflects greater strength on advertising campaign customer events and sales activities. On the year-over-year basis the 12% growth and compensation and benefits was due to a combination of higher variable bonus accruals which is tied directly to operating performance and higher equity based compensation. The year-over-year change in non-compensation cost was consistent with variations over the past several quarters. Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the significant investment in product enhancement and technology over the past several years, professional consulting fees decline on lower IP consulting cost and G&A expenses increased mainly due to higher clearing cost. We still expect full year 2015 expenses will be within our expense guidance range. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available for sale as of June 30th, were $237 million and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached $100 million. During the second quarter, we paid our quarterly cash dividend of $7.5 million and repurchased 63,000 shares at a cost of $5.5 million under our share buyback program. At the June 30th, approximately $48 million was available for future repurchases under the program. Our board approved the $0.20 regular quarterly dividend payable on August 20, to record hold on August 6, there was no change in our capital structure during the second quarter; we have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks Tony. We are encouraged by the trends evident in our business during the second quarter. Investors and dealers are using market access for a growing proportion of their secondary trading needs, new open trading solutions are providing a much neat expansion of the secondary liquidity pool. We see many opportunities that had in this new regulatory environment to serve our clients with innovative technology solutions for pre-trade data trade execution and post-trade reporting and matching. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kyle Voigt: Hi thank you for taking my questions. I guess touching on the non-commission revenue on technology line, sorry I heard you say that you expect revenue to taper from here, by this exactly what the decrease was cause by and then just on the information in post-trade revenue, I know you said its some effects headwinds in the release, so I just wondering if you happen to have the organic growth rate on a constant currency basis?
Tony DeLise: Two questions there on tax service and then information on post-trade. The first one on tech service if that revenue line item, it was combination of professional services where we are project managing for companies in our space there are some software licensing and maintenance in support all of the net tech services line item, its not a big piece of our revenue plan and today really not a core emphasis report area, this is for us. We did have one, we’ve mentioned in our prepared remarks one engagement in the second quarter, we were using contractors to deliver much of that engagement that's one of the reason you see decline in professional and consulting fee. And prospectively I mentioned that we are tapered -- that line item will be somewhere around $500,000 per quarter in the near-term. Quite frankly we are probably going to vary that line item in other income building or it is just not of the year event. And -- one more thing to note on that, this is not a high margin product or business for us even though with the decline we did not have a material impact on earnings. And you could see where our focus is, we are focused today on our core opportunity credit -- right now. So that handles the fact services piece. You did have that information in post trading. If you are thinking about the year-over-year, the year-over-year gains, it was excluding foreign currency was about 3% year-over-year. But when you take a deeper dive on that one, we had two areas within information for post trade about 40% of our revenue is post trade reporting and matching that is very much tied to market volume about 60% today is in data products. And when you look at year-over-year, adjusting for foreign currency it's up about 3%. That does not tell the whole story, because when we look at data revenue in local currency or excluding the impact of foreign currency, data revenue is up about 17% year-over-year, much of that was from our -- where we are delivering new data products market and liquidity products, where we saw the decline in information post trade was in post trade services tied to market volumes when you look at overall Eurobond equity market volumes in that region, it was down year-over-year. So it maps a little bit -- the improvement in data revenues maps a little bit by the decline in post trade volume.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Thanks Tony, it's really helpful. Next on the follow up on the post trade line. I guess on the Axess All product in Europe, I guess last quarter you mentioned that you would potentially reevaluate the pricing of this product in the coming months. And so I was just wondering if there is any update there with respect to either charging for the product or having plans to do so?
Rick McVey: No real change. We are seeing growing adaption of the Axess All real time trade tape by both dealers and investors and have some plans in the coming quarter to deliver that through API which will make it even more efficient for our clients. We do see consistent and growing demand for all of our volume products which made sense that dealers are trying to determine on a more quantitative basis, the likely demands for bonds that they may be making markets in and clients are trying to better measure liquidity in their portfolios. So we are seeing very good growth around the volume products within the tracks data.
Kyle Voigt: Okay. Thanks. And then just last one from me and I will get back in line. Just on capital, you currently have $237 million in cash in the balance sheet and -- built in the back-half of the year. And I know you previously said that you want to keep excess cash in the balance sheet just to facilitate open trading. But I guess the first question is low level, do you feel that you have enough cash to adequately support open trading if are not there already? And then if you did have enough additional cash above that level at year-end will be the preferred mean to return that cash to shareholders? Thanks.
Tony DeLise: On the capital management and on the cash; the first part of your question in support of open trading; we do feel that we have adequate capital today to support what we are doing in open trading. And just as a reminder what we are doing in open trading, does not affect the regulatory capital, but we are cautiously holding excess capital in our regulated businesses to support the open trading initiative. And we are comfortable with that cash position today, given the level of activity. We do think having a healthy capital -- clients or counterparties is comfortable with taking credit. So in terms of the amount of cash we do believe we have enough to support our business.  Right now, our capital management is also dividends and buybacks where we are active on that front. We have an active dividend program in place we have been consistently paying out about a third of our free cash flow in earnings, we are increasing that dividend as pre cash flow and earnings increased. If they top it with the board every quarter on the level of that dividend, and right now, yes we have more flexibility with that cash position growing but right now we are staying with course on the dividend side and I'll tell you on the other side, its the same story where we have a researchers' plan in place. Its serving the purpose of offsetting a delusion from employee equity grants. We are staying on course right now with that dividend program we already have more flexibility. Its an ongoing target with the board meeting and staying on course for the time being with that researchers' plan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Hugh Miller: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I had a question or two on the high yield topic. Looks like from the data you presented us with that you guys saw a nice increase in high yield volumes quarter over quarter up, you know, maybe 4 or 5%. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how that trended to route the quarter as we look at some of the industry data. It looks like industry data started to soften a bit during the quarter. If you could give us some clarity there.
Tony DeLise: Yes, on the high yield side, it did taper off as you pointed out throughout the quarter. You know we look at some volatility specific. It looks like volatility has dipped down during the quarter. In fact, we're seeing in July, we are seeing high yield volume down high yield trade volume is down from the second quarter level. It's not down appreciably and it is up compared to July 2014. You know, so if we look at volatility there is an impact there but not an appreciable year over year change. At least, that's what we are seeing so far in July.
Hugh Miller: Okay and as we take a look at the kind of U.S. high grade fee capture, I know that you mentioned that the duration was down during the quarter and I guess its a period where we saw the yield curve steep in. Were you guys kind of surprised at how things traded, just given that typically, you would anticipate the steep yield curve will probably you know cause investors to go a bit longer than you to benefit there. And, you know, is there anything you're seeing right now with the duration that's solid in July?
Tony DeLise: You know, really nothing to speak of. There may have been a slight steep in of the yield curve. You know, that doesn't always have to serve its [indiscernible] immediately and directly in client trading behavior. That changed sequentially lately, the $8 per million change. It mentioned that it was a slight increase in yield and a slight decline in years to maturity. Those years to maturity is still within the post crisis range of bond to our traded platform. It was still close to 8 years and not a big change there.
Hugh Miller: Ok. And then, on the Euro bond activity, obviously you've seen a meaningful increase year over year in part because of some of the share gains you guys have enjoyed. Do you look like, you know, that it was down on a quarter over quarter basis where we were seeing a softening in activity for year gone for the industry. But, I was wondering, can you talk about what you're seeing at other competitors as you guys have made changes to the platform. You know, are you seeing reaction from your competitors and are you seeing, kind of, any differences in trading activity as a result of some of their changes?
Rick McVey: Not really. We're pleased with the results that we had in the second quarter there was a modest shift in the product mix traded by the European clients on the MarketAxess system. But the 44% volume gained year over year, it feels like a very good progress to us and the number of clients that are engaged in using the system each month and each quarter continues to grow. So, it really feels like we are on the right track. With respect to competition, we haven't seen anything terribly new from the incumbents they are forming new platforms in Europe as you are aware, just like we see in the US but we are not really aware that if those new platforms gaining any significant traction.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with CreditSuisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ashley Serrao: Good morning. Rick, I just want to get a sense if there is a noticeable difference in the geographic adoption of open trading. I mean looking at your European and US clients and also what is the pipeline of new liquidity providers look like?
Rick McVey: Sure, its hardly tell really because we are in a such early gates of open trading in Europe. We are seeing growing adoption from European client they trade US high grade highly over emerging markets products which was consistent with the pattern that we’ve seen in the US. With respect to Eurobond, its very early gate because we just really launched open trading about three months ago and more appliances are documenting with MarketAxess each week in order to be able to utilize those tools and the anecdotal feedback were getting is very positive because you probably say in the past that look [indiscernible] even more challenge in Europe then it in the US but it still difficult to make a comparisons directly given the early stages that we are in Europe. 
Ashley Serrao: Okay. Then on this stress test what do you think that they could potentially do to accelerate markets structure changes. What do you hearing from both clients directly this year?
Rick McVey: When you say clients actually give me an investor manager you’re talking about?
Ashley Serrao: Yes, Investor Managers.
Rick McVey: We’re hearing consistently from the large investors that they’re meeting more regularly with regulators. And to talk about liquidity stress testing within their portfolios and basically what the regulators are trying to better understand is whether investment manager have sufficient liquidity in their portfolios to meet various redemption scenarios. Our census this is very early stages by take it’s at a great sign of the regulators are spending so much sign in the industry participants to better understand those trends. And we see investor managers taking a variety of steps to be prepared for any redemption scenarios from adding liquidity to their portfolios to using electronic trading to our greater extend which is closely reflecting in our market share gains. There are sign that they are using ETFs more actively more actively as it liquidity to its portfolios setting up back stop lines so there are brightest stuff that we know investor managers are taking to make sure that they do have sufficient liquidity in their portfolios to meet potential redemptions. 
Ashley Serrao: Okay. And then on the increase in block trading, its picked up nicely over the past few quarters. Just wanted to get some cover and what’s driving the uptake and also whether you’re seeing any client to client blocks being transacted here means active here or its still mainly that deal is driving the bus?
Rick McVey: It’s a little bit above. We are seeing block trades crossing unnecessary client to client but capturing in open trading with non-traditional liquidity providers and we’re are seeing more electronic increase from investors and block trades sides that they are going to the deals. And quite also we consistently we see that the price responses or even better and in block trade increase and what we’ve seen in round like that odd lines. So, if we have suddenly and peer to ask that the liquidity advantage and that reduction and transaction process equally relevant for clients trading on blocks, blocks are market access. That it is for smaller trade sectors. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Adams of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mike Adams: Good morning, guys. Congrats for the strong Q2. Following up on the block question, what is the market share that you have right now of block size trades? And what is that trends looks like, if you give map force?
Rick McVey: Yeah, Mike. Right now on the block trading and this is where we defining it as over 5 million in trade size. Yes, its right around [indiscernible] standard. So, I think, I cost normally because we have just continuing reporting around that if you listen to way which condition remain 40 shares around 8%. That’s is, it is a growing consistent with the growth in market share across our other size but it which quick mention in the prepared remarks and buckets, which Rick mentioned in the prepared remarks. And I'm just opening up a sheet right now. If you look back over the past four years, block trading market share has more than doubled over the past four years. There's been a consistent growth in block trading. We're doing better there. We think we have protocols to address trading in larger trade sizes, you know, the bigger piece of what we're doing today.
Rick McVey: I mentioned in my prepared remarks Mike that block trade year-over-year, trade count was up about 35%, so we're gaining share at slightly faster pace in blocks than what you see overall in high grade.
Mike Adams: And then last one for me, just want to talk about some of the liquidity concerns in the market. There were some reports that back in June, FINRA had hosted a meeting with credit traders to discuss delays to TRACE trade reporting for block size trades. So I mean if you have any insight, do you mind commenting on the meeting and maybe the likelihood of such a delay being implemented? And then second, what would this mean for MarketAxess because I know you gus have talked about TRACE being helping grow your business?
Rick McVey: Sure. I think that it's the consistent theme whether you're talking to large dealers or large investor is that, they believe that some delay of reporting of the largest blocks would be helpful in secondary liquidity for large block trades. I have voiced support for that. If you look at trade sizes over $10 million in high grade corporate bonds, the transactions are only about 300 trades per day or about 1% of TRACE trade. And if it would help the market with secondary liquidity it has some delay to allow market participants to manage their risk on those very large trades. I think that would be a positive step for the industry. It doesn’t really sacrifice the positive steps that have been made in transparency in the U.S. markets by FINRA through TRACE because 99% of the trades would still presumably be reported in real-time. Quite honestly the theme was consistent as I mentioned between dealers and investors, but as you would expect the regulators have plenty of questions about how that would impact market knowledge of what's taking place through the day, volume and various securities, pricing in securities, end of day closing prices et cetera. So I don’t think that there'll be any quick changes on this but it is one of the topics being discussed in terms of how the regulators may be able to contribute to better secondary market liquidity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So this morning I saw a news article that said that Bondcube one of the start-up competitors in the space just shut down basically they weren’t getting any traction and then they weren’t getting enough funding to keep going. So that's just and I think it's consistent with your commentary that a lot of these new start-ups are really struggling to get traction, but just be curious that you take -- when you're having dialogues with your customers, what is their tone in terms of all these new competitors kind of knock on their doors and trying to get in there and try out their platforms?
Rick McVey: I think the institutional market is struggling with bandwidth. There are so many new entrants trying to get client adoption and just in the early stages of even signing up clients that I think both investors and dealers are struggling with the bandwidth to embrace many as any of the new platforms. And as I mentioned in the past it's not an easy decision. I think people have to assess the liquidity benefits of any platform, but then they have to work through legal agreements, they have to think about the clearing on the platform, they have to go through technology due diligence, they have to ultimately get either their trade capture system or their OMS connected to the platform. So this is not a quick decision and as a result those platforms that have no trading activity and limited connectivity today, I think are having the hardest time with that adoption given the number of new entrants in the market.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Next on Europe, so you guys have kind of been disruptive to the status quo in Europe and open up the platform to more than just three or four dealers and you obviously had a less success of that, how easy is it for your big competitors and by that I mean trade like Bloomberg, how easily can they replicate what you have done in terms of market structure because obviously they’ve seen your success and that's probably just the way the market is heading.
Rick McVey: I think it's difficult for us to comment on what their strategy might be. It’s from a technology standpoint it's relatively straight forward, should they choose to increase the number of dealers that investors can access on any electronic enquiry. The far more difficult piece in my opinion is moving towards open trading all to all which is something that we’ve been investing in for many years and continue to invest in heavily every quarter. So simply a change around the number of dealers is fairly straight forward but the next step is undoubtedly a bigger one.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So I guess recently there has been a pretty high profile debate about the impact of bond ETFs on market liquidity and what happens in a rising rate environment and I think [indiscernible] 0:39:26.8 made some really public statements about that last week. Do you kind of have take on that subject? Do you think that the growth of ETFs and fixed income has contributed to some liquidity issues that people are worried about?
Rick McVey: I actually think the growth in ETFs has been positive for market liquidity. It's a standardized form of being able to trade at basket or index of bonds can be traded either in shares or the APs and the dealer of the trading, the underlying assets; so we see it as a positive contributor. The ETF business continues to take inflows at a very healthy clip, so the assets are growing. And I think the only way that changes is if there is a material increase in interest rates or default rates that are far in excess of what we’ve observed over the last three or four years, neither one of the which seems all that likely in the near term. And we see open trading is a piece of the very positive evolution of ETF's secondary market liquidity. You see the APs active in our open order book every day. So they have more volumes and more trade opportunities to manage. There are business and provide liquidity that's critical to the functioning of the ETF market than they ever have before. So we see this is a real positive and it certainly is becoming a bigger and bigger part of what we see on the trading system and also in open trading.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then lastly from me, so you talk about how the sequential increase in other credit fee capture per million was function mix shift, but within the individual lines high-yield emerging markets and probably euro bonds, how has the pricing in from those products trended over the last year or so?
Rick McVey: Have to be -- the only, so that other credit category, it is depended on the mix shift within those three products. And you are right, there is some dynamic even among the products. And so the only one that has been noticeable has been in emerging markets where our volume is a combination of emerging markets sovereign bonds and emerging market corporate bonds, and what we’ve seen over the past year has been a shift towards sovereign bonds, so that having you waiting for sovereign bonds for us. That means that the fee capture is lower on sovereign bonds versus corporate bonds. So we have seen a decline in that particular part, we have seen a decline of somewhere around a 10% in the fee capture on that particular product. Again that's also to do with the mix within it not the retained pricing plan.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Michael Wong with Morningstar. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael Wong: Now that open trading has grown nicely do you have any revenue number to attach to all your open trading volume?
Rick McVey: We don't break it out specifically with open trading, but we’ve said in the past that the fee capture for open trading is similar to the fee capture for traditional clients as dealer trading and as I said this morning, it represents roughly 10% of our activity in the U.S. products currently.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay. And for open trading, how much trading would you say or trading volume that's now occurring on open trading is truly incremental to the platform versus if that change in execution did on your platform?
Rick McVey: I think it represents almost entirely incremental liquidity on the platform, which is one of the factors that I am convinced is driving our order flow and our market-share up and faster pace. These are non-traditional counterparties that are meeting in the open trading order book and when two parties can find a natural match in the open order book, it is driving really important transaction cost savings to both parties. So this is incremental liquidity, it's new counterparties, it's adding to the secondary market ecosystem. And the best news in my opinion is that we are still in very early inning. As I mentioned the participation rates are growing, but we still see about 30% of our traditional assets management clients that are actively participating in open trading, but most of the rest are telling us that they are doing the work so that in future quarters they too can take advantage of the trading opportunities within the open order book.
Operator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Ric McVey for any further remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you next question.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And u may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-22 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - IR Manager Rick McVey - Chairman, CEO Tony DeLise - CFO
Analysts: Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill Hugh Miller - Macquarie Niamh Alexander - KBW Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded April 22, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning. And welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. For the call are Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2015 results. This morning we reported a strong start to 2015 with record revenues of $77 million up 21%, record pre-tax income of $39 million up 39% and record diluted EPS of $0.65 up from $0.46 a year ago. Accelerating market share gains across high-grade, high-yield emerging market and euro bond products drove our record results. Our estimated adjusted U.S. high-grade market share was 15.6% for the quarter up from 13.4% a year ago. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in our European business with euro bond volumes up over a 100% and total trading volumes from clients in the region up 75% year-over-year. Our record quarter in open trading volumes and participation reflects the value that we are delivering to dealers and investors through our innovative, all-to-all, trading protocols. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Increased credit spread volatility drove robust secondary trading volumes in the first quarter. High-yield markets were particularly active sending high-yield TRACE volumes up 25% year-over-year. Combined high-grade and high-yield TRACE volume in the first quarter represents the best quarter ever for secondary volume since FINRA introduced TRACE in 2002. We are seeing a tailwind from secondary market volumes brought on by the large increase in corporate debt outstanding and the up tick in market volatility. Improved market volumes and accelerating share gains delivered the record high-grade and high-yield trading volumes on MarketAxess despite heavy U.S. high-grade new issuance in the first quarter. Taxable bond funds experienced net inflows during the quarter while interest rates remained low. Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Strong momentum continues in open trading with another record quarter for volumes and participation. Our average daily volume for Q1 was $300 million up 187% compared to the first quarter of 2014. This represented a total of $18 billion traded during the quarter. Over 35,000 open trading transactions were completed compared to 11,800 in the year ago quarter and over 9% of our U.S. trade now take place using open trading protocols. We believe that one of the key benefits of open trading comes from the diversity of liquidity provision. During the quarter, 346 different firms responded to open trading increase up from 172 in the first quarter of 2014. Approximately 42% have completed open trading transactions were won by traditional asset managers, 39% by dealers and about 19% by alternative liquidity providers such as hedge funds and ETF market markers. We are seeing open trading adoption across a range of products with 62% of our trades in U.S. high-grade, 26% in high-yield and 12% in other products. And we continue to enhance our open trading platform. Most recently we added anonymous work out functionality to our client access protocol to support trading in larger sizes. This new source of all-to-all liquidity is creating efficiencies that deliver real cost savings to our global clients. During the first quarter, we estimated our client saved on average of 3 basis points in yield in transaction cost savings for the open trades that were completed. In dollar terms based on the average maturity of bonds traded on MarketAxess, we estimate client saved on average $1800 per million traded for a high-grade bond and $3400 for a million traded for a high-yield bonds. The MarketAxess liquidity pool continues to get more diverse and valuable for both our dealer and investor clients. Slide 6 provides an update on Europe. We are seeing the results of our strategic investments in Europe through the continued growth of our business in the region, the enhancements to our trading platform and introduction of unique and valuable data tools have been well-received with trading volumes from European clients up 75% year-over-year. We added four new dealers to the platform during the first quarter further broadening our European liquidity pool. This followed the launch in January of open trading per European products. Although it is early days, we are already seeing 24% of euro bond increase being sent to the Market Lists open order book. In February, we launched Axess All, the first intra-day trade tape for European fixed income markets. And last night, we announced the launch of a MarketAxess composite price that provides market participants with greater pre-trade visibility into euro bond pricing. Both of these new data products demonstrate our continued commitment to credit market transparency. This quarter, we also completed our build out of the Trax technology representing an important milestone in the integration of the two businesses. These developments are driving the growing revenue and earnings contribution from the European region. Now, I would like to hand the call over to Tony for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 7 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were up 30% year-over-year to $244 billion. U.S. high-grade volumes were a record $145 billion for the quarter up 22% from the first quarter of 2014. The majority of the high-grade volume gain was attributable to the 220 basis point increase in estimated market share. Estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE volume was up approximately 5% year-over-year. Volumes in the other credit category were up 63% compared to the first quarter of 2014 driven by an over 70% increase in order flow. We reported a record trading volumes for high-yield and emerging market bonds and more than doubling in euro bond trading volume. Trax and TRACE data indicate that overall emerging markets and euro bond market volumes were roughly flat and high-yield market volume was up approximately 25% year-over-year. This means that the vast majority of volume growth in our other credit category resulted from market share gains. In CDS, average daily trading volume during the first quarter was $1.8 billion or 54% above the fourth quarter 2014 run rate although short-term revenue opportunities remain modest. Slide 8 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $76.8 million were up 21% from a year ago driven by the record trading volume and commission revenue. The stronger dollar dampened the revenue growth by approximately $900,000. Information in post-trade service revenue, the majority of which is derived from our Trax business was flat year-over-year in local currency. We expect modest sequential growth information in post-trade services revenue as we introduce additional data products and increase trade matching rates. Technology product and services revenue was down to 30%, but the result was consistent with the revenue expectation comments made on our year-end earnings call. Total expenses were $38.3 million up 7% from the first quarter of 2014, absent the impact of a stronger dollar; the expense increase was approximately 10% year-over-year. Operating margin expanded more than 600 basis points year-over-year and ticked above 50% in the first quarter. The effective tax rate was 36.1% for the first quarter although the full year 2014 rate of 36.9%. While there are a number of variables in play, the full year 2015 effective tax rate is currently projected at the low-end of the guidance range of 36% to 38%. Our diluted EPS was a record $0.65 on a diluted share count of 37.6 million shares. The year-over-year decline in our diluted count was principally due to share repurchases. On Slide 9, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 43% year-over-year mainly due to the 30% increase in trading volume and higher overall fee capture. An increase in trading volumes and execution fees from our all variable fee plan accounted for the sequential change in U.S. high-grade fees per million. The sequential and year-over-year decline in the other credit category fees per million was due to a mixed shift within this category with heavy weighting to euro bond volume and sovereign emerging market bonds. The $600,000 sequential drop in distribution fees was mostly due to a decline in unused minimum commitment fees under our all variable U.S. high-grade fee plan. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. On a sequential basis, all of the non-compensation expense categories were inline with the fourth quarter figures. The sequential increase in compensation and benefits was largely attributable to a higher variable bonus accrual which is tied directly to operating performance and seasonally higher employment taxes and benefits. On a year-over-year basis, the 14% growth in compensation and benefits was due to a combination of higher variable bonus accrual, wages and equity based compensation. The year-over-year change in non-compensation costs was consistent with variations over the past several quarters. Depreciation and amortization increase as a result of a significant investment in product enhancements and technology over the past several years and professional and consulting fee to client. We still expect full year 2015 expenses will be within our expense guidance range. On Slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available for sale as of March 31st were $223 million compared to $234 million at year-end 2014. During the first quarter, we paid out our year-end employee cash bonuses of roughly $23 million, the quarterly cash dividend of $7.5 million and capital expenditures of $3.5 million. During the first quarter, we repurchased 117,000 shares at a cost of $8.9 million under our share buyback program. As of March 31, approximately $53 million was available for future repurchases under the program. Based on the first quarter results, our Board approved a $0.20 regular quarterly dividend. There was no change in our capital structure during the first quarter, we have no bank debt outstanding and didn't borrow against our revolving credit facility. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks Tony. The first quarter represents a great start to the New Year. The increase in market volumes reflects a small increase in market volatility and a large increase in outstanding corporate bond debt. For the second quarter in a row, we have seen an acceleration of market share gains across all of our core products. Open trading is already delivering meaningful new liquidity and transaction cost savings to our clients. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Adams of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Mike Adams: Good morning guys. I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but congrats on the record results here.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Mike.
Tony DeLise: Thanks Mike.
Mike Adams: So first, the detail that you guys provided last night in the open trading was really helpful. So couple of questions on that subject, first, could you try to explain why high-yield customer seem to be more rapidly adopting the open trading 14% of high-yield volume compared to 8% in IG. Given if there is less electronic penetration in high-yield, I guess I find that surprising. And then the second part of it, can you remind us what the transaction cost savings are for customers in the traditional disclosed RFQ trade. I would like to see how that compares to the 3 basis points that you updated us on for the open trading?
Rick McVey: Sure. On the first question, the liquidity challenges in high-yield over the last few quarters have been more significant than high-grade. And Mike I'm sure you are aware that is primarily due to the volatility in the high-yield market caused by the significant move in many of the energy issuers. And as a result, I think the attraction on the draw to open trading was greater over the last few quarters. The other thing we noticed in our high-yield business, which we have mentioned in the past is that we do see a significant percentage of high-yield trading on MarketAxess being conducted with the ETF community. And that percentage is higher in high-yield than it is in high-grade and that community is also drawn to the open trading order book. So I think for both of those reasons, the percentage of trades in our high-yield business is conducted with open trading protocols is higher than the percentage of trades conducted in high-grade. What we are doing with the cost savings is we are looking at the execution price achieved when a trade has won through the open trading protocols and comparing that to the best level available from a traditional liquidity provider. And that leads to the cost saving numbers that we provided both in the release last night and on the call this morning. I need to refresh the data on cost savings when we were looking at the cover of the price improvement from traditional liquidity providers prior to the launch of open trading. But my recollection is that was around 2 basis points, this is another 3 basis points beyond the best traditional level achieved on the platform.
Mike Adams: Interesting, interesting. Thank you. And then I would like to touch on European operation. So you mentioned some of the product enhancements this quarter and then even some last night, have you see any share pick up since the upgrades whether you are actually taking share from other electronic platforms over the overall market it is – is there anyway you can quantify that for us?
TonyDeLise: Mike, its Tony. In the prepared remarks I mentioned that based on the Trax information, we think that euro bond volume is roughly flat and they actually be down year-over-year. So when you see for example we posted for euro bond volume 126% increase in volume year-over-year, we think that virtually all of that is from market share gains. And because the information isn't perfect, we think that we are sort of mid to high single-digit in market share, but that would be double where it was last year.
Mike Adams: Okay. And I appreciate there is not a lot of transparency today, but did you think you are taking it from other electronic platforms or is this or you taking it from the void?
RickMcVey: It's hard to know. But, the electronic market in Europe has been growing overall, and it would be our guess that we have taken some share from the other electronic providers in Europe, having said that, we can do much better in the region. We haven't performed up to our expectations historically in Europe and all the metrics that we can see through Trax trade reporting suggest that Europe needs new sources of liquidity even more so than the U.S. credit markets because transaction cost in the European region are higher than they are in the U.S. and turnover is lower. So we are really excited about the launch of open trading and the extension of our alliance with Black Rock for open trading into Europe. And the addition of some really valuable data products to provide greater transparency in the region because we really think that we can provide more value and clients in the region do a much better job for our shareholders.
Mike Adams: Okay. And then one other follow up on Europe, do you have any near-term plans to explicitly charge for the Axess All product because I believe you are not charging for that today, you are sort of seeing it from increased trading activity?
Rick McVey: It's a brand new product. So the first step is to get broad market exposure and understanding for the Axess All product and why it's different than all of the other source of data that institutional investors or dealers are used to using in the region. We will charge for those services in coming quarters we don't know exactly what the take up will be but the first step is to make sure its broadly available to people and they understand the data products over the next several months we will revisit the charging structure. We have had a number of large dealers in particular saying that they would like to receive that data through intra-daying FTP files and we have that underway this quarter. So as Tony mentioned in prepared remarks we are optimistic that we will see a modest improvement in data revenues throughout the course of the year and beyond.
Mike Adams: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen, and congrats again.
Rick McVey: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller of Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Hugh Miller: Hey. Good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Hugh.
Tony DeLise: Welcome back, Hugh.
Hugh Miller: Thank you. I guess wanted to start-off with one housekeeping question and you gave us some color on the FX impact on the revenue side in the press release. And I know you made some comments on the call, but I was wondering if you could just – do remind us what the impact was on the expense side in the quarter.
Tony DeLise: Hugh, it was – I mentioned that on the revenue side, it was about $900,000. And today when we look at our – it's really our sterling denominated revenue and expenses. They are pretty similar. So the expense impact was also approximately $900,000. You look at that the dollar strengthening, and just to put it in perspective, if the dollar went from one spot six to one spot five, which is basically what we saw over the course of the year. For us, on an annual basis that $2.5 million or $3 million impact on both revenue and expenses that leads the way our sterling denominated business is situated right now.
Hugh Miller: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And transitioning to some other follow-up questions on Europe, obviously, you guys are seeing substantial progress there. Was wondering you commented about obviously driven by market share and some of which being taken from maybe the other providers there from the electronic sources. We have seen some of those competitors that can be fairly, I guess competitive from a pricing perspective in some of their other product offerings. What do you guy see as the potential for risk there for them to try and defend market share by competing on price. I know that you guys are providing some services that they don't offer that are in-demand. But, can you give us your thoughts on that.
Rick McVey: Yes. There is consistency in the pricing model for the leading – the current leader in Europe electronic fixed income trading. And then it's a bundle pricing model. So their fee structure is all based on the price of the terminal whether you look at the swap markets or the bond markets, they do not typically charge exclusively for transaction. So that is there pricing model, which means that in order for us to compete Hugh effectively, we have to differentiate our liquidity pool and the quality of the transaction prices on MarketAxess. And that is why the journey that we are on now to provide investors and dealers with more choice and more outlets to liquidity is so important to our success in Europe because what we have seen in the U.S. is that by differentiating liquidity pool, the transaction cost savings that we can deliver to clients are exponentially greater than the transaction fees that we build into transactions. So it's really important that we continue to prove that we can deliver a better price of execution given the state of the pricing model with the market incumbent in Europe.
Hugh Miller: It was very helpful. Thank you. And I guess just looking at the domestic market here and looking at some trends for April, it looks like industry ADV a bit slower on a year-over-year comparison. I was wondering if you could just provide us with some insight as to what you are seeing so far in April and thoughts on market share performance for U.S. high-grade.
Tony DeLise: What you are seeing is consistent with what we are seeing in, when you look at high-grade volume right now, it is also the first quarter run rate for TRACE, what we are seeing is, it's down to 16% or 17% or 18% versus the first quarter. High-yield is off as well, it looks like it's off 6% or 7%. So that the ADV – the ADVs are down. It's a little early right now in the quarter. We still have or in the month – we still have seven trading days left in April here. And we don't see any thing surprising in share or in trading volume, but a little earlier you started talking about that market share number more discretely there.
Hugh Miller: That's helpful. And as I look at kind of you guys have always been opportunistic on a share buyback and you try to mitigate the impact of share or dilution from share grants. Obviously, we have been seeing the stock that's doing quite well and appreciating faster than kind of with the earnings of the company which has obviously been strong as well. But, I was wondering can you give us a sense of your appetite for share repurchase as you look at things now. And should we be considering the potential to see maybe some more creep than we have seen in years past just thoughts on that would be helpful?
TonyDeLise: Consistent with what we have – how we acted on the past we are more aggressive when we think we trading at a discounted fair value or discounted to DSF. Otherwise, we have been using the program; you have seen at the past several quarters we are using the program to offset solutions from the equity grants. And you just put it into perspective on those equity grants we have been averaging somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 shares per year in those equity grants. The 10b5 one grid that we set up, we typically act in these share repurchases under on an organized 10b5 one plan. It is price sensitive and that price sensitivity means the lower the share price, the more shares we are repurchasing and then it works in the inverse, the higher the share price, the fewer shares that we are repurchasing. We are pretty close to hitting our target diluted share count. And what that tells you is that what we will be doing here is really continuing to offset dilution from our equity grants. And that's what you saw in the first quarter.
Hugh Miller: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much for all the insight.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander of KBW. Your line is now open.
Niamh Alexander: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats from me too.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Niamh.
Niamh Alexander: Good morning. And back to the market share and the momentum, such a strong start to the year and we didn't even see nearly as much of a dip in the market share if at all that we would see seasonally. And you talked about accelerating momentum as well and I know it's too early to kind of talk about April. But, what do you think is driving this, the train has left the station on adopting the electronic trading as people kind of giving up maybe trying some of these new venues that aren't – somewhat weakened euro is not having much success. And how do you feel about the momentum from here?
Rick McVey: Yes. I think its 2 or 3 different things Niamh over the last two quarters, really one is market volatility is up. So there has been more emphasis and focus on secondary trading. So that is always a good environment for us. The first two or three quarters of last year, we were dealing with very low volatility lots of inflows and focused on the new issue calendar that reversed in Q4 and Q1 and that's always a healthy thing for us and our share. Secondly, I think the recognition is growing that market structure is changing in credit. That bank owned dealers do have more constraints on market making because of the regulatory changes that have taken place and each quarter especially when volatility picks up institutional investors feel those changes. And as a result, I think it's causing a behavioral shift where they are inclined to trade more electronically and explore new sources of liquidity. The third factor that I would suggest is that the success that we are having in open trading is adding more appeal and value to the MarketAxess system. It's increasing the value of the platform to existing clients and it's creating additional opportunities for new clients. So we see both share growing with our existing clients and a number of participants that are active on the platform growing sequentially. So all of those things I think have contributed to the acceleration of share gains that we are really seeing across all of our core products over the last several quarters.
Niamh Alexander: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks Rick. I guess back to the first one, the market environment and the volatility picking up, as we get maybe towards rates rising later in the U.S. and who knows when it happens. But, a rising rate environment it might impact the fees, I think only in the investment grade complex not the other credit complex that's right. But, shouldn't that be a better environment for MarketAxess as well.
TonyDeLise: Niamh, you are right on the impact on the fee plans. That's where – it's really sort of isolated to the high-grade complex where that rate movement impacts the fee capture. And you are also right that all things being equal, if we had that rising rate environment you could see some change and a decline in a fee capture. You are also right that what we may see in this rising rate environment is, if there is a pick up in volatility and recollect some of the comments that Rick made, some of the pick up in volatility, we think that's good for market volume; we think that's good for our share. And while it seems to be pushed off, it seems like with Fed and the others just thinking as the rate movement has been pushed back to later this year. We are – if we do happen to hit that rising rate environment it comes with the increased volatility, we are looking forward to it.
Niamh Alexander: Okay. Fair enough. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly you had other questions on the dividend and the buyback, but you are growing the cash nicely here. And make sure that we are still kind of focused on, is it the best opportunity, you are primarily organic growth initiatives and your investments is primarily focused on organic right now so probably likely to continue to build cash all else equal?
Tony DeLise: Niamh, what you see from us when look at the opportunity we have in front of us with the core product set. That's the focus today. And you look at the key initiatives which have been pretty consistent over the past several years and that's round to open trading and the investments that we have made in Europe, the returns there are just difficult to match otherwise.
Niamh Alexander: Yes. Yes. Fair enough.
Tony DeLise: That is where the focus is right now.
Niamh Alexander: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Q - Patrick O: Hey, good morning, guys.
Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning, guys.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Patrick.
Q - Patrick O: Curious about reverse to Yankees, so obviously a lot of U.S. companies have started to issue bonds over in Europe because of lower rate environment over there. Is that a positive catalysts for you guys, I'm thinking kind of from perspective of – you have a lot of U.S. firms that are used to trading these companies dead over in the U.S. and now they want to trade over in Europe. Is that kind of a source of your market share pick-up in Europe, right now?
Shaughnessy: Curious about reverse to Yankees, so obviously a lot of U.S. companies have started to issue bonds over in Europe because of lower rate environment over there. Is that a positive catalysts for you guys, I'm thinking kind of from perspective of – you have a lot of U.S. firms that are used to trading these companies dead over in the U.S. and now they want to trade over in Europe. Is that kind of a source of your market share pick-up in Europe, right now?
Rick McVey: I don't really think so. I think that the protocol changes that we have made in Europe and the addition of new and valuable data products are really driving the share gains there. You are right with the rapid drop in the rate environment in Europe there has been some trend back toward greater growth in issuance in Europe, having said that, the U.S. high-grade market just finished a record quarter in issuance here. So the issuance environment has been healthy in both regions and part of that driven by what has been a very active M&A calendar to kick-off 2015 which often comes with [indiscernible].
Q - Patrick O: Got it. Thanks. And then I guess to follow up on Europe since the topic, does your -- so you talked about how obviously your biggest competitor for electronic trading over there has basically a free model. But, is there opportunity for you guys to raise your pricing there over time because European pricing is less than half of what your U.S. variable pricing looks like. You are providing that value for your customers, does your long-term plan kind of assume any sort of upside from pricing in Europe?
Shaughnessy: Got it. Thanks. And then I guess to follow up on Europe since the topic, does your -- so you talked about how obviously your biggest competitor for electronic trading over there has basically a free model. But, is there opportunity for you guys to raise your pricing there over time because European pricing is less than half of what your U.S. variable pricing looks like. You are providing that value for your customers, does your long-term plan kind of assume any sort of upside from pricing in Europe?
Rick McVey: To be determined, I can tell you that it's not in the scope of plans in the near term or really focusing on driving more value to our European and dealer investor clients through differentiating transaction costs on the system and our data products. Longer term we will always revisit all of our fee plans to make sure that they are competitive in the marketplace and best suited for market share gains and returns to our shareholders. But we would anticipate any changes in any of our pricing models in the near term.
Q - Patrick O: Got it. And the last one for me, it seems like we are seeing headlines from different regulators that really talking about the stability of the fixed income market including corporate bonds. How much of this is just kind of noise at this point and how much are there actual kind of actionable constructive suggestions by the regulators at this point?
Shaughnessy: Got it. And the last one for me, it seems like we are seeing headlines from different regulators that really talking about the stability of the fixed income market including corporate bonds. How much of this is just kind of noise at this point and how much are there actual kind of actionable constructive suggestions by the regulators at this point?
Rick McVey: I think there is a lot of healthy dialog going on and what we like is they are reaching out to industry participants to conduct their research and better understand the challenges in the credit market. But it was interesting just yesterday Commissioner Piwowar had a speech and was saying; he is very encouraged by all the innovation that he sees in the electronic trading space. He wants to make sure that regulations don't get in the way of that innovation. So we are pleased to see that and as I mentioned in prior calls, the first focus that we are seeing from the SEC and FINRA on the corporate bond market seems to be directed primarily at the retail market. But they are conducting lots of research and talking to industry participants and with the SEC in particular we like to thank that they got a very constructive approach with the industry and trying to find ways that they maybe helpful.
Q - Patrick O: Got it. Thank you.
Shaughnessy: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Ashley Serrao: Good morning, guys.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Ashley.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Ashley.
Ashley Serrao: Rick as you think about the European opportunity irrespective of liquidity pool, can you provide just comparing contrast number of dealers you have in the U.S. versus Europe. I'm just trying to get a sense of how many more dealers you could add to diversify the pool there?
Rick McVey: Sure. We have been adding dealers as we mentioned earlier and the reason its now easier to add dealers is do dealers can have access to more order flow because of the increase in investor choice that we have provided recently with our European protocols. The total population Ashley that we see today is not as great as the U.S., if we are 80 or so in the U.S., we don't see it growing to that number. But there certainly are still 10 or 15 opportunities to add traditional dealer market makers to our European platform and that we are working on that. The other thing that I will add is that because of open client choice and trade increase and open trading, we have enabled new dealers to participate in the credit markets in the U.S. and many of them have become very active participants on MarketAxess. So just by opening the architecture in Europe, we would expect it to attract new capital and new dealers in much the same way it did in the U.S. over the last five years or so.
Ashley Serrao: Okay. That makes sense. Maybe that just gives you open trading, just what are your thoughts around just average trade size as this initiative gains more traction, do you expect to built from here.
Rick McVey: We are certainly investing very heavily in protocols that will help our clients with larger trade sizes conducted electronically. And it's no surprise that the average trade size currently is similar to what it was in our previous protocols because most of what is being used today is a natural extension of our RFQ business where investors are sending orders to their dealer counterpart at the same time that they are posting the orders in Market Lists. But we are seeing over the last two or three months more take-up in client access which is a more passive form posting orders and identifying matches and just recently we added the work up capabilities once that matches has been identified. That work up we think comes with very clever tools to eliminate information leakage. So we match the lowest common denominator between the two parties and don't disclose what else might have been available. And that's the beginning we think focusing more on protocols that are designed around the larger trade sizes. This will be the evolution. It's a – we are very pleased with the success that we have had but we have five protocols out today. And most of our trading is using one of those protocols. We will enhance what we already have out and we will continue to add new protocols and we are speaking to dealer investor clients' everyday to get their input and we think over the next year or two you will see more innovation from us in some of those specifically designed at large trade sizes.
Ashley Serrao: Okay. And just final question for Tony, can you just remind us what the average pricing of the three products in other credit bucket currently stand at?
Tony DeLise: Ashley the pricing does work differently for each of those products for euro bonds, emerging markets and high-yield. And even within euro bonds for example we have several key plans working there much like we do in the U.S. where we have one plan that is a combination of distribution fees and variable fees; we have another plan which is all variable. In between emerging markets there is different pricing for corporate and severance for high-yield bonds, the pricing looks different for bonds that trade on price versus bonds that trade on spread. I'm not going to provide all of the granular details there, I will tell you that as expected given the bid offer on high-yield for example, the higher fee capture in that product category comes from high-yield. And then at the office end of the spectrum in that group would be euro bond. Across that spectrum it probably runs from a $100 at the low end to something closer to $600 per million at the high end.
Ashley Serrao: Just a very helpful color from both of you. Thanks for taking my questions.
Rick McVey: Thanks Ashley.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Mike Adams of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.
Mike Adams: Hey, guys. Just a couple of follow ups from me. First to build up Ashley's question, would you mind commenting on the mix of the other credit volume in April, I know it's only a few weeks here. But, I'm curious to have the euro bond momentum continue to sort of increase in terms of the overall mix.
Tony DeLise: Mike, again, it's a little bit early on this what I mentioned before is that there is really nothing we are seeing in April that stay consistent with the first quarter.
Mike Adams: Okay. And then Tony one other one for you, in regards to the distribution piece, you talked about a decline in unused commitment fees in the first quarter which I guess makes sense given how active the trading was on the platform. Were there any unused commitment fees recognized in 1Q, just trying to figure out, could there be another step down?
Tony DeLise: It's a good question Mike and just as a reminder, under our all variable plan, the dealers are paying a variable fee and then there is this execution fee which is subject to a minimum commitment. And we do have a level and it was around $750,000 of unused commitment fee. The better news would be if that unused commitment fees were zero. That means that all of our dealers on that particular plan are active in trading and it could swing there is, it's tough to predict what will happen going forward on the distribution fees and on these unused minimum commitments. There could be some movement going forward, if there is movement on that in our – you see the all variable client dealers like what you saw on the first quarter, if you see them winning a larger percentage of our trade. There could be a decline in distribution fees but that would largely be offset by an increase in variable transaction fees. So it's a bit neutral to overall, but it would impact the individual categories.
Mike Adams: Sure. Great. Thank you, Tony.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the call back over to Mr. Rick McVey for any closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This will conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-01-28 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - IR Manager Rick McVey - Chairman & CEO Tony DeLise - CFO
Analysts: Niamh Alexander - KBW Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Michael Wong - Morningstar
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 28, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning. And welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. This morning we reported record revenues, pre-tax income, and diluted EPS for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter revenues were $70 million, up 16% from the previous year, pre-tax income was $34 million, up 35%, and diluted EPS was $0.57 compared to $0.41 for the prior year quarter. Q4 expenses were up just 3% to $37 million. Our record results were driven by a combination of increased market volumes and higher market share that led to record U.S. high grade, high-yield, and total trading volumes. Our estimated adjusted high grade market share was a record 16.1% in the fourth quarter up from 13.9% a year ago. In Europe we saw continued momentum in Eurobond volumes, as well as record trading volumes form European clients, which were up 73% year-over-year. Slide 4, highlights our full year results and continued strong growth rates. We continue to deliver solid year-over-year growth in trading volumes, transaction revenue, total revenue, and EPS. During the fourth quarter we saw an acceleration in our growth rates as the market environment improved for secondary trading. Growth was driven by strong market share gains across our core products with high grade estimated share of 0.7% year-over-year. 2014 share gains were concentrated in trade sizes over $1 million and the average trade size on the platform increased. We had another big jump in buy-side participation and cross-selling during 2014. There were 900 institutional clients active on the platform during 2014, up 8% versus 2013. Almost 700 of those institutions now trade at least two products on their platform and over 500 trade three or more products. Our free cash flow for the year was $95 million and in light of our strong results, our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share. Slide 5, provides an update on market conditions. Secondary credit trading conditions shifted during the fourth quarter due to an increase in credit spread volatility, mutual fund outflows, and rising credit spreads. This shift leads to a 9% year-over-year increase in TRACE volumes and increased demand for electronic trading. Corporate debt outstanding increased further during the year fueling demand for new trading solutions to facilitate the transfer of risk in the expanding credit markets. We were specifically gratified that our record results in the fourth quarter came during a period of active new issuance, up 22% from the prior year quarter. For the full year of 2014, secondary trading volumes across most fixed-income product areas were weaker due to the low interest rate environment and benign volatility. According to SIPA, total fixed-income secondary volume was down approximately 11% year-over-year with lower volumes in U.S. treasury, mortgage-backed, and municipal bonds, and slighter higher volumes in corporate bonds. Slide 6, provides an update on Open Trading. We are seeing continued acceleration of adoption rates for Open Trading by both dealers and investors. Approximately 7% of U.S. high grade trades on MarketAxess now take place using Open Trading protocols up from about 2% at the start of last year. During 2014, approximately 77,000 Open Trading transactions were completed representing over $38 billion in trading volume. All-to-all increased via market list received over 100,000 additional price responses last year over and above those received through the traditional RFQ. This represents the beginnings of a new base of liquidity to address the secondary market challenges in a much larger global credit market. Over 300 different investor and dealer firms actively responded to market list orders in the fourth quarter alone and over 450 firms benefitted from the additional liquidity on our Open Trading platform during the year. The pie-chart on page 6 demonstrates that Open Trading on MarketAxess is a true of all marketplace with dealers, investors, and alternative market participants all trading in the same liquidity pool. In 2015, we will continue to rollout additional Open Trading protocols to address larger trade sizes and less liquid volumes. We will also continue to deepen our technology integration with dealer and investor clients to improve the efficiency in identifying and completing Open Trading opportunities. Slide 7, provides an update on Europe. During the fourth quarter we experienced increased momentum with volume up 73% from European clients. Over 80% of client firms that now trade Eurobonds also trade U.S. credit products on MarketAxess. Consistent with our expectations, Trax became accretive to earnings in the second half of the year. Trade matching rates were up and we continue to see demand for an expanded set of post-trade services in light of recent European MiFID II regulatory proposals. Our dealer business revenues are growing, driven by an expanded set of valuable real time and historical data products to improve transparency and help our clients manage risk. Last week, we also announced the expansion of our strategic alliance with BlackRock into Europe, building on the success of the originally U.S. alliance announced in 2013. The announcement coincided with the launch of Open Trading for European credit products. We believe that offering increased choice and execution options and access to a broader range of trading counterparties will improve liquidity and reduce transaction costs for European fixed-income market participants. Now, I would like to hand the call over to Tony, for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were up 23% year-over-year to $211 billion. U.S. high grades volumes were a record $130 billion for the quarter, up 22% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The majority of the high grade volume gain was attributable to the 220 basis point increase in estimated market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by a 75% increase in investor order flow. We experienced significant gains across all other credit product categories, led by record high-yield trading volume and to more than 90% increase in Eurobond trading volume. The product mix within the other credit category was similar to the third quarter. In CDS, average daily trading volume during the fourth quarter was almost $1.2 billion 70% above the Q3 run rate although short-term revenue opportunities remain modest. With three trading days remaining in January average daily trading volume and average daily commission revenue are tracking consistent with the fourth quarter. Month-to-date high grade results in January are displaying the typical seasonal pattern with market share below the fourth quarter level but above January 2014. High-yield market share is tracking similar to the fourth quarter level. Slide 9, displays our quarter earnings performance. Revenues of $70 million were up 16% from a year ago, driven by the record trading volume and commission revenue. Trax revenue was up 10% in local currency year-over-year due to growth in data revenue. The fourth quarter technology products and services revenue is more representative of the near-term run rate. Total expenses were $36.7 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The modest increase in expenses, coupled with a double-digit revenue growth, led to an expansion of operating margin to 48%, and EBITDA to almost $38 million. The effective tax rate was 35.4% for the fourth quarter and 36.9% for full year 2014. The fourth quarter effective tax rate reflects the recognition of certain tax credits which were extended and enacted into law in December 2014 amounting to approximately $400,000. Our diluted EPS was a record $0.57 on a diluted share count of 37.7 million shares. The sequential decline and year-over-year decline in our diluted count was principally due to share repurchases. On Slide 10, we've laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes, and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 28% year-over-year mainly due to the 23% increase in trading volumes and favorable product mix. U.S. high grade fees per million of $178 were very similar to the third quarter and down slightly from the prior year. The year-over-year decline in high grade fees per million was due to a shift to larger trade sizes. Fees per million in the other credit category was $315, again very similar to the third quarter and down slightly from the year ago level. The year-over-year decline in fee capture was due to a mix shift within this category with a heavier weighting to Eurobond volume. There were no dealer fee plan migrations during the fourth quarter and distribution fees were in line with the third quarter level. We expect first quarter 2015 total distribution fees will be similar to the fourth quarter level. Slide 11, provides you with the expense detail. Fourth quarter 2014 expenses were up 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. On a sequential basis all of the expense categories were in line with the third quarter figures, with the exception of compensation and benefits which increased approximately $800,000. This entire increase was attributable to higher variable bonus accrual, which is tied directly to operating performance. The year-over-year increase in compensation and benefits was largely due to a higher variable bonus accrual and higher wages. Employee headcount was 303 at December month end, up from 293 one year ago. The year-over-year change in non-compensation cost was consistent with variations over the past several quarters. Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the significant investment in product enhancements and technology over the past several years, and professional and consulting fees declined reflecting lower technology consulting spend and lower legal fees. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available for sale as of December 31, were $234 million compared to $200 million at year-end 2013. Record free cash flow generation of $95 million was more than sufficient to cover the $62 million in dividends and share repurchases and almost $15 million in capital expenditures. There was no change in our capital structure during the fourth quarter. We have no bank debt outstanding and didn't borrow against our revolving credit facility. On Slide 13, we summarize our capital management activities. Our recurring quarterly dividend remains an active part of our capital management priorities. We have now increased the dividend in five consecutive years. We've also significantly increased our capital expenditures over the past five years. The annual spend surrounding software enhancements to our trading platform and protocols and other organic initiatives have increased five folds since 2010. We expect these investments to help drive future revenue growth. During the fourth quarter we repurchased 192,000 shares at a cost of $12.5 million under our share buyback program. As of December 31, approximately $62 million was available for future repurchases under the program. We remain focused on capital management and investment in organic initiatives. Through our existing cash position, strong cash flow generation, and line of credit borrowing capacity, we have the flexibility to meet our capital management and investment priorities. On Slide 14, we have laid out our 2015 expense, capital expenditure, and income tax rate guidance. We expect that total 2015 expenses will be in the range of $153 million to $159 million. The midpoint in that range suggests an approximately 8% year-over-year increase in expenses which would be below our five-year compound annual growth rate. Consistent with 2014, employee compensation and benefits costs are expected to represent a little over 50% of total expenses in 2015. We are targeting headcount to increase somewhere between 5% and 7% over the course of 2015 with most of the increase occurring during the first half of the year. We expect that 2015 capital expenditures will be similar to the 2014 level and will range from $14 million to $17 million. We will continue to invest in trading platform enhancements and expect around two-thirds of the spend to be in the form of software development. We expect to see effective tax rate for full year 2015 will be in the range of 36% to 38%. The mix of U.S. and foreign source income could cause variations in the effective tax rate. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick, for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Tony. 2014 was a solid year of revenue and earnings growth for MarketAxess in spite of benign secondary trading conditions for much of the year. Our competitive position continues to get stronger in our core high grade, high-yield, and EM products. Open Trading is leading the way with innovative liquidity solutions to restore credit market liquidity. In Europe growth in trading volumes and the integration of Trax provide the foundation for improved earnings from the region. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW. Your line is now open.
Niamh Alexander: Hi good morning and congratulations for the strong finish to the year.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Niamh.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Niamh.
Niamh Alexander: Good morning. I think you had given us color already on the market share, Tony. So thank you for that. You are kind of saying pretty seasonal but above 1Q which is kind of what we would have expected which is great. Can you talk to me maybe about the competitive market environment? I know we touch on it every quarter but there has been quite of few announcing they are getting in and some of the existing competitors have been re-upping their existing offering. Have you seen any change, heard any change from your competitors? Apart from the competitive environment, we are hearing a little bit more about for example the regulators wanting to take a look at bond trading not specifically corporate bond trading but bond trading generally. It seems it is more in the retail space but is it something that we should be watching in the institutional space that you are involved in as well? Thanks.
Tony DeLise: Sure, happy to take that Niamh, first on competition you're absolutely right lots of announcements again during 2014 of new initiatives both with existing market participants and new market participants. As I've said before it doesn't come as any surprise to us and we've always welcome competition in this space. We think it keeps us moving and investing which is exactly what we should be doing. There was no change really in the results from what we could tell in the fourth quarter with respect to volume or revenue development elsewhere. And clearly its very gratifying to see that we set new records for both share and volume during the fourth quarter at a time where there have been more competitors entering the space. So we don't think there has been any change there but clearly we need to keep investing and keep moving and developing new solutions for our clients. On the regulatory front, I would agree with you what we've seen from the SEC so far relative to the U.S. bond markets tends to be more focused on the retail space and specifically on free trade transparency for riskless trade. So I think that's been the early focus from the SEC. However, I can tell you from our own interactions with the SEC over the last six to nine months they are well aware of the much larger credit market and the growing challenges around secondary market liquidity and are working with all participants in the industry buy-side, sell-side, and platforms like MarketAxess and make sure that they can be a constructive and thoughtful partner on the regulatory side to develop new solutions to address that challenge.
Niamh Alexander: Okay, that sounds interesting. Maybe we will see something like an advisory committee or something like that coming out of it? It seems like the SEC just has very little resources allocated to the bond market right now so any kind of effort to maybe standardize things could be good for your business. Is that fair?
Rick McVey: Well, I think that they are increasing the resourcing and focus on the corporate bond markets and they already are gathering industry participants around roundtable discussions on this topic. They did so both in 2013 and more recently in 2014. So yes, I think this is a growing area of interest for the SEC.
Niamh Alexander: Okay, fair enough. Thanks. And then just lastly and I will get back on the line, the market data, we are kind of watching this especially coming out of Europe because that's where I think you get more deeply integrated with your customers as you are in the U.S. Where are you on the tape like product you are offering and where are you on kind of any regulatory mandate there as well?
Tony DeLise: Sure. We have been working with all of our clients, dealers, and investors, to develop and release data products that will help them to manage their risk. And there are two broad categories of that. One, are a series of volume and liquidity measures that we can develop through the Trax reporting data that will help both the buy-side and the sell-side better understand the liquidity characteristics of various bonds in the European region. With respect to the regulators most of this is scheduled to come to a head with respect to the regulatory changes in MiFID II in early 2017, but we continue to see a series of regulatory proposals rolling out, including what we saw from as much as before the holidays.
Niamh Alexander: Okay. I'll get back in line. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Ashley Serrao: Good morning, guys.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Ashley.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Ashley.
Ashley Serrao: So on Slide 6, you show a pie-chart of market list liquidity providers. I was curious how has volume from the dealer community in particular fared over the past few quarters? And then if you could just bifurcate trends between the regional dealers and the bulge brackets that would be helpful too.
Rick McVey: I'm sorry, Ashley. Can you repeat the first part of that question?
Ashley Serrao: Yes, so on slide 6, I believe, you show a pie-chart of the market list liquidity providers and I was just more curious about the dealer segment in that, how the trends fared there over the past few months and if there is any difference between the bulge brackets and some of the other regional providers?
Rick McVey: Sure. Yes, two parts to that. One, Open Trading is actually started to become an interesting liquidity pool for dealers to move risk as well as investors. So we see dealers participating in Open Trading both in sending their own enquiries in the market list in order to turnover their balance sheet positions more actively and also responding to trade enquiries that they may not have seen on a disclosed basis in the RFQ. So we do see dealers on both sides and I think there is a comfort level with the Open Trading solutions is growing in the dealer community. With respect to price responses, we see a couple of different things. Yes, we do see some of the regional dealer stepping up and providing more prices. We also see ETF market makers many of them within dealer organizations that are getting much more proactive about thriving price responses to market list orders. So there has been growth on both sides.
Ashley Serrao: Okay. And then with just respect to your Open Trading initiative, can you tell us how you're thinking about the capital that you will be setting aside to support this expansion into Europe? And then a second question just on risk. This quarter we saw a black swan event really hurt a lot of FX agency brokers and since you guys operate a riskless principal initiative I think, I was curious how you think about and even manage the credit risk around that initiative?
Rick McVey: Tony, you want to start with the capital question?
Tony DeLise: Yes, on the capital question, when we look at capital, and you look at our cash position first, we got about $234 million in dollars in cash and securities. We think about regulatory capital and actually sort of specific to Open Trading there is nothing unique or additive when it comes to the regulatory capital calculation relative to Open Trading. So it's part of our -- we do trade within our broker dealers in the U.S. and the UK. There is nothing unique or additive about what we're doing around is match principle, a risk less principle trading. We have talked in the past and we are consciously maintaining excess capital in the regulated entities. And so we've targeted an excess capital both in the U.S. and in Europe to facilitate Open Trading. We think it's important to show a healthy balance sheet in that regard. It gets our counterparties comfortable with taking our credit. But the amount of excess capital it's pretty transparent if you pull open our focus reports you would see in the U.S., we're maintaining something like $50 million of excess capital and in Europe it's around $25 million of excess capital.
Rick McVey: On counterparty risk actually important question and we think we're embracing best practices around both establishing counterparty credit lines and monitoring them. And the key difference is here as Tony mentioned one, the platform is an institutional trading platform and when we look at the riskless principle settlement risk that we carry approximately 75% to 80% of that risk is with large broker-dealers like CS and very large investment managers. So as you would expect based on our core business, most of the counterparty risk is with very large institutional market participants. The other thing is we do have a credit committee that Tony and I and others sit on that carefully considers new counterparties of MarketAxess and establishes lines for them based on their own capital and the size of the organization and importantly the products that they are trading and the volatility of those products. So we think even though it's institutional and its riskless match principle trades where we are exposed to counterparty risk during the three days settlement period, we think it's very important for us to have a sound counterparty risk management process and we're confident that we're managing that very carefully. And one other point on that as this part of our business grows; we have made it very clear to all traditional dealers that we are open to them providing this riskless clearing service for their clients. And we would expect to take up on that to grow as the volumes conducted in Open Trading continue to increase.
Ashley Serrao: Great. Thanks for all of the color there. I will just get back in the line.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Adams with Sandler O’Neill. Your line is now open.
Mike Adams: Good morning gentlemen. Congratulations on an impressive quarter.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Mike.
Tony DeLise: Thanks Mike. Good morning.
Mike Adams: So I would like to follow-up on Ashley's question regarding Open Trading and specifically your comments that the dealers are finding the Open Trading to be a new liquidity pool. So could you provide a little bit more color on the composition of that 7%? How much of that is just dealer to dealer? And then the second part of the question is -- is there any material difference in the average trade size in Open Trading versus the traditional RFQ?
Rick McVey: Yes, I think it's, I don't have the exact numbers this morning on transactions initiated by dealers that end up trading with another dealer. We know it's less than half. What's kind of interesting is that there is a growing percentage of dealer to client trades in market list where dealers are initiating market list orders and it's one of their clients that ends up providing the best price on the other side. So this is why everything we see it looks like increasingly it's an all-to-all liquidity pool with both orders being initiated and responses coming back from investors and dealers. With respect to trade size, given that this particular protocol is an extension of our RFQ model it is not a surprise to us that the average trade size is very similar to what we have been doing previously. So there are not key differences currently in the average trade size for Open Trading relative to traditional RFQ business. Having said that, we are working very hard with all of our clients and dealers on continuing to grow the menu of protocols that we have available for Open Trading. And there are far more protocols available on MarketAxess today than our clients are using and we will continue to enhance those protocols and add new ones so that we can address the liquidity challenge in a broader set of issues and in a broader range of trade sizes.
Mike Adams: Got it. Thanks, Rick. Now, to touch on high-yield, it looks like you picked up material market share in the fourth quarter and based on the new disclosures on slide 8, I am calculating around 7.5% share of TRACE volume, so is that a fair estimate? And really what is driving the pickup? Is it just simply the uptick in credit volatility or are you seeing a fundamental change in the way customers transact?
Tony DeLise: So Mike, on the first point, yes, you're right. It was around 7.4% or 7.5% for the market share. And we know all of you have been asking for a little more color on what's in that other credit category. So we did provide a little breakout there on one of the slides. And in terms of what's driving that high-yield market has been a little more volatile of late. And you see TRACE volumes for example have been up, were up appreciably almost 22% quarter-over-quarter. So you're seeing a little more volatility there, a little more trade opportunity. The other piece of it, not only -- and Rick made some comments on the prepared remarks. We have seen an uptick in our overall institutional clients trading, and even when we look within the high-yield product itself; we have almost 600 clients now that are trading high-yield. That's up more than 10% over 2013. So we are getting some more institutional clients there is more order flow over the platform. And this one when you look at the market share dynamics, how market share works. It's a function of two items. Order flow and hit rate and in this case what's driving the high yield market share gains is tremendous increase in order flow.
Mike Adams: Great. Thanks, Tony. Tony, another one for you. To touch on the expense outlook essentially in line with the long-term growth rate, it looks like your guidance is up 6% to 10% this year. So can you talk about the conditions that will influence whether you come in at the high-end or the low-end of the range? Just looking back at 2014 originally, we were talking about $150 million to $157 million in expenses. You came in at $144 million and you still grew revenues by 10%. So I'm just trying to figure out what your internal projections are for maybe top-line growth because it seems like maybe we are underestimating what you guys think you can do?
Tony DeLise: Well, Mike, what our sort of consistent response back in on the top-line piece of it, we typically don't provide that sort of guidance on share and capture and things of that nature. You're right on the expense side. What we're projecting and you could imagine what our budget looks like. The midpoint of this range is an 8% increase. A betting man would say that's probably where our baseline budget is, but you're also right that there are some swing factors in there and when 55% of our expenses are employee related and that's employee head counts, benefits, the incentive bonus, when 55% of our expenses are in that bucket. That's a big variable. And some of that tied to operating performance. We do have this variable bonus accruals tied to performance that variable; headcount is a big variable also. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that what we're projecting is headcount up it's somewhere between 5% and 7%. We've got a fair number, going into 2015, we had a fair number of open positions, these are replacement positions where we did have some attrition, we have upward the 15 replacement positions opened right now, we would like to get those filled. When we look at that 5% to 7% increase in headcount, 85% of it's in customer facing positions or technology. We would like to get those positions filled but sometimes it's out of our control a little bit. We want to get the right people sitting in the right seat and that's a swing factor. The swing factor is how quickly can we get the positions filled, what type of attrition will we experience. Those are swing factors.
Mike Adams: Okay. Thanks, Tony, and congrats again, guys. I am all set.
Tony DeLise: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning guys.
Rick McVey: Hello, Patrick.
Tony DeLise: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So with the yield curve flattening as much as it has during the quarter, I guess I was a little bit surprised that your high grade pricing held up as well as it did. As you think about that pricing as we enter into 2015, should we be expecting some compression due to what the yield curve has done or do you think this is kind of a stable level for you guys?
Tony DeLise: You know that fee capture one is a hard one to answer. We've got so many factors in there, Patrick. You're right the yield curve, it does influence trading and it adds more around years to maturity and absolute yield. There's other things like trade size and dealer and dealer mix and floating rate note fix, all of those things influence fee capture. What you see in the last couple of quarters is even with the flattening of the curve, you've seen short-term rates going up, long-term rates going down. You've seen that flattening of the curve. The years to maturity in our platform hasn't moved now. I'm just looking back at the chart here. It hasn't moved now in four quarters. We've been bubbling right around eight years to maturity. So even with that flattening it hasn't really influenced trading behavior and going forward when yields do rise, I mean, that's still -- it's obviously still open for debate and at least right now we're still trading from a year's to maturity standpoint. It's still within in the post-crisis range where we still have even with the flattening, it's still relatively steep yield curve even with the flattening. And as long as we've got dealers on all variable plans continue to win trades that's another influence. At least here and I'd say the very short-term here and you can include January in those comments and the very short-term, the fee capture has held up.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Got you. Appreciate that. Shifting gears to competition so -- and this was asked earlier but may be a different way to ask it is -- a lot of new competitors out there. Are you seeing anything in terms of trading protocols and trading solutions that those new venues are offerings that you guys don't offer and you think hey may be this is something we should be looking at ourselves?
Rick McVey: We spend an awful lot of time thinking about trading protocols around here, Patrick and importantly we spend a lot of time with our clients. And whether its individual meetings or round tables that we have hosted with some of the largest institutional investors and largest dealers, we think we've got a pretty good handle on the ideas around protocols and we think the investment budget here is larger than it is anywhere else with the new competitor's in-spite of our current leadership position. So we will, as part of the 2015 agenda, continue to enhance and add to those protocols. We are continuing to work with all of our clients on what they would like to see on the platform and the short answer is no. We really have not seen anything from the competition yet; it hasn’t been either discussed or already built here.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great, thanks. And then last one from me, obviously, you guys have seen your share price rise pretty nicely over the last quarter or so. To what extent is your share price going to play a factor in your repurchase sensitivity? Do you get a little more cautious with your personal activity where your stock is trading here or do you still kind of have the goal the one off set comp dilution or what's your thought process there at this point?
Rick McVey: Patrick, on the capital management or specifically on the repurchase side, that’s an ongoing topic internally and topic with our board. And we think we've been, we think we've been thoughtful around that topic and we've made use of buybacks in the past and we do look at things like where our share price is trading, we look at our own projections and our own view on value. And what you'll see from us and what you see right now is that we've been pretty consistent and we've been using the program and we will continue to use the program to offset dilution from employee grants. And Patrick, that’s probably sort of irregardless of where the price is now and our irregardless of where the price is, we will continue to use that plan to offset dilution from employee equity grant. And just to put it in perspective, if I were to give you some numbers around that, it’s a 200,000 shares per year. So that’s what we're talking about in terms of dilution. We also like having the plan in place. To be more aggressive if the opportunity arises and if we think they were trading at a significant discount to our fair value or DCF value we like having the plan in place but to be -- the exact answer to your question, yes, we're going to have a plan in place; yes, we're going to continue to sort of maintain or try to maintain that diluted share account outstanding.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Wong with Morningstar. Your line is now open.
Michael Wong: Okay, so headcount ended 2015 much lower than the 325 that you were aiming at earlier in the year. It seems like the 5%, 7% guidance for headcount growth in 2015 at the low and it would be below the 325 that you are aiming for this year and 7% just right at it. So were there any initiatives that you cancelled or have rethought of going into the next year that you were thinking of planning for this year?
Rick McVey: Really not, Michael. When you look at us today, we're a pretty simple company today and pretty simple to understand. We've got some core initiatives that we're focused on including open trading, including numbers of initiatives in Europe, and that continues to be the focus; and that’s very consistent with where we were in 2014. You are right also that what we're targeting or providing guidance to in terms of headcount at the end of 2015 would be similar to what we said last year. What I mentioned before had a fair number of positions open and in a perfect world it would be easy to source those positions and those bodies would be in place. I think what you're hearing is we’d like to fill some positions they're in customer facing areas in areas of focus; they're in technology positions for initiatives that we have underway, but there wasn’t anything that we cancelled. We didn’t have a new product launch on the drawing board that we decided not to go forward with. So it was just quite honestly merely the fact we couldn’t get the positions filled. So I wouldn’t look too much into that in terms of what we are targeting end of 2014 and what we are targeting at the end of 2015 and sort of the disparity there or common numbers there.
Michael Wong: Okay. And you mentioned little bit of employee attrition and kind of difficulty in filling positions, does this have anything to do with, let's say, the hiring environment or, let's say, the increase in competitors kind of in your space?
Rick McVey: I don’t think there is anything there, Michael. I mean when I meant little bit of attrition we're talking about a handful of people, nothing sort of broad slots of departures, and I can’t say that any of those departures were sort of competitive driven. And listen, on the -- look at our senior management team that we have here in the States and in Europe now none of it has come at those at the senior position.
Michael Wong: Okay, sounds great. And can you just comment on any affect of let's say a fight to safety or maybe just away from unusual events like oil or FX had on our business in the quarter or quarter to date such as either training of your European clients or high yield.
Rick McVey: Sure. If you look at the fourth quarter it's very similar to what we have seen over the last three years or so when volatility of credit spreads picks up and the focus shifts to secondary trading that tends to be very good for our market share. And I think it really comes back, Michael, to the fact that the credit markets are lot bigger today than they were five years ago. Corporate bond debt outstanding in the U.S. is up about 70%, and when volatility picks-up and especially when mutual funds have outflows and bonds need to move investor need new liquidity outlets and solutions. And we think that’s our primary focus is delivering those solutions, and the fourth quarter is an example that when we get those kind of market environment its very healthy for our share which ultimately is what drives our revenue and earnings growth.
Michael Wong: Okay. Thank you.
Tony DeLise: And Michael, just one thing to add on FX, and you’ve seen some movement here in the last two or three or four months, in particular, for us the one that we key on is the dollar versus the pound sterling, and in the fourth quarter the dollar appreciated considerably. As good as a fourth quarter for the top-line revenue numbers where we’ve probably hit around $500,000 or so; we do have sterling denominated revenue as a top-line revenue number. If the FX rate didn’t change it was similar to the third quarter revenues would have been a $0.5 million higher. So we are impacted by the change in the FX and even we look at 2015 and I think now but how I responded earlier on some of the swing factors; one swing factor that we should keep in mind is we do have a base of expense something like ₤30 million which are denominated sterling and to the extent if there is a change in the FX rate you can swing in our dollar reported figures. If it's something significant we’ll obviously comment on those in the coming quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ashley Serrao: Just wanted a follow-up on the comment you made around FX just let me think about a net basis revenues and expenses altogether on a net basis it hurt to was this a sterling or help you when you consider everything around these and expenses gather?
Rick McVey: Yes when we consider everything and this is sort of part of the improving profit fixture in Europe with the strengthening dollar it hurts us. Now sort of to put in perspective, if we have ₤30 million in expenses and the FX rate goes from, for example, $1.5 or one spot five or it is the today the $1.4 that the strengthening of the dollar that would reduce expenses by about $3 million, it would reduce revenues by something more than that. So and we get some details around our U.S. versus foreign source income in the 10-K, for example, in 2014, with something like $6 million of foreign source income. So it's not big number today but it’s a bigger piece of our business and we could be -- we could have some influence hear about around FX we haven’t you talked about that historically but as Europe grows there isn’t sensitivity there.
Ashley Serrao: Okay. And my other question was its been touched on a little bit but our [indiscernible] indicate that all the rivals that have launched with the past two years no one is really getting any traction. So I was just curious about how you guys are thinking about pricing either potentially raising it or maybe even raising volume tiers just what looks given what looks like increasingly solid moat around your franchise?
Rick McVey: We’ve had a very stable pricing plan for many years, Ashley, and we don’t anticipate any significant changes to that. What we want to do is make sure we’re delivering more value from money in 2015 to our clients. And I think the way that we’re going to do that is to continue to develop great trading solutions for dealers and investors that helped to address liquidity challenges, deliver great data products that help people to better manage their risk and invest in post-trade services primarily through tracks to help the European clients deal with the regulatory changes. So that’s our focus is on investing in those key areas for our client but at this time we don’t anticipate any significant pricing changes in 2015.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to hand the call back to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-22 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - Investor Relations Manager Rick McVey - Chairman and CEO Tony DeLise - Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts:  Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill Niamh Alexander - KBW Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse Michael Wong - Morningstar 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded October 22, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning. And welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimer statement in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2014 results. This morning we reported solid third quarter financial results with revenues of $64.2 million, up 5.1% from the previous year. Expenses for the quarter were up 3.5% to $36 million and pretax income was up 7.1% to $28.3 million compared to a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.46 for the quarter, up from $0.43 a year ago on an as adjusted basis. Our adjusted estimated share of U.S. high-grade TRACE in Q3 was 14.6%, up from 14% in Q2. Market conditions in the third quarter remained benign and were similar to prior quarters. Despite these conditions, product diversification continues to grow with a record quarter in other credit trading volumes. Volumes from European clients were up 59% during the quarter. Open Trading adoption rates continued to improve with increases in both completed trades and notional volume traded. Based on our strong cash flow and third quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.16 regular quarterly dividend. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Third quarter combined U.S. high-grade and high-yield TRACE volumes increased moderately by 5% compared to a year ago. Credit spreads and yields remained low and credit spread volatility was modest during the quarter. Investor demand for corporate bonds was primarily focused on the active new issue calendar during the quarter. Year-to-date U.S. high-grade new issuance totaled $758 billion, up 5% from last year’s robust level. Taxable bond funds experienced monthly net inflows throughout the first three quarters of 2014. The market environment began to shift at the end of September, resulting in our highest volume trading day ever with 6.5 billion in bond volume on month end. So far in October, we’ve seen increased volatility, bond fund outflows and a much wider new issue calendar. With greater focus on secondary trading, average daily TRACE high-grade and high-yield volume in October is approximately 10% higher than last October. While, the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally slow due to holiday periods, the first few weeks representing meaningful pick-up in secondary activity. Slide 5 provides an update on our key investment areas. We see significant progress in the adoption of our Open Trading protocols by both industrial clients and dealers. Since the beginning of 2014, over 25,000 Open Trading transactions have been completed on MarketAxess including almost 10,000 trades in the third quarter alone. The number of firms completing open trades continues to grow representing an important step towards the development of a valuable new source of liquidity for secondary credit markets. We believe that one of the distinguishing factors in our Open Trading success is the inclusion of a large base of dealers, investment managers and alternative market participants in the same trading pool. We are bringing a diverse set of clients into Open Trading to create new trading connections and improve market liquidity. In the alternative client category, we see growing activity from hedge funds and ETF market participants. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in our European business. Trading volumes from European clients increased 59% during the third quarter compared to a year ago. We are focused on expanding our liquidity pool in Europe through a combination of adding market making dealers and advancing new trading protocols. Our European infrastructure is now in place and we expect to see continued expansion in operating margins. In CDS, we saw an uptick in our CDS sales volumes during Q3, even though short-term revenue opportunities remained modest. Now I would like to hand the call over to Tony for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide 6 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were $182 billion for the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year. U.S. high-grade volumes were $110 billion for the quarter, down 4% year-over-year on a combination of a 2% decline in estimated high-grade trades volume and slightly lower market share. Volumes in the other credit category were up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2013, led by record quarterly high-yields volume and an 80% increase in European credit volume. Our liquid products trading volumes were down 11% on softer U.S. agency trading. On the second quarter earnings call, we provided some color on FINRA TRACE reporting of 144A securities and duplicate reporting of affiliate back-to-back trades. We realized that the noise around TRACE reported volumes create some challenges in estimating market share. FINRA recently determined to adding new reporting field to capture affiliate back-to-back trades, but we understand that the reporting will not begin production until sometime in the first half of 2015. So we’ll continue to report estimated trade volume and market share on a basis consistent with the prior years and have posted a file on our website displaying TRACE volume with and without 144A securities and adjusted for the estimated duplicate trade reporting. Slide seven displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $64.2 million were up 5% from a year ago, mainly on record commission revenue. The sequential drop in information and post-trade service revenue was largely due to a decline in market volumes reported through Trax. A tapering of revenue on a professional service engagement caused a sequential decline in technology products and services revenue. Total expenses were $36 million, up 3.5% in the third quarter of 2013. The operating margin percentage, and compensation and benefits ratio were consistent with the year ago levels. The effective tax rate was 38% for the third quarter and 37.5% for September year-to-date. We continue to track at the lower end of the 2014 effective tax rate guidance range of 37% to 40%. Our diluted EPS was $0.46 on a diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. The sequential decline in our diluted share count was principally due to share repurchases. On slide eight, we’ve laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 5% year-over-year as the growth in other credit trading volumes offset high-grade fee compression and lower estimated market volumes. U.S. high-grade fees per million of $177 was similar to the second quarter. The year-over-year decline in high-grade fees per million was due to a combination of lower duration, a shift to larger trade sizes and dealer fee plan migrations. The average years to maturity of bonds traded was 7.8 years, down from 8.7 years in the third quarter of 2013, but within the post-crisis range experienced on the platform. Fees per million in the other credit category were $316, up from $308 in the second quarter and nearly identical to the year ago level. The sequential increase in fee capture was due to a mix shift within this category with the heavier weighting to high-yield volume. U.S. high-grade distribution fees were up $700,000 compared to the second quarter of 2014, due principally to one dealer migrating to the major U.S. high-grade plan. During 2014, several euro bond dealers transitioned to fee plans and incorporate a higher level of variable fees and lower level of monthly distribution fees, resulting in a decline in the other credit category distribution fees. We expect fourth quarter total distribution fees will be similar to the third quarter level. Slide nine provides you with the expense detail. Third quarter 2014 expenses of $36 million were up 3.5% year-over-year and less than 1% sequentially. All of the expense categories were in line with the second quarter figures. September year-to-date expenses were up 12% over 2013. However, when we normalize 2013 expenses for the Xtrakter acquisition, the year-to-date expenses were up closer to our long-term expense growth rate of around 8%. The year-over-year increase in employee compensation and benefits was almost entirely attributable to higher headcount. Employee headcount was 305 at September month-end, up from 295 one year ago. As an attrition, we are expecting some headcount expansion through year-end to support our core initiatives. The year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the significant investment and product enhancements and technology over the past several years. We expect capital expenditures for full year 2014 will be within the guidance range of $15 million to $17 million. Professional and consulting fees have trended down versus prior year levels for the past three quarters. Lower technology consulting spend and legal fees were the driver behind the year-over-year decline. We expect full year 2014 operating expenses will be within the guidance range of $144 million to $148 million. On slide 10, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available for sale as of September 30th were $312 million, compared to $200 million at year-end 2013. During the third quarter, we repurchased 211,000 shares at a cost of $11.7 million under the upside $100 million share buyback program. As of September 30th approximately $75 million was available for future repurchases under the program. There was no change in our capital structure during the third quarter; we have no bank debt outstanding; and we didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks Tony. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum and a stronger competitive position across our core credit products with record volumes in our other credit category. Our Open Trading adoption rates are accelerating and represent growing interest in our all-to-all trading solutions. European results are improving and incoming European regulations will create new opportunities for trading and market data solutions. Now I will be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Mike Adams with Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill:  Good morning gentlemen.
Rick McVey: Hey Mike.
Tony DeLise: Hey Mike.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: So let me kick off with a couple of questions specific to the quarter here. Tony, to follow-up on some of your commentary on the non-commission businesses, the post-trade services, I think you said that there was just lower trade reporting at Xtrakter that accounted for the weakness this quarter. And I’m curious is that just lower overall industry volume or are you seeing certain market participants maybe shifting the reporting to other venues. What’s driving that?
Tony DeLise: Yes Mike, the sequential decline almost all of that was Trax volume related business. And when you look at that line item, around 55% of that line item is data related. So it’s both U.S. and European data product and 45% of it is Trax related. That 45% Trax related really is volume dependent. And we look at the sequential period; there was a slowdown in overall market volumes that does end up translating into reported volumes and trade matching on our platform as well. And we look over that period; the data piece of that line item was a slight uptick over the second quarter, but that decline in Trax volumes decline in market volumes was what attributed to the decline quarter-to-quarter.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Got it. And then and Tony another one for you, just I noticed the headcount slipped as of September 30, it was down like 4% or so and a little surprising just because you’ve talked about adding headcount to support some growth initiatives. So, where did those reductions occur? And I guess there was just natural attrition or was there some minor restructuring that you still get 325 to 330 by year-end?
Tony DeLise: Right, right. There was a decline end of Q2 to end of Q3 and quite frankly I probably should have done a better job explaining the increase at the end of the second quarter, but we look at the decline in the third quarter there were 9 or 10 in-turns that we had that rolled off during the quarter. There were also some terminations during the quarter and it was the combination of both management initiated terminations and some voluntary terminations. The combination of the in-turns rolling off and the terminations, there was about 20 altogether and then we did have hire. So, we did have a half of dozen or some new hires during the period. The second part of the question, what does that mean for year-end and what are we projecting right now; we still have 15 or 16 or 17 open positions, we’re actively engaged in recruiting and trying to get those positions filled then on boarded. Some of those positions are already filled and committed to. I think at this stage if we were targeting 325 which was our original budget, it’s going to be tough to get to that 325 number. So, we’ll probably fall little bit short of that goal. And not for lack of trying we just want to make sure we get the right people in there with the right ability to fill the position. But we’ll probably fall a little bit short to that year-end target.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Got it. Thanks Tony. And then Rick just shifting gears talking about some of the market conditions. Some of the recent weakness in the credit markets, I think it’s broad liquidity concerns in the corporate bond market to the forefront again. Just curious what the immediate impact on businesses you see elevated inbound call volume or clients more engaged on the platform testing Open Trading protocols, any color would be appreciated?
Rick McVey: All the above. I think the most immediate change has been the increase in TRACE volume. And I personally think that volatility has the potential to bring higher TRACE activity because the base of corporate debt is up about 60% since ‘08. And we are seeing that early on in the fourth quarter, most importantly in high-yield where volatility has been the greatest and spread levels now have moved wider and are almost back to where we were in the taper tantrum in the second quarter of ‘13. And if you look at high-yield TRACE so far in October, it’s up about 30% versus last October’s average daily volume. So, the secondary market activity is up. We continue to believe that the adoption rates for Open Trading will accelerate with more volatility and more focus on secondary trading. In the early days that seems to be the case. So, this is another environment where we’re getting greater volatility and greater interest in electronic trading.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Got it. And then October, I don’t think you commented on market share. Do you mind giving us an update there and how things have been trending?
Rick McVey: Yes. Similar to last quarter, we still have eight trading days left in October, so hesitate to give guidance on where the full month will come out with so many important trading days still in front of us. But based on the trend that we’re seeing so far this month, we would expect a modest increase in market share versus the third quarter average.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Got it. Thank you guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW. Your line is open.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: Hi. Thanks, good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
Rick McVey: Hi Niamh.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: Hi. And if I could just go back to Europe for a bit, Rick. You’ve done the Xtrakter deal last year, you’ve had quite a few quarters of integration. Now I know, we get some seasonality over there, you get a lot of seasonality over there typically. But help me think about where you are versus where you were hoping to be and do you still feel as good about the market data, revenue opportunities, the potential to integrate there, maybe to build into the commissions on that and has a timing shifted a little bit there at all or just where do we go from here?
Rick McVey: Yes. No change, right. I think that we view the European business holistically and feel good about the expanded product capabilities we have with trading data and post-trade services. We as you know are closing in on the completion of a major technology project to rewrite the infrastructure at Trax, feel good about that. And we’re getting great encouragement in the early days of some of the new data products that are just rolling out. So, this is all the matter of timing, but there is a lack of quality, turnover volume, liquidity information in Europe and even pricing information and we’re working with the industry there on delivering more data to fill that gap. And we remain optimistic that this will be a growth area for us into the end of the year and into next year. And I do think that some of the progress that we’ve made on the trading side is attributable to the broader product offering that we now have in Europe. So really encouraged by the growth in number of clients trading and the significant pick up in year-over-year volume that we’re seeing in Europe.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: Okay, fair enough. So I guess the 59% growth from the European clients you’ve seen that come through in the existing U.S. product as well high-yield on EM maybe more so than Eurobond. But for us to think about the market data side of it as well and which is where you’re very strong typically, I mean is that more of a maybe second half 2015 that we should start to build in some additional revenue for that particular part of it?
Rick McVey: Yes. I think throughout 2015, we’re optimistic we will see growth in the data revenue line. Tony made some comments specific to Eurobond. So a significant part of our growth during the quarter from European clients was in Eurobonds within the region. There is a lot of emerging market trading that takes place with European clients as well; and that’s been an important component of our growth.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: Okay, fair enough. That’s helpful. Thanks Rick. And then I imagine this time of the year a lot of companies and yours included are probably going through your budgeting for next year. Can you help me think about what - right now you’ve got through big initiatives and you’ve continued to invest in those initiatives, Europe, the Open Trading and then the Trax. Are those three kind of still the big priority for the next year ahead and should we help -- is it kind of spend rate likely to be the same in the investment?
Tony DeLise: You’re right. We’ve had those three big initiatives for a couple of years now around Europe and the Trax business, around Open Trading and around CDS. Sitting here today, it’s still three big initiatives. Although I’ll tell you on the CDS side and this is absent having a rule set from the SEC on the CDS side, we’re largely through the technology build, the big legal spend around responding to the CFTC rules, are largely behind us and that spend has come down for CDS, so where the run rate the last couple of years had been closer to $6 million, we look at the current run rate and it’s probably not quite past that number but it’s around the $4 million level. And again absent a rule set from the SEC and having to respond to that that’s probably a better run rate around CDS. Let’s say on the Europe side, and Rick has made some comments on Europe, I mean we are largely through a technology rebuild on the Trax side. We’re in the midst of some data center moves out of some euro cleared data centers into our existing data centers. We think we have the infrastructure in place; and I am talking about people and technology. And that’s not to say we won’t continue to invest, but we are -- at this point in Europe it’s all about leverage and it’s all about driving the top-line revenue number forward, still obviously a very big focus, but those big sort of chunky spends will largely be behind us. And I think anything around Open Trading, it’s still -- we are still testing protocols. We’re still launching new functionality. There is still a big investment there; it’s a big part of our focus. It’s a little early to talk about guidance right now for next year but you’ve seen what our long-term expense rate looks like. We’ve been in that 6% or 8% range. You’ve seen what CapEx looks like in a more normalized environment; we’ve responded to that in the past, it’s probably the $12 million to $15 million range and the normal run rate, most of that product enhancements. And the effective tax rates, while there is some one-time items in there, it’s been very consistent the past three years.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: Okay. I think that’s very helpful. Thank you, Tony. I appreciate it you’re pointing us to there. And then if I could on maybe back to Rick on the industry environment, I mean you’ve been very helpful in talking about October so far and the hike in volatility. But there is a kind of bigger scene developing in terms of there is a lot of concern about lack of liquidity especially if there is lot of bonds moving one way. How -- and we’ve seen one big industry participant on the buying side kind of publish resource the regulators are paying attention. Do you think we’re closer to getting some change like maybe towards standardized products to assess the situation, is MarketAxess in a good position to have a [center in] order book to kind of be one of the venues at the front of the line there?
Rick McVey: With respect to standardized product it makes all the sense in the world to us. They have more standardization and a fewer bond issues in the credit space, but that’s going to be a long-term change. In the early days, there is no sign that issuers have changed their issuance patterns yet. So, we still have a highly fragmented secondary corporate bond market. But greater standardization and fewer issues, we think would be one of the solutions to increase overall market turnover and liquidity. I think what we’re seeing now is that the adoption rates are picking up, we’re seeing nice sequential growth in Open Trading and you kind of see 20% to 30% increases in clients that are getting involved in trading volume. I think where you’ll see an acceleration of that is when clients needed the most, which is when the focus is on the secondary trading market. And in the early part of the fourth quarter, we’ve had two or three weeks of that. But the market hasn’t been tested because the investment industry has that inflows over the last three to four years and most of that money has gone to work in the new issue calendar. And I think if you look at high-yield now this is the beginning of the test on the secondary market. And I’d say, it’s our believe that we will see the story of necessity being the mother of invention coming through where clients realize that given a much large credit market and smaller balance sheet capacity within the dealer community, they do need to change their behavior in order to facilitate efficient secondary trading. And that’s the reason for the massive investment that we’re making in protocols. And we get to a center in their order book maybe for a small slice of that corporate bond market. It’s hard and given the amount of turnover today to see a broad base of the activity. But remember, we have a menu of protocols already available for investors and dealers in Open Trading. And arguably, the protocols are out ahead of the shift that we’ve seen so far in industrial behavior. We have much more available than people are using today including a central limit order book, which is live today for single name CDS Trading. So that -- we are continuing to invest and enhance those protocols, but there is a lot of work going on with respect to changing investor behavior and getting more people participating and using the Open Trading protocols that are available.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James: Hey, good morning guys.
Rick McVey: Hello Patrick.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James: I want to follow-up on the information services -- information posted services line. So, obviously a little bit of seasonality there in the third quarter with lower volumes. I guess I was maybe expecting that some of your growth initiatives that you have in terms of broadening the distribution of that data and selling more data products would offset some of that seasonality. So, as we think about that line going forward, what sort of growth do you think is ahead of you in terms of broadening the distribution on those Trax data products?
Tony DeLise: Patrick, Rick responded before to one of the earlier questions around that .It is -- we’re still very bullish on the data outlook. We are in the midst of rolling out new data product. The sales cycle does take a little bit longer here. And it’s something in the fourth quarter and beyond. Now in terms of sizing it up, a lot of what we’re doing is also around promoting more flow onto our platform. In some cases, the data products will be just to do that will be to put more eye balls and draw more flow onto our platform. It’s difficult to circle the number right now and tell you what we’re expecting in terms of growth out of that, but it is one of our focus areas. It’s one of the areas that we expect to improve the margin fixture of our European franchise overall. It’s one of those areas we’re expecting revenue growth from.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James: Got you. And then I guess to push a little bit further on Europe. I know that you guys have been trying to get the buy-side to push beyond that fix dealer cap for some of the smaller I think some $5,000 trade, the 5,000 euro. Can you just talk about how that is going and what the opportunity or the potential to see to try to push the buy-side to going beyond the fix dealer cap for all of their trades in Europe?
Rick McVey: We’ve mentioned in the past, we have provided more investor choice in terms of how they use this system. It’s always up to them to determine how they would like to use the protocols and how broadly they’d like to send their electronic orders. But what we’ve seen in the odd lots in Europe is that they have embraced more dealer choice and more competition in those kind of orders. And we also, we get mixed reviews from dealers, but some of them quite like it because dealers today don’t necessarily want to take on more inventory in odd lots that come with higher capital requirements than they used to. So investors are going broadly; they’re having good success with that, it’s attracting new dealers to our European system. We believe that over time Europe is going to need an open architecture, at least as much as the U.S., based on everything we can see on transaction cost and liquidity and capital requirements for the key participants there, but it’s likely to be a gradual evolutionary process to get there.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James: Got you. It makes sense, thanks. And I guess lastly from me, so certainly we keep hearing about all these different new corporate bond, electronic corporate bond trading that are coming on. Are there any trading protocols that you have seen and it is new venues proposed that you say hey this is interesting, this is something that we think we should pursue or by and large do you guys have kind of the complete set of protocols already in place?
Rick McVey: Well we don’t have any good ideas but we spend a lot of time and energy everyday thinking about this and talking to every major client and dealer about it. And as a result of all that work with clients, everything that we know they could add value to improve liquidity, we’ve either built and it’s available now or it will be available soon. So it won’t be a gap in protocols here. We’re spending a lot of time with our clients and we are very focused on this topic, because we think the industry needs it. And there is no shortage here of technology investment going into offer those protocols. And as I said right now, the only thing keeping us from having a much stronger open trading offering is investor behavior, it’s not shortage of technology or any gaps in protocols. And we have a huge start, we have approximately 150 or so institutional investors; they are active on the system and nearly a 100 dealers connected and integrated into the trading platform. We have a lot of content with the base of orders that are already in the system. And we think we have a head start and are making bigger investments than anyone in the industry in enhancing and adding protocol. So, there is a big start there and what we’re really working on with investors is altering their trading process, so that they can more actively participate and utilize these new tools in order to take control of their own destiny and be better prepared for the future.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy - Raymond James: Got it. Thanks for the commentary.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: Hey guys, thanks. So, I was trying to go back to Open Trading and your trade count has been growing really amazing for the past couple of quarters. I was wondering if you could give us an idea for like what percentage of your high-grade value traded and that trade count represents? And then maybe also if you could just give us an idea for what percentage of your Open Trading trade count is actually being done between two clients versus like a client to dealer or dealer to dealer that’s run through the Open Trading protocol?
Rick McVey: Yes, two good questions, Jillian. First, it’s grown to about 4% or so of our trade count and trade volume, so a nice increase. And I think when that approaches 10% or more, it will start to become a more visible and relevant source of liquidity for both dealers and investors on the platform. And we did provide in the pie chart in the prepared remarks some guidance on where prices are coming from when orders go into market list in our Open Trading protocols. And roughly speaking, it’s kind of interesting because most people jump to this conclusion that it’s all client-to-client. That’s just not the case and the interesting thing is how we’re bringing many different and some new market participants into that pool of orders. So about 40% of the prices back come from investment managers, about 40% comes from a community of alternative market makers and I highlighted in my comments two segments; ETF market makers and hedge funds. And about 20% come from dealers that in most cases did not see the order on a disclosed basis and are responding instead through the Open Trading protocols. I think this is really important. This is not just client-to-client; we have dealers, investors, ETF market markers, hedge funds all in that same pool. And ultimately we think that this is the right path to the solution for the new model in secondary trading.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. That’s helpful. And then I think Patrick’s question kind of getting it, but with Tradeweb now having I guess at least soft line to their platform. Just wanted to get kind of an update from you on what you’re hearing from your clients and what if any competitive advantages that platform might have or if basically there is very little information out there on it, so I’m just wondering if you have heard anything that we haven’t?
Rick McVey: Yes. We talked extensively with all of you in the last call because it was right in the midst of what we are hearing with the Tradeweb corporate bond launch. Early days for them, and as I mentioned in the last call, this is not the first launch in corporate bonds; we believe it’s the fourth. And so they have been down this road before. But what we’re hearing is that there is not much change in the outcome. Again we respect them as a competitor. We expect them to invest in credit and all the other areas that they have been recently. And it is early days, but in the first three months of trading, we have not heard much about trading activity from dealers or investors on the Tradeweb platform. And also I’d point you to one other external data point on competitive position and market share that came out during the quarter which was the Greenwich Associates’ e-trading survey for credit on the over 1,000 institutional investor interviews that they conducted during their spring survey period. And I think all of you started asking a lot more about competition a little over a year ago. And we probably all have a hard time coming up with all the names that have been in and out of the market already over the last five quarters. But what I found interesting about Greenwich is over the last year they actually show that MarketAxess increased our percentage of the e-share. So they show us going from strength-to-strength based on what they’ve heard from 1,000 investors in their survey. And as I mentioned that summary came out from Greenwich about a month ago.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then just one more question for me; you guys have been retaining some excess capital on the balance sheet around the past year, so I think because you’ve been enacting at that and the demand for the Open Trading. And I think last time we spoke you said you were still trying to determine whether longer term you’d outsource that or whether you will continue to perform it in-house. So, I want to get an update on where you are in that decision process and how it’s kind of influencing your decisions in capital deployment?
Tony DeLise: Sort of happy to respond to that, we were acting as a riskless principal with electronically matched trades. So, based on what we’re doing today, we’re scratching the surface of the available capital that we currently have. So, we really don’t see a scenario any time soon where there we would need to think differently about capital management because of what we’re clearing in Open Trading. And it’s my belief, Julian that as this grows; our percentage of clearing will go down. And the reason for that is we already see positive signs from major dealers that they are embracing Open Trading in a different way than they did six months ago. We’ve been working very closely with major dealers individually and as groups on our ways for them to stay involved in Open Trading to support it to utilize that liquidity pool for their own purposes and needs. And we’re making great progress there. And I think the next step of that is that they will offer a similar clearing service to their large investor clients, which we actively embrace. And when they do that I believe that our percentage of clearing will go down. So, I really don’t think it’s relevant currently to think too much about any capital changes on the back of Open Trading clearing.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse: Good morning guys. Rick, can you talk about the sense of urgency that the red leaders have in reforming the market? It feels like the retro is picking up, but from the discussions with them, do you feel that they are working to the time line of sorts? And I ask, because a lot of the ideas put forward by BlackRock are really not knew, they’ve been talked about for well over a year. What’s stopping the reg leaders from listening to such large influential participant?
Rick McVey: I think they are listening. We’ve had a series of meetings with the SEC recently and I can confirm that their attention and focus on the credit markets has increased. And I do think they are rightly concerned about the market structure issues and well aware that the market has gotten a lot larger and the regulatory changes have caused significant shift in market making capacity. It’s a big topic. And the regulators don’t move forward with changes in a short period of time. So, I think it’s early stages, but I can categorically tell you that they are concerned about the issue and they are talking to influential participants in the market to try and get a sense of what they might do in order to be a constructive part of the solution and the new market structure.
Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse: Got it. Thanks for the color there. And just a follow-up question on your thoughts on market share so far this quarter. I was surprised that you said that you expected to be modestly higher. Just given that issuance is meaningfully down, we’re hearing there are liquidating challenges in the market. What, is there something missing in that picture, or why don’t you more meaningfully hire?
Rick McVey: I think you’re worried, this may take a little bit actually. We’ve got eight trading days left and on the tenth day from now, you’ll have our results. And all I can tell you is we’re seeing the same theme that when volatility picks up in the credit markets, TRACE volumes go up and electronic share goes up. So we feel really good about it. And we’ve never had in my opinion quite as much momentum across every product area as we have now where product diversification is really improving. And it’s rare to see the arrows all pointing in the same direction when you look at European activity, high-yield EM, the high-grade market starting to shift, TRACE volumes moving up. So again, this is only a two or third week period and it’s hard to know whether it will be sustained in the short-term, but I think we would all bet on more volatility in the future than we’ve seen over the last three to four years and that looks to us like it’s very healthy for our business.
Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse: Thanks for the color there. And I guess final one for Tony. No real change to expense guidance this quarter. But can you walk us through the puts and takes as we head into 4Q; what gets to the middle or top of your expense guidance?
Tony DeLise: Actually it’s probably, in fairness, this is probably going to be tough to get to that middle or high-end of the expense guidance. And you look at it today and substantial base of the expenses going into the fourth quarter, you can call them fixed at this point in time. And quite frankly, the biggest variable is what Rick has been talking about. The biggest variable we have are market conditions. And it’s the impact on what that means to our business to our commission revenue. And where that flows through is on our incentive compensation accruals. And that’s really the biggest variable at this point in time and to a lesser extent, some of the comments I made around headcount, some of the movements there could influence the expense run rate a little bit. But again, it’s mostly market conditions commission revenue and how that flows to the incentive comp. But I do think given where we are through the first nine months looking at where we were in the third quarter getting to the sort of middle or upper-end, I’m not sure that we have that in the equation right now. Although, listen if we have what’s occurred in the first couple of weeks here, again we’re not suggesting that’s the case for the remainder of the quarter, but the first couple of weeks gives us some optimism on market condition.
Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse: All right. Thanks for taking my questions guys.
Operator: Our next quarter comes from Michael Wong with Morningstar. Your line is open.
Rick McVey:  Good morning Michael. 
Michael Wong - Morningstar:  So talk about decreased liquidity in the capital markets due to higher banking regulations has resurfaced lately. Overall do you see less liquidity in the overall market or would you say the liquidity has migrated from large banks to regional broker-dealers and buy-side firms?
Rick McVey: Yes. Based on our [interim] numbers and others, you don’t really see overall that there is a change in dealer concentration, still a substantial amount of the share are in the hands of the top 10 dealers. When we think about market liquidity, we look at overall credit market turnover and transaction costs. And turnover is down substantially over the last three years. The base of outstanding debt is much larger and TRACE volumes have been broadly flat. And I think that’s partly because market conditions have been so benign overall and partly it’s because investors have a harder time moving large trades through the markets than they used to and transaction costs are higher than they used to be pre-crisis. So this, I believe that this will become even more relevant when we have a sustained period of higher market volatility and investors need to move more positions.
Michael Wong - Morningstar: Okay. And with long-term rates generally declining this year, have you seen a change in trading patterns that was different than you were expecting at the beginning of the year and did that change your strategy or thoughts during the year at all?
Rick McVey: Not really. I think it has extended the period in which investors have had inflows and have had money put to work, it’s facilitated another big year in new issuance. So, more of what we’ve seen over the last two or three years, but we’re investing for the long-term. We think that there is a seismic shift going on in market structure and we need to be a constructive part of that with the industry and with our dealer-investor clients. And we are ramping up the investment budget to provide those solutions.
Michael Wong - Morningstar: Okay. Thank you.
Rick McVey: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from (inaudible) with Parameter Capital. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thank you for taking the call.
Rick McVey: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst : I’d like to talk just briefly to what about share buybacks and if that’s a great use of your capital at this point in time?
Rick McVey: Jimmie I think capital management it’s an ongoing topic with our Board. And in terms of the repurchase plan, we like having the program in place. We had adapted that plan earlier in 2014 mainly to offset the impact of equity grants. We did expand that plan in the second quarter. And we’ve been sort of consistent with how we’ve acted in the past. We’ve tended to be more aggressive around repurchases when we think we’re trading at a significant discount to fair value. And the new grid that we’ve set up is set up to perform in the manner where it is more aggressive at lower prices and it’s less aggressive in higher prices. The Board has been thoughtful around capital management and repurchases and dividends overall. We’ve made use of both repurchase and dividends in the past. And considering things like cash flow our cash balance, our share price, future projection, it’s an ongoing topic. And again we’d like to have the existing program in place right now.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: I just have two quick things. I think Tony you might have said this in your prepared remarks, but I missed it. So, did you say what the CapEx was on for the quarter?
Tony DeLise: The year-to-date CapEx is a shade over $11 million.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: Okay.
Tony DeLise: I don’t have the quarterly number in front of me, but the shade over $11 million. Our full year guidance range is $15 million to $17 million. And right now what we’re projecting is we’ve come in at the low-end of that range. So, think about it as around $4 million per quarter.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, got it. And then you mentioned something about the technology products revenue like there are some reason why it declined in the quarter, I know you said it, but I just couldn’t catch it?
Tony DeLise: Yes. It’s -- when you look at that line item, it’s technology products and services about 75% of that of the revenue there is project management related, it’s for companies in the technology space. But it’s not a big part of our revenue or revenue plan and it’s not -- these types projects, they’re not core to our business, it’s not really an area of emphasis, we’re not out promoting or soliciting engagements like that. And we did have this one large engagement, which at this point is winding down, it’s tapering down. And we would expect the revenue on that one line item, the technology products and services revenue, if you were building out the model, I’d expect that line to decline over time. Again, it’s not a big piece of what we’re doing, it’s not really an area of emphasis, it was -- the particular engagement was an important one, but it is tapering down right now.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Adams with Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open. Mike, if your line is on mute, can you please unmute it?
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Can you hear me now?
Rick McVey: Now, we can.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Okay, great. Just two housekeeping items. First, what was the percentage of high-yield EM in terms of the overall credit, other credit volume?
Tony DeLise: It was in -- just bear with me a second Mike. It was right around 81% or 82%. It’s still sort of dominated by high-yield and EM. But you look at the growth in that category, clearly year-over-year Eurobond outpaced EM and high-yield but still a larger percentage, still -- the bulk of it coming from EM and high-yield.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Got it. And then I apologies if I missed this. But Xtrakter, what was the revenue and pretax contribution this quarter?
Tony DeLise: Mike, we’re really not breaking out those figures anymore. I’ll tell you that on -- and the reason why, I mean this is really -- we’re looking at this business in totality. The European franchise, it’s a cross-trading post-trading data. It’s an integrated business. And if you just sort of pull the statutory accounts for this legal entity, what you’re going to see is operating margins around 10% or 12% right now. We do expect those margins to expand. There has not been significant revenue growth to-date. If you think about that, we said in the past it was running at about $24 million to $25 million in revenue. So, you’ve got all the pieces there, but in terms of breaking it out separately, it’s really not how we’re necessarily looking at it. This European franchise we have integrated business and sort of losing it some -- losing its singularity in that way. So, but the margins look like the historical margins there if we were to break it out separately.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Okay. So I mean -- the reason I asked is because you talked about it being accretive in the back half of the year. And just given some of the commentary around the post trade services revenue declining, but I was just curious was it -- did you see some accretion in that business in 3Q?
Tony DeLise: Yes, through the first nine months it’s been fairly consistent. It’s been running at about 10% or 12% operating margin before deal cost and that’s before amortization of intangibles. You [fill] in the amortization, it’s around breakeven. And we still do expect it to be mildly accretive in the second half of the year.
Mike Adams - Sandler O’Neill: Okay. Thanks Tony.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. And we look forward to catching up with you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today’s conference. You may all disconnect. And everyone have a great day.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-23 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Dave Cresci – IR Manager Rick McVey – Chairman and CEO Tony DeLise – CFO
Analysts:  Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill & Partners Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James Hugh Miller – Sidoti Niamh Alexander – KBW Michael Wong – Morningstar Equity Research 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded July 23, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. For the call is Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2014 results. We are pleased to report record revenues this quarter of $65 million in spite of the soft secondary trading conditions in fixed income throughout the quarter. Our momentum is evident in both emerging markets and high-yield trading where we set new quarterly volume records, and in Europe where our client volumes were up 28%. As a remainder, secondary market conditions in the second quarter of last year were very different on the back of the Fed’s tapering announcement, leading to rising interest rates, higher volatility and wider credit spreads. In retrospect, last year’s second quarter was an anomaly in the multi-year trading environment trends. Pre-tax income in the quarter just completed was down 2.5% to $29.1 million, and diluted EPS was $0.48 compared to $0.49 in the second quarter of 2013. Expenses were up 6.6% to $35.9 million. These year-over-year comparisons exclude the benefit of the out-of-period adjustment last year for the capitalization of certain software-related expenses. Our adjusted estimated share of U.S. high-grade TRACE in Q2 was 14%. TRACE reported volumes show an increase on or around April 1 of double reported transactions versus prior years. Based on our own TRACE analysis and conversations with FINRA and several large dealers, we believe this double reporting has the effective increasing TRACE reported volume by approximately 3% versus prior periods. Our market share adjustment reduces trades volume by 3% to eliminate this double counting and make more accurate comparisons to prior periods. Due to our strong cash flow and excess cash position, our board approved an increase in our share repurchase program from $35 million to $100 million, and a regular quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share. We believe that share repurchases will continue to improve long-term returns for our shareholders. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions during the quarter remain largely consistent with the first quarter of 2014. Combined U.S. high-grade and high-yield TRACE volumes were comparable to both the prior year and previous quarter levels, while credit spreads remained near all-time lows. Credit spread volatility also remained low reducing the need for active portfolio turnover in the secondary markets. The quarter saw continued robust U.S. high-grade new issuance, up 20% compared to the second quarter of last year. The U.S. corporate debt market continues to get larger and is approaching a record $10 trillion. Corporate debt outstanding is up more than 50% since the end of 2008. We have observed a positive correlation between high-grade new issuance and the percentage of TRACE volume represented by block trades. In the short-term, investor focus on new issuances and higher block trading volumes have a dampening effect on our estimated market share. Excess demand for corporate bonds is evidenced in their current low level of credit spreads and in the low hit rates for offer wanted business on the MarketAxess trading system. We believe that more balanced order flow would improve overall hit rates. Slide 5 provides an update on our key areas of investment. Open Trading creates all-to-all trading connections on the network and continues to be a major area of focus for the company. During the quarter, the number of active clients utilizing Open Trading protocols grew from approximately 175 firms to 260 firms. While Open Trading still accounts for a relatively small portion of our overall trading volumes, we are encouraged by the roughly 35% increase in prices back and trades completed in Q2 versus the first quarter. We are seeing increased Open Trading adoption from both, dealer and investor clients, and we are confident that we are on the right track to build valuable new sources of liquidity for secondary credit markets. We see continued improvement in our European business. Trading volumes from European clients were up 28% during the second quarter and European revenues were 20% of total company revenues. We are working on a number of enhancements to our Trax reporting, matching and data services in response to new incoming European regulations. Our Trax technology rebuild is on schedule for completion this year. In CDS, we did see an increase in our CDS SEF volumes in market share during Q2. Important regulatory questions remain on CFTC rule interpretation and SEC rules for CDS single-name trading. In the short-term, aggregate CDS SEF volumes are lower than we expected, and regulatory costs to operate SEFs are far greater than current SEF revenues. Now I would like to hand the call over to Tony for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 6 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were within 1% of the record volumes reported one year ago. U.S. high-grade volumes were $116 billion for the quarter, down roughly 2% year-over-year. Adjusted estimated high-grade market share of 14% is largely flat with last year’s 14.1%. Volumes in the other credit category were up 11% compared to the second quarter of 2013, led by record quarterly volumes in both high-yield bonds and emerging market debt. Our reported liquid products trading volumes were down 25%, largely due to the 37% decline in TRACE reported agency bond volumes. Beginning June 30, FINRA initiated reporting of 144A securities. Based on conversations with FINRA in July month-to-date activity, we believe that 144A securities could add 10% to 15% to high-grade TRACE volumes and more than 50% to high-yield TRACE volumes. FINRA has not yet made available any historical data, so we don’t have the ability today to accurately recast our historical high-grade market share. Share will go down with the 144 inclusion, but we would expect that the trend line in high-grade market share over the past several years would remain consistent with the previously reported figures, while at the same time the total secondary market opportunity is larger. Slide 7 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $65 million were up 2% from a year ago on higher data sales and technology consulting revenue. To provide a better comparison of year-over-year results, the second quarter 2013 figures have been adjusted to exclude a one-time out-of-period adjustment related to the capitalization of certain employee costs previously expense has incurred. Total expenses were $35.9 million, up 7% from the second quarter of 2013. The year-over-year increase was consistent with our longer term expense growth rate. The effective tax rate was 37% for the second quarter and for June 30 year-to-date. Many factors can influence the tax rate, and we are currently tracking at the low-end of the 2014 guidance range of 37% to 40%. Our diluted EPS was $0.48 on a diluted share count of 37.9 million shares. The sequential decline in our diluted shares from the first quarter of 2014 was principally due to share repurchases. On Slide 8, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were down 3% year-over-year due to the 1% decline in trading volume and a 2% decline in overall fees per million. U.S. high-grade fees per million were $178 in the second quarter. The average years to maturity of bonds traded of 7.6 years was consistent with the first quarter and within the post-crisis range experienced on the platform. The uptick in fee captured from the first quarter level was mainly due to a minor shift in trade sizes. The year-over-year decline in high-grade fees per million was due to a combination of lower durations and a shift to larger trade sizes. Fees per million in the other credit category were $308 in the second quarter, up $7 on a sequential basis and nearly identical to a year ago level. The sequential increase in fee capture was due to a mix shift within this category slightly favoring higher margin emerging markets and high-yield volumes and higher Eurobond fee capture. U.S. high-grade distribution fees were up $1.2 million compared to the second quarter of 2013, due principally to several dealer migrations to the major U.S. high-grade dealer plan in the second half of last year. One additional U.S. high-grade dealer followed the same path in July 2014. We expect third quarter total distribution fees will be several hundred thousand dollars higher than the second quarter level. Slide 9 provides you with the expense details. Second quarter 2014 expenses of $35.9 million were up less than 1% sequentially. The sequential drop in employee compensation and benefits was due to $900,000 seasonal decline in employment taxes and benefits, offset by higher wages and incentive compensation. Employee headcount was 318 at June month end, up from 300 at March 31. Professional and consulting fees tend to vary quarter-to-quarter and are influenced by the level of expenses surrounding IT, consulting, legal, recruiting, audit tax and other fees. The sequential decline is largely due to lower legal and recruiting fees. The sequential increase in all other expenses is primarily due to higher sales and marketing spend in support of new business initiatives. We are now midway through the year and have greater visibility on our operating expense and CapEx forecast for 2014. We are reducing our full year guidance and now expect total expenses will be in the range of $144 million to $148 million, and our capital expenditures will be in the range of $15 million to $17 million. We are continuing to invest in our core initiatives and are on track to meet our year-end headcount goal. The decision earlier this year to consolidate data centers, the timing of new hire on-boarding and lower variable incentive compensation were the principal drivers behind the guidance reductions. On Slide 10, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available for sale as of June 30 were $199 million compared to $200 million at year-end 2013. Free cash flow was a record $76 million for the trailing 12 months during a period when we have been investing heavily in Europe, Open Trading, CDS and other initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 189,000 shares at a cost of $10.4 million under the $35 million share buyback program we initiated in March. As Rick mentioned, the board took action in July to increase the buyback authorization to $100 million. The original program was established to offset dilution from employee equity grants. This expansion allows us to repurchase more shares when we believe the share price is undervalued. There was no change in our capital structure during the quarter. We have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks Tony. Second quarter results reflect continued momentum and a stronger competitive position in our core credit products. Open Trading adoption rates are accelerating and this remains a key area of our investment focus. European results are improving and incoming European regulations will create new opportunities. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will be coming from the line of Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Can you hear me?
Rick McVey: We can now.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Good morning. So yes, you guys have this larger authorization for buybacks in place and the stock is at multi-month low. So just want to check back with you and see how you’re thinking. You kind of alluded to this in your comments that I guess am I right in interpreting those remarks to mean that the plan has kind of evolved from just offsetting dilutions to potentially getting more aggressive here?
Tony DeLise: Jillian, that’s exactly what this expansion is – why we’ve put it in place. You’re right that first $35 million when we announced it back at the beginning of the year we said it was to really offset the dilution cost from share grants. And we’ve been active. We’ve been in the market everyday buying against our 10b5-1 grid. And we have gotten questions at the time about whether we would expand that authorization. And clearly we had the capacity to do that. Board did that act in July. The expansion allows us to buy more shares when the stock price is lower. So the different way to be more aggressive when we think the share price is undervalued. Right now we believe we can execute on that program within our existing cash resources and free cash flow generation, but the timing of when we execute on that plan is largely dependent on where the share price goes. So it’s difficult to say exactly when will complete the plan. Right now, there is defined termination date of the plan of December 31, 2015 but again the timing of that will be dependent on the share price.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. But right now you feel like the share price is one at which you would want to buying back stocks, in excess of offsetting dilutions?
Tony DeLise: Jillian, we’ll set up a 10b5-1 grid. The grid will be established so that we’re more aggressive at lower share prices. The share prices sort of bounced around here lately, and we just envision us being more aggressive when we’re at $45 than when we’re at $55. It will be set up in that sort of grid.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the Tradeweb multi-dealer platform, I thought which is supposed to start in July. I actually haven’t seen any announcement about it commencing, but just wanted to get an idea for what you’re hearing from your clients and dealers. If you have a sense for, if this is going to be a similar trading model to yours, or if there is going to be kind of a different strategy and what your thoughts are on whether this is a competitive threat or not?
Rick McVey: Sure, happy to take that one. We don’t have anything outside of the media reports that are available to you and everyone else, but we are led to believe that they expect to launch in July as you say. We are not surprised at all that they are redoubling their efforts in credit given the growing size of the opportunity. And we respect them as a competitor. We’ve said all along that Tradeweb and Bloomberg both have the critical assets to be successful in electronic trading and fixed income, given the breadth of their network, the technology assets that they have and the resources that they have. So we very much respect Tradeweb in the space as a strong competitor. A couple of things. This is not new. Tradeweb has been in the corporate bond market in the U.S. since 2003 in various spurts with different protocols offered into the market. We anecdotally hear from clients and dealers that the intent is to be offering protocols that look different than ours, and we have heard two things about that. One is it may involve some streaming levels from large dealers for U.S. corporate bonds; and then two, they may offer some connectivity into the recently acquired retail pool of BondDesk. So much remains to be seen from Tradeweb. I think its wait and see from investor clients. We have not heard from them that they see anything or shattering in terms of anything new to the marketplace that we and others haven’t thought about, but we will learn more over the coming months or so as Tradeweb launches. And they have a full agenda, right. They have – obviously are still integrating and digesting the acquisition of BondDesk in the retail space. They recently launched their inter-dealer government bond platform to take on NASDAQ and ICAP in the IDB government bond space. They are like, all of us new entrants in the SEF space and trying to make sense of the SEF space and simultaneously taking on credits. So they have a full agenda. And I think our mantra here is the same as it’s always been, which is a competition is healthy for the market and we are highly confident that we are focused on in investing more in the credit space even in spite of our position, and continue to deliver new and innovative solutions to our clients. And I think as long as we do that, we feel very good about our competitive position.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. That’s really helpful. And then the final thing I want to go back to. So, am I right in thinking that essentially the reason you guys didn’t provide us with like July to-date market share figures is because it’s almost impossible for you to determine, I guess apples-to-apples figure because of this new 144A stuff that’s included into?
Rick McVey: I think there are host of reasons, Jillian. First of all, we have eight important trading days still left in July, but yes, there are more moving parts right now in mid-month than normal. One, because of the addition of 144A is to the FINRA reported TRACE volume. And we’d like to work with you and the other analysts to make sure that we’re reporting that in the best way possible at the end of July to make it easy for you to make prior year comparisons. The second thing is that we have the recently determined double counting that’s taking place in TRACE that we hope to learn more about through the month of July. And then thirdly, the month starts on an odd week with the July 4 with holiday trading activity for a couple of days leading into the fourth weekend. So for all those reasons, there are a lot of moving parts in the July market share estimates. What we would say is, and if you look apples and apples at the registered securities, there’s been reports you see high-grade numbers that are weaker in July so far, but that doesn’t come as any surprise to us given the July 4 holiday and some of the weaker days around that period. The other thing of note about July is last week was the first signs of volatility returning to the U.S. credit markets with a very active week in high-yield. And the high-yield index yields went up about 35 basis points in a week. There were significant outflows in ETS and in mutual funds active in high-yield. And as you can see from the TRACE data, there was a significant increase in high-yield trading volumes and an improvement in electronic market share. So it is a reminder that when we get better secondary trading conditions, it comes with higher overall market volume and higher electronic share.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Adams from Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill & Partners: Hi good morning, Rick. Good morning Tony.
Rick McVey: Hello Mike.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill & Partners: So to follow-up on that last question. Totally appreciate why you can’t really comment maybe on July market share, but could you give us a little color on the mix that you’ve been seeing on the trading platform this month in terms of dealer mix, trade size, the yield, the maturity, anything that would change pricing quarter to-date?
Tony DeLise: Mike, it’s Tony. When you look at month-to-date right now, there is nothing that’s mixed out. When we look at years to maturity, when we look at bid offer mix, other than what Rick just mentioned on the high-yield side where you did see a big shift in the bid offer mix and the high-yield side, but there is really nothing there in terms of trade size. And again it’s early in the quarter though, we’ve got 60 or 62 day quarter and we’re 14 days in. So a lot can happen over the balance of the quarter, but that’s far in July. Other than what Rick mentioned around high-yield activity, there is nothing that really sticks out right now.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill & Partners: Got it. Okay, thanks. And then touching on some of the new initiatives here and specifically the Open Trading, Rick. I know you touched on the 35% increase to volume in the quarter. I am just curious, I mean we’ve seen pretty nice steady growth over the past couple of years, and this is really the first quarter where you’ve sort of broken out with really impressive gains. In your mind, what’s driving that? Is it traction with your sales force or is it more environmental in nature?
Rick McVey: I think it’s a couple of things. The protocols are new and it takes a while for investor clients to change their trading behavior, embrace new ways of trading. And as we have mentioned in the past, the biggest thing that’s new is being at the receiving end of inquiries and leading with a price. And I think as the time goes on and they are seeing more and more trade opportunities on the system, they are putting more prices in and they are getting more trades completed. So that all looks very positive to us. The other big change that I see during the quarter that I highlighted in the prepared remarks is the involvement of dealers in Open Trading. And increasingly we’re seeing more dealers viewing Open Trading as potentially an asset to their trading business and not necessarily a threat. And everything we have built in Open Trading allows traditional dealers to intermediate these trades on behalf of their clients. And you do see even among large dealers, you saw the announcement yesterday from J.P. Morgan, even among large dealers, you see them starting to embrace agency trading in credit. And certainly that’s what this is all about. It’s a new tool for dealers to promote agency trading with their clients, and to clear and intermediate those trades on behalf of their clients. And that combined with a very favorable feedback we continue to get from investors on how important that this is to them and their future liquidity in the credit markets as they are grappling with massive regulatory changes among their dealer counterparts. That combination is driving the growth and it’s giving us a lot of confidence that we are on the right track with the Open Trading strategy.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill & Partners: That’s great color, Rick. Thank you. And shifting gears over to Europe. You’ve maintained all along that you expect Xtrakter to be accretive in the second half of this year, and now that we’re finally there, would you be willing to give us a little bit more detail maybe on the expected earnings accretion we can see in the coming quarters here?
Tony DeLise: Sure Mike. We’ve talked about Xtrakter and our Trax business over the last several quarters. And we look at the results to-date, it’s been about neutral to earnings since the acquisition. It’s probably mildly dilutive, a couple of pennies dilutive last year in 2013. It’s been neutral in the first half of the year. The margins that coming out of the Trax business are pretty consistent with the historical margins, so in that 10% to 15% range, but when we overlay the amortization of our deal cost that must be getting us to neutral at this point in time. We do expect in particular in the data sales side, we do expect some improvement in the second half of the year. We do expect Trax to be mildly accretive in the second half of the year. And that’s on the back of continued rollout of new data products. There is data products around market volume, historical data, some real-time data. And what you don’t see in the standalone Trax’s results is the effect on our trading business. And we’ve said all along that what we’re trying to do is drive more flow on to the trading platform. And you’re seeing some of that come through with this 30% or so increase in overall trading volumes from European clients. There is a big increase in Eurobond volumes as part of that. So we do expect some accretion in the second half of the year. And I’d say, the improvement would be sort of mild uptick from what you’re seeing and to be mildly accretive in the second half of the year. And Mike, just to put it in perspective, the revenues coming out of the Trax business, rough numbers were around $13 million first half of the year. So it’s not all of what you’re seeing in that infill and post-trade line but coming out of Europe it’s about 70% of that line item.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill & Partners: Great. And Tony since you brought it up, I know you made some tweaks to some of your trade protocols in Europe. I think it was in late June, allowing more dealers to participate on the RFQs returning liquid bonds. Any early insight into the volume or market share pickup just in the first month or so?
Tony DeLise: I think the expansion in investor choice on smaller trade sizes in Europe is one of the reasons that volumes have been up so far this year, but I also think we’re benefiting from a broader product offering, right. There are higher quality data products coming from both our trading business and the Trax business that we’re providing to dealer and investor clients in Europe. And there is a pretty good bouncing back [ph] the post-trade services and expansion of transaction reporting and trade matching. And we’re just three months away from the move to T+2 settlement in European fixed income, and that’s increasing demand for real-time trade matching. So I think the broader product offering is resonating with European clients, and it is driving the growth that we see in the trading business currently.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill & Partners: Got it. Great. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Good morning guys. Most of my questions have been asked, but I just want to get back to this concept of streaming pricing that Tradeweb is supposed to be providing. Just from a historical context, so any of your competitors to-date being able to do that who have not basically not been able to penetrate this market?
Rick McVey: The short answer is no. The ability to stream in credit is certainly growing, and we see that as the protocol of choice in the CDS index business on SEF. As you know as it gets much more complicated when you move further down the liquidity spectrum, and corporate bonds have always been a challenge to provide institutional liquidity and levels in a live or streaming environment. So we have many dealers streaming on MarketAxess but they tend to stream in very small trade sizes with wider bid offer, and that obviously is not what investors are looking for, because typically they are getting better pricing than that through a competitive RFQ process. So it’s far from us to say it can’t happen but we haven’t seen that protocol be successful in credit yet. And like I said, I don’t know enough about the Tradeweb strategy to comment and whether that’s going to be a big part of the offering or not. That’s just what we’re picking up from the media reports is that’s one of the things that they are talking to dealers and investors about promoting.
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Okay. I appreciate the color there. And just sticking with Tradeweb. Maybe at what point granted as so far you’ve built a franchise, this withstood a lot of competitors threat, but if this were to gain traction, at what point do you look at them – how are you judging them, maybe is it market share or is it more on their number of clients they sign up, like how are you benchmarking their success versus you?
Rick McVey: We’ve always felt that [indiscernible] important competitor in the space. Like I said we’ve been dealing with ebbs and flows of Tradeweb in credit for about 12 years now, so none of that has changed. With respect to the metrics, you’ve bring up a great point which is that Tradeweb does suggest that they promote transparency, but we don’t have a lot of transparency on their results. So it would be a great asset to all of you and to the market, if we did have more information on their trading volumes and market share trends and revenue models by product, but we don’t have that whether it’s their recorded rate space or the retail space or the SEF, like we’re starting to see more information on SEF, but it would be great to have more transparencies so that all of you would have a way to compare their progress relative to other important players in the space.
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Got it. I guess finally going back to Xtrakter. As this kind of takes off in the back half and into next year, will clients have the option to either maybe soft dollar versus license some of these products?
Rick McVey: You’re talking about the data product, Ashley?
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Yes. So like I am basically trying to get a sense of should we expect revenues to flow through non-commissioned or commissioned income? Will they have that option?
Rick McVey: We would expect a little bit of both.
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Okay.
Rick McVey: Certainly we are rewarding active trading clients with expanded data products in Europe. And I think we’re in the very early stages of developing and delivering products that are going to be valuable to dealers and investors. The region is suffering from a lack of transparency. We think we have a role to play in fixing that to improve liquidity in the overall European market. We love the fact that we’re in the mix with dealers investors making what we think are very sensible compromises about what data products we deliver, what goes out in real-time, what comes out on a lag basis, but there is a lot of valuable data that we have in Trax that can help dealers and investors understand the liquidity trends and trading trends in the European credit markets. So part of that we would expect to see coming through in growing trading activity from our clients, and part of it we would expect to see as data revenue.
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Got it. Thanks for taking all of my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: Good morning guys.
Rick McVey: Hello Patrick.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: I wanted to go back to the topic of the 144A securities. So I guess the first question there is you guys don’t currently facilitate trade in those securities, do you? And if not, I think you mentioned about this – is this an opportunity for you going forward now?
Tony DeLise: Patrick, we have always traded 144A securities. And let’s say in the high-grade space, when you look back over the past three plus years, in the past 3.5 years, it’s been fairly consistent around 6% to 8% of our volumes of our high-grade volume has been in the 144A space. So it isn’t zero. The comment we made in the prepared remarks about increasing sort of the addressable market or expanding the secondary market opportunity, when we look at least the July information. And again unfortunately we’re in the situation where TRACE is – where FINRA has not released any historical information. So our dataset is fairly limited, but if you look at the July month-to-date information, it’s about 14% increase in U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes with the inclusion of 144A. So the important message, we have been trading 144A. It’s been a very consistent part of our high-grade volume. Probably the more important takeaway just the size of the market opportunity is bigger. So when we sized up – for example we in the past, we’ve talked about what 1 percentage point increase in market share would be across our product set. We now look at high-grade and we think that that 1 percentage point increase in market share is a bigger number today. And with this limited dataset right now, for July it’s about 14% larger. Listen, Patrick, I wish we had the historical information we could recast this, we can give you what we all want in terms of share, we just do not have that information today.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: Got you. But basically it’s actually kind of making your market share more consistent right now, because your volumes are 144A and non-144A and now the denominator is going to be reflecting the same, right?
Tony DeLise: That’s correct. Exactly.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: Okay. And same story with high-yield. You guys are trading 144A high-yield instrument as well?
Tony DeLise: Again we’ve been trading 144A high-yield. And that one story is a little bit different in that the impact on the reported high-yield TRACE numbers is going to be bigger. At least what we’ve seen in July month-to-date, it could be a 60% increase in high-yield TRACE volumes. And we’ve been trading high-yield 144A just like we’ve been doing it for high-grade. It hasn’t been necessarily as consistent as a consistent portion of our high-yield business, but just to put it in perspective for this year-to-date, it’s probably about 20% of our high-yield volumes has been 144A. And again all things equal, the reported market share will go down, but we think the opportunity set is bigger, and in this case a lot bigger.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: Okay, got you. That’s helpful. And then I guess just touching the double counting issue. What’s the argument that some of the dealers are making, and why they are reporting these trades twice?
Rick McVey: We’re not privy to the decision that one or more of them have made on reporting, but Patrick we believe it has to do with back to back trades that are going to a non-U.S. legal entity that has not been reported twice previously and the decision was made in the second quarter to begin reporting both legs. We know through our conversations with FINRA that they are aware of this. They expect to take it up internally to make a decision on how they should address it going forward. So we would expect that somewhere around this time next quarter, we may have some guidance from FINRA on how to treat what is now these double reported trades.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: Got you. And then last one from me. So you guys talked about record high-yield in emerging market volumes this quarter. How much of that do you think is attributable to market share gains from you guys in those businesses versus relatively robust overall trading environment in those products?
Tony DeLise: Yes, it’s probably a little bit of both, Patrick. The best we can measure market share on the EM side, it looks like a little bit of an uptick and it looks like the velocity has picked up a little bit more in the EM side. In high-yield, when we look at the TRACE volumes and we look at market share, probably it’s small uptick in market share on that side. The bigger gains – on the record volumes, the bigger gain was on the emerging market side than the high-yield side. And that’s when we have less information or not as reliable information to judge the market share.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: All right, the after data that comes out about three months is too late?
Tony DeLise: Exactly right. Exactly.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: All right, got you guys. Thank you.
Rick McVey: Thanks Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Hi, good morning.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Hugh.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: So one question with regards to just some of the distribution fees you guys have talked about. I was wondering if you could provide some color. I think you mentioned a few hundred thousand dollars in distribution fees that you’d anticipate being incremental in the third quarter and how we should be thinking about the buckets there? And then color on kind of within the liquid product segment, noticing kind of an uptick in that fee, the distribution fees being a little over $200,000 versus normally seeing that closer to $50,000 for the quarter and what might be driving that?
Tony DeLise: Sure. Hugh on the – I’ll kind of take them piece by piece. On the U.S. high-grade distribution fees, we’ve got this one dealer who will migrate in July from an all variable plan to one of our fixed plan, one of our distribution fee plans. And so that one by itself will cause an increase in distribution fees. And as you know, all things being equal, that will cause us a little bit of a decrease in our fee capture. And we’ve talked about how that’s pretty consistent. It’s pretty neutral in terms of overall revenues, but it does cause a little bit of mix difference there. On that liquid product one, what’s in there now and the majority of what you see in that distribution fees, that’s what little we’re charging for CDS on our SEF is residing in that bucket. So it was less than $150,000 in the second quarter was CDS related. We’ve put it in that distribution fee line. It’s really dealers who are streaming prices into our SEF. We are charging them. And again it’s sort of a modest number. And all things being equal, we expect to see something similar like similar to the second quarter in the third quarter and going forward.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay. And I realize that the revenue on the U.S. high-grade is neutral with variable versus fixed rate. Can you just remind us again and how we should be thinking about the fixed rate portion from the step-up from the one dealer?
Tony DeLise: On the fixed rate side, it will be $0.5 million or more. And on the variable side, this one, given where our trading volumes are right now and all else being equal and you know there is lots of elements that go into the high-grade fee capture, but if it was solely this one item, this one dealer migration, you’d expect the fee capture to go down $5 or $6 per million. But again realizing there is lot to go into that fee capture number.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Yes, and I certainly understand. And just going back to kind of your discussion around in Slide 5 with seeing kind of a shift here in the prices back during the quarter and seeing that incremental rise, can you just talk about whether or not, is that a function of a kind of handful of larger dealers that are changing their processes and getting comfortable with putting back prices, or is it kind of disseminating more wildly across the platform that you’re seeing. Any color on that for the rise [ph]?
Rick McVey: What we’re encouraged by is that we’re not only getting an increase in prices back and trades and volumes, but the breadth of participants is much larger. And I mentioned the total firms involved have seen a significant jump in Q2 from 175 or so to 260. So it’s very broad based. And there are more and more sophisticated alerts built into the MarketAxess trading system that are allowing both dealers and investors to identify potential trade matching opportunities. And those alerts are starting to take hold, prompting investors and dealers to provide a price back on a trade where they may have a match. So we’re very encouraged to see the breadth of people and participants through Open Trading. There are all kinds of examples of where in the old world, market participants could not connect with each other and through Open Trading they can. And some examples are on the dealer side and some are on the investor side and we’re seeing healthy growth from both.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay. And the feedback you’re getting from clients about that change incentive in a willingness or comfort level to be able to provide back those prices and maybe trade on the alerts. Is it more of a function of just kind of now having it for several quarters and being more comfortable acting on it, or is it kind of advances in technology that you’re providing them with different protocols, any thoughts there on feedback?
Rick McVey: Yes, it’s a little bit of both, right. We have thousands of trade matching opportunities that are triggering thousands of alerts each day. And I think as investors look everyday at more alerts, let’s say you have a potential trade match, they are reengineering their trading process to be in a better position to respond opportunistically when they have a potential match. So I do think that the sophistication in the alerts and the integration that we have with order management systems is a big positive. And with that investors are starting to respond more regularly with leading with a price when they have a potential match.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay. And then the last question I had is given kind of that feedback you’re receiving, are there additional protocols that you guys are testing and considering rolling out in the coming quarters that would provide further advances, or do you think that the set of tools that you’ve provided is kind of sufficient at this point?
Rick McVey: Never sufficient, right. Credit is not a one-size-fits-all market. And our investment is broad based in terms of providing a menu of choices to meet the challenges that credit presents in terms of different liquidity in the securities in our market. If you look across the platform today from CDS through to cash, we have seven or eight different protocols up and running and we expect to continue to add to that. So there are certain enhancements that are available now that clients and dealers are just beginning to digest around things like RFQ add-ons, and we expect to be rolling them out in the second half of this year and beyond.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: And so do you view 2Q as kind of an inflection point and do you have any color into what you’re seeing with regards to month-to-date July, and whether or not we’re kind of seeing consistent levels from 2Q or growth there from thereafter?
Rick McVey: I don’t even know the answer to that. The two weeks in July in the long-term are really not that relevant, Hugh, especially since one week was the July 4 week. Are we encouraged not just by what we see, but the thousands of meetings that we have every month? We are. There is a major shift going on in market structure caused by the regulatory changes. And large investors are really concerned about what the regulations have done to constrain dealer balance sheets for market making, and they are looking to find new sources of liquidity and increase the number of counterparties that they have available to them. And part of the shift in the second quarter is dealers get involved in helping with that solution and getting more comfortable with the notion that part of this market going forward is going to have dealers operating as agent as well as principal. And so both the anecdotal feedback that we see in all the meetings that we have combined with the metrics that we have provided to you today do increase our confidence that we are well on our way being as a key solution to liquidity challenges in credit.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Great color, I really appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Niamh Alexander from KBW. Your line is open.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Hi, thanks. Just to finish up on this. Thanks for taking my questions and a solid quarter here too, congrats. The share repurchases, I guess it is very much a change from what we would have seen in the past. And just did I catch you correctly Tony, did you say it expires at the end of the year or it doesn’t have an expiry date?
Tony DeLise: No. With any sort of 10b5-1 program that you set up, you have to put an expiration date. And we can expand, we can extend, and this one we happen to take the view through December 31, 2015. And if we’re trading at $65, it’s going to take a longer time to act on that entire capacity under the program.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: So it’s just the program, the authorization doesn’t have an expiry date, but the program you’ve put in place expires on December 31?
Tony DeLise: That’s all it is, exactly.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay, fair enough. Thanks. And then I guess just on kind of the change in the strategy there with respect to the share repurchases. And in Europe, maybe if you could just help me understand, because part of the Open Trading initiative was maybe you stepping in and being the clearing broker if that’s what the client wants just as an intermediate solution until you kind of come across some other clearing brokers. Is there anything changing there? Have the clients kind of moved more towards using the dealers if they select reflecting dealers clearing broker or are you still kind of in that position there and you don’t feel the need now to continue to build the capital?
Rick McVey: Niamh in the short-term there hasn’t been much change. There are some large investors that are choosing larger financial firms to intermediate open trade than the MarketAxess system, and we would expect that to grow. We don’t believe that longer term we will be the clearer of choice for these trades. And as I mentioned earlier, we have offered all the dealers on the platform the opportunity to clear and intermediate these trades on behalf of their clients. So I think its early days to really say exactly how the clearing will be conducted for open trades. We have provided a straight through service to investor clients in the short-term that they value, but there is no reason why major dealers can’t offer that same straight through service to their clients and intermediate more of these trades going forward.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay, fair enough. I mean I thought that was maybe one of the reasons you were not distributing capital either way, something until now but it seems like some of the big clients are using some of the big dealers. Okay. And then I guess moving onto the CapEx, the pullback on the guidance and the expenses there. I think you’ve given some reasons there, Tony, with primarily kind of incentive comp-driven coming down and what not, but are the three initiatives that you’ve given us the color on to-date, is there anyone specific one there that maybe you’re pulling back on some of the spend like the SEF or something like that drives the lower CapEx as well as run rates?
Tony DeLise: Really not Niamh. When we had the first quarter call, we had guided towards that lower end of the range at the time. And we’re half way through the year now. Obviously we have a lot more visibility into the spend. And I mentioned a couple of specific items. So we’ve made a decision earlier this year around the data center consolidation. That does not impact what we’re doing around investing in Europe and Open Trading and CDS. So we did make a data center consolidation decision. That has an impact on ongoing run rate for software costs, hosting, capital expenditure spend. So it’s a pretty big impact on that one item. Even things around incentive compensation that I mentioned. When we’ve built our model, our budget for this year, I can’t say that we predicted the market conditions were going to be similar to what we’ve faced over the last six months. We had some different expectations built in. That’s a pretty big variable from where we were originally in terms of the guidance to where we are now. The other part, I want to just make sure it’s clear on, even though our salary, pure salary line is trending lower than the expectations, we are 100% on track with our year-end goals, our year-end employee headcount goal. And maybe the timing of when those new hires were on-boarded shifted out a little bit, but in no way have we deviated from those expectations. And today we’re sitting there with 318 odd employees at the end of the June. The expectation is by year-end we’re going to, depending on turnover, we will add to that number and we’ll end the year with 325 or 330 employees. And those additions we’re making are in all those key – surround those key initiatives. So we have not really deviated from that. I will say the second half of the year – the biggest variable in the second half of the year and where we come out on expenses, big variables where we come out on incentive compensations, where revenues are in the second half of the year. And the other ones that could bounce back and forth is just how successful we are with on-boarding new employees and where we are with employee turnover. But you see we’ve tightened up that range and we’re out in a different spots than where we were three months ago, but in no way do we feel like we’ve cut back the investments in the key growth areas, particularly Europe and Open Trading. Just one sort of side note on CDS. There is probably a little lower spend on CDS in the second half of the year than there was in the first half of the year. And we’re in a bit of a quiet period or sort of stasis period right now where legal fees will come down. We’ll probably be more disciplined around some expenses. So there will be slightly lower spend on that one.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay, that’s very helpful. Thanks Tony, I appreciate the color. And then just following up on earlier question lastly [ph], the central limit order book, do you have one in place. It’s just back to the kind of potential streaming prices. I am just wondering have you kind of reached out recently to see if there was more interest on the part of the dealers to stream prices. Is that something that your competitors are offering? I think it’s something you could offer too. Have you revisited that recently with some of the dealers and streaming some prices on there, or is it kind of more you see there is kind of list functionality in Open Trading and the alerts there is kind of much more captivating as potential for catching actually trades?
Rick McVey: We revisit protocols with dealers’ every day. We have a broad sales effort with the dealer community. We have a team that works with their trading desk every day. And we believe that our priorities in terms of protocols are determined based on the dealer input we get and the investor input. We do not see any broad based view among investors or dealers that a central limit order book for corporate bonds right now is likely to be a viable solution for the market given the fragmentation and the liquidity in the corporate bond market. There may come a day. I think that day will come from a combination of advances in market making technology, but importantly changes in issuer behavior that will lead to larger benchmark deals. And we have not yet seen a significant change in issuer behavior, but some level of standardization in the way that they issue bonds would certainly help secondary liquidity and would help move the market to something that could or at least the subset of corporate bonds operate in a more live environment. And we’re highly confident when the market is ready for that, we’re ready to provide the technology.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Wong from Morningstar. Your line is open.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Equity Research: Good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Michael.
Tony DeLise: Good morning.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Equity Research: The other fixed income transaction fee line has become more important. Do all of the factors that would affect U.S. high-grade pricing affect the other category, like duration of bond trading and larger trade sizes? And are there any other characteristics that are particular to the other fixed income type pricing that might trump [ph] the ones I just mentioned for U.S. high-grades?
Tony DeLise: Michael, it doesn’t have quite the same dynamics. So at least the way that these plans work today for the three principal products there which is high-yield, emerging markets and Eurobonds. Those bonds typically trade on price and we have just a pricing grid that we charge off of. It’s not dependent on duration, it’s not dependent on where years of maturity are, where yields are. So we don’t have those sorts of elements. The biggest challenge there is that this other credit is a amalgamation of a couple of products. And the single biggest factor causing shifts from period-to-period is the fact that one product might be growing faster or slower than other products. So it’s just a shift between the three products right now. So we don’t – at least today, we don’t have those same sorts of dynamics affecting the other credit piece.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Equity Research: And then I guess just in general for U.S. high-grade. I think you’ve mentioned before what the duration or years to maturity has been since the financial crisis, but do you see the duration of bonds traded on for U.S. high-grade on your platform decreasing much more from here?
Tony DeLise: For the last couple of quarters, we’ve been right around let’s say between 7.5 and 8 years. And that’s within our post-crisis range. So we look post-crisis over the last four or five years and the average years to maturity has been between 7.5 years and 10 years, and it does bubble around, but it’s been fairly consistent in the last several quarters. So that is a big influence. It’s something to keep an eye on when we talk about fee capture and how it’s moving around quarter-to-quarter. Duration in particular years to maturity tends to be a big influence, and it hasn’t – last couple of quarters, it hasn’t really moved all that much. It’s down a little bit from the one year ago level, but still within that post-crisis range.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Equity Research: And can you remind me if you’ve ever said what the years to maturity check on the platform was before the financial crisis?
Tony DeLise: We’ve probably haven’t talked about it recently, but I can tell you that in the sort of period immediately preceding, talking about 2006 and sort of midway through 2007, when we talk about sort of onset of the crisis it was when the floating rate note market dissipated in the second half of 2007. The years to maturity in our platform looked like 5.5 years or six years. It was much different environment back then. It was – the yield environment was different, the credit environment was different. The yield curve was a flat or an inverted yield curve at times. There is not a lot of trading at the long end of the curve. It’s different than what we see today, but yes it has been lower pre-crisis.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Equity Research: Okay. Thank you.
Rick McVey: Thanks Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks. I was just wondering what your CapEx was for the quarter?
Tony DeLise: Yes, it was – Jillian it’s a little bit more than $4 million. On year-to-date for CapEx, it’s a shade north of $9 million. And just on that one – I had mentioned in the prepared remarks that we had lowered the range for CapEx. It’s now $15 million to $17 million. It’s down a couple of million. It is solely and almost exclusively around the data center consolidation when we sort of bubble that through the forecast, that’s the reason for the decline.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time I am not showing any further questions.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. Enjoy the rest of your summer and we’ll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-04-23 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Dave Cresci - IR Rick McVey - Chairman & CEO Tony DeLise - CFO 
Analysts:  Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets Hugh Miller - Sidoti Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill & Partners Niamh Alexander - KBW Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James  
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded April 23, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses and then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2014 results. We announced earlier today a solid first quarter with revenues of $63 million up 18% and pretax income of 28 million up 12% year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.46 compared to $0.41 in the first quarter of 2013. Our growth was driven by continued momentum in trading volumes with record average daily volumes for both U.S. high grade and other credit products and an increase in U.S. high grade estimated market share to 13.4% compared to 12.3% a year ago. Volumes from European clients were up 36% during the quarter. We continued to invest actively in strategic initiatives that are designed to increase client participation on our trading network and develop new sources of liquidity for credit markets. Based on the first quarter results our Board has approved a $0.16 regular quarterly dividend. Slide 4, provides an update on market conditions. We were able to grow market share across products inspite of the challenging conditions in current secondary markets. During the first quarter investor demand for corporate bonds led to near record U.S. high grade new issuance. Strong demand is also reflected by the decline in credit spreads and yields during the quarter. Credit spreads are now back to pre-crisis lows. Credit spread volatility is also running at close to its lowest level of the past three years, investor demand for corporate bonds is currently focused on a new issue market. Secondary inventory of high grade and high yield corporate bonds among primary dealers currently represents approximately one day of secondary trading activity. Strong demand and limited secondary supply drives investor focus to new issues. This challenging market dynamic in the short term is also reflected in our hit rates, investor orders to sell bonds on MarketAxess currently resulted in trade 85% of the time but orders to buy bonds result in a trade just over 50% of the time. Lower overall hit rates versus the year ago period held back our market share gains. We believe the long term outlook for the secondary market is much more promising. High grade corporate debt outstanding is up over 60% since 2008. When market conditions have shifted in the recent past as they did last spring we have seen higher secondary turnover and higher electronic market share. Slide 5, provides information on our progress and open trading. We continue to focus on developing new open trading solutions to help dealers and investors operate effectively in the new credit market characterized by limited balance sheet capacity. This quarter we completed an important technology loop allowing dealers to be full participants in market list with the ability to both send and respond to inquiries. We have also delivered functionality that allows dealers and investors to trade with more than one counter-party or inquiry. RFQ add-ons allowed system participants to access liquidity in smaller trade sizes to work a transaction up to a larger size. Indications of interest have also been consolidated in a one page in order to more readily identify trade matching opportunities between dealers and investors. Orders available in our market list open order book continue to grow and system participation and trading volume in the order book reached a new record in the first quarter. Our open trading strategy is focused on providing a wide menu of valuable technology solutions to dealer, investor, clients to expand their range of potential counter-parties to improve secondary market liquidity and turnover. The wide range of trading solutions led to a record quarter in active investor firms trading on MarketAxess. Our volume growth this quarter was led by handful of strategically important large investors that have increased their engagement with the trading system. On the dealer side 8 of the Top 10 new issue underwriters were also Top 10 dealers on MarketAxess in Q1 we had 90 dealers in total making markets on the system. Slide 6, provides an update on Europe, we continue to make progress executing our European strategy to deliver a comprehensive offering for trade execution, data and post-trade services. We have improved the functionality on our platform and expanded our trading protocols to offer dealers and investors greater choice in how they trade. This led to a 36% increase in trading volume from European clients including an 80% increase in emerging market volume compared to the first quarter of last year. On the post-trade side we saw an 80% increase in regulatory transaction reporting activity and we’re seeing growing demand for additional post-trade services including trade matching. Momentum continues in sales of our existing data products and we’re excited about development of new value added products in the coming quarters. Our European client revenue now accounts for 20% of total company revenue and we remain optimistic about the synergies between the trading, post-trade and data businesses. Our technology platform migration for the post-trade services is on track and we continue to anticipate that Xtrakter will be accretive to earnings in the second half of this year. Now I would like to hand the call over to Tony for additional details on our volumes and financial results.
Tony DeLise:  Thank you Rick. Please turn to slide 7 for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were up 17% year-over-year to $187 billion, during a period when combined high grade and high yield trades volume was roughly flat. U.S. high grade volumes were $119 billion for the quarter up 18% from one year on a combination of the 110 basis point increase in estimated market share and a modest increase in high grade trades volume. Year-over-year market share gains were tempered by the decline in the offer side hit rate. Volumes in the other credit category were up 20% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Eurobonds, high yields and emerging market volumes were each up more than 17%. Investor order flow in the other category increased 32% year-over-year. Similar to high grade trading we experienced a challenging hit rate environment for high yield bonds in the first quarter of 2014. The CFTC made available for trade, mandate was effective for CDS indices at the end of February. Our CDS index volumes were up almost 200% sequentially to $19 billion and down 37% in the first quarter of 2013. Slide 8 displays the quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $63.4 million were up 18% from a year ago principally due to a 10% increase in trading commissions and the inclusion of a full quarter of Xtrakter results in 2014. Total expenses were $35.7 million up 23% in the first quarter of 2013, the expense increase also reflects the inclusion of a full quarter of Xtrakter expenses in 2014. On a pro forma basis assuming the Xtrakter results were consolidated for the entire first quarter of 2013 the total year-over-year expense increase would have been closer to 9%. Our diluted EPS was $0.46 compared to $0.41 one year ago. The effective tax rate was 37% for the first quarter. The full year 2014 effective tax rate is currently projected at the low end of the 2014 guidance range of 37% to 40%. On slide 9, we have laid out our commission revenues trading volumes and fees per million. The 10% year-over-year improvement in variable transaction fees was due to the 17% increase in trading volume offset by a 6% decline in overall fees per million. U.S. high grade fees per million were $167 in the first quarter compared to $184 in the fourth quarter of 2013. The combination of almost a one year decline in average years of maturity and a shift to larger trade sizes where we earned less under our tiered fee plan caused the decline. Post-crisis the average years for maturity of high grade bonds traded on our platform has ranged from a high approaching 10 years to a low of approximately 7.5 years. We dipped below eight years to maturity in the first quarter but we’re still within the post-crisis range. Realizing that there are many factors impacting high grade fee capture, in the near term we don’t foresee any significant change in absolute yield or the yield curve environment. Fees per million in the other credit category were $301 in the first quarter down from $321 in the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential change in fee capture and other credit was largely attributable to a trading shift amongst product categories. A 40% sequential growth in comparatively lower margin Eurobonds exceeded the growth in emerging markets and high yield trading volumes. Distribution fees was 16.2 million during the first quarter and consistent with the fourth quarter level. The year-over-year increase was principally due to several dealer migrations to the major U.S. high grade dealer plan in the second half of 2013. We currently aren’t tracking any dealer movements between our high grade fee plans. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. First quarter 2014 expenses of $35.7 million was flat versus the fourth quarter of 2013. The $1.8 million sequential increase in compensation and benefits was attributable to the seasonal nature of certain employee taxes and benefits, higher incentive compensation and an increase in head count. The level of professional and consulting fees tends to vary quarter-to-quarter. The $1 million sequential decline is due to lower technology and non-technology consulting cost and lower legal fees. A $900,000 decline in occupancy cost accounted for the majority of the sequential reduction in all other expenses. The fourth quarter occupancy costs reflected actions taken to consolidate office space in London, including a sublease loss and duplicate rent. Full year expenses are projected to be within our $150 million to $157 million guidance range but likely tracking at the lower end of that range. We haven't deviated from our year-end 2014 head count target but the timing of new hire on-boarding has extended out. We also recently made a decision to consolidate data centers which will result in savings and technology and communication cost and equipment spend versus our original 2014 budget. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information, cash and securities available for sale as of March 31 were $194 million compared to $200 million at year-end 2013. During the first quarter we paid out our year-end employee cash bonuses of roughly $22 million, a quarterly cash dividend of $6 million and capital expenditures of $4 million. We also initiated repurchases under our $35 million share buyback program in March. During the quarter we repurchased 54,000 shares at a total cost of approximately $3.4 million. There was no change in our capital structure during the quarter, we had no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks Tony. The foundation of the MarketAxess business continued to get stronger in the first quarter inspite of the current market environment headwinds. In addition to the record quarter and average daily volumes trade on this system we see optimistic signs that we’re developing valuable tools for the credit market of the future. Regulatory changes continue to drive the shift in credit market structure. Our growth in Europe during the quarter builds our confidence that we can grow our opportunity set and improve returns for our shareholders in the region. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question will be coming from the line of Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: If I annualize the current expense run rate -- I'm coming in even well below the low end of your guidance range and it you didn't change guidance but maybe if you could just walk us through how we get from here to that $150 million for the year. I don't know if it is all related to the hiring that you mentioned later in the year?
Tony DeLise : We did not put out any freshened up guidance and you’re right, in the prepared remarks we said we’re trending towards the lower end of that guidance range and you’re also right that we have to ramp up expenses from the first quarter level if it gets that $150 million or so and the two or three biggest expense changes would be around salaries and which is predicated on the hiring plan and as I mentioned we haven't deviated from the plan we set out several months ago which would have a hiring from this point forward, it could be an additional 10% increase in head count. We haven't deviated from that but realized the risk and variability in there. The other big variable quite frankly is around incentive compensation and that’s tied to operating performance so there isn't variability there. And the third piece of it which we do expect to ramp up is around depreciation and amortization and at year-end we had given some guidance, specific guidance on that where we were trending, we thought the range was between 18 million and 20 million. First quarter we were at 4 million, we think it is going to ramp up from that level and that one I feel more certain around the depreciation and amortization ramp up and probably more variability in the salaries line and the incentive compensation line.
Rick McVey: Remember too Jillian the first quarter only has approximately 1 month of Xtrakter expenses from the prior year period so we obviously are running at a different run-rate starting the year on Xtrakter expenses too. 
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And then on the all-to-all trading you guys put some impressive stats in there with respect to the use of market lists. And I was just hoping you might be able to give us an idea for what the actual open trading volume is. Like is it representing 1% of high-grade volume now for you guys, is it 3%, is that 5%? It is hard for me to gauge from the use of market lists what that's actually translating to in volume?
Tony DeLise: We have another sequential growth in open trading volume. We also as I mentioned before are pleased with what we’re seeing and the growing participation in terms of clients and dealers active in our open trading protocols, there is not a significant change in the percentage of volume coming from open trading so we are still running kind of between that 1% and 2% of volume level.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: And then just one other thing from me. On the high-grade C-rate, you mentioned that it had compressed for two reasons, the duration, which I am assuming is just related to a flatter yield curve. But then also the larger trade sizes and I guess this kind of goes also to the increase in the percentage of block trades that we have seen. I'm not sure what is driving that, I mean maybe it is just a fluke and it should shift back to the more normal rate I guess or is something going on that I am kind of missing there?
Rick McVey : I think there are a couple of things. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have seen really good progress during the quarter with some of our large focus accounts that we felt could have been using the system more actively and obviously those are the accounts that drive a significant percentage of the block trades in the secondary market. So I think that’s one piece of it, the second thing is we do often times see uptick’s in the percentage of block trades taking place in periods when the new issue calendar is very active and during the first quarter you can see that trend in both our data as well as the trades data.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Hugh Miller from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: So I guess in following up on the last question about some of the variable fee pricing, can you give us a little bit of color on as we take a look at the delta difference for U.S. high grade, how much of it is coming from duration versus trade size?
Tony DeLise: Sure, Hugh. Listen, first off, there is lots of items that impact that the fee capture and it's not only duration which is around years of maturity and yield but trade size even the dealer mix between the dealers on the all variable plan and on the distribution fee plan. So there are lots of factors in there but for the period from the fourth quarter to the first quarter that’s $14, that’s delta there, $17 delta was about evenly split between duration and that was mainly around the years of maturity and then the shift to the larger trade cycles.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: Okay. I guess as we look at block trading, it did uptick from what I'm seeing here about 43% of TRACE in the first quarter from 41% and change in the fourth quarter of last year. But is that what is really driving that on your platform with the uptick in size or is there something else that is going on with just a mix of client business or just people -- anything in particular that you are seeing that could be driving the size change?
Tony DeLise: I would just reiterate the point I made earlier, a lot of the volume growth in the first quarter was driven by five of our Tier 1 focused accounts that are getting a lot more active on the system and on average their trade size is larger than the overall investor group trading on MarketAxess.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: Okay, that is helpful. And then as we think about kind of the competitive environment within CDS index trading now that it has been live for a couple of months now and how competitive that environment has been, are you starting to change your strategy at all or your thoughts about ongoing investment for that product and how you are going to position the company?
Rick McVey: No, not really I think it has been a challenging start to the SEF mandate for all of us, the trading volumes in the industry going through SEF’s that are smaller than everyone anticipated and the current feed capture is significantly lower. So I don’t think you find anyone that would say that they are having a great time with the early days of SEF trading. Having said that it's far too early to know how this will shape up over the medium to long term. Beginning with exactly where the CFTC will go with their rules because we have a new Chairman and two new Commissioners is coming on board later in the second quarter. So we have been in this transition period with the regulatory which means that many SEFs are operating with different versions of the SEF rules right now and we need to see how that shakes out. I think when you look at it, we’re estimating that only 20% or 30% of the total index volume is being reported through SEFs right now. So there is more to come in terms of this SEF space, in terms of total market volume. In terms of how various competitor is shake out and exactly what the CFTC does in terms of enforcing the rules with the new commission in place. So as a result of all that uncertainty in the investments that we have made that we continue to feel good about, we continue to invest and focus on and CDS is one of our product areas.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: And then as we think about your commentary around share repurchase in the quarter, kind of implying average pricing is somewhere in the low $60 area, are you guys more inclined now to be more active with share repurchase given kind of some of the recent pressure on the stock or your thoughts around that?
Tony DeLise: On the share repurchases we had about this at year-end. We have put in place a $35 million repurchase plan. We know what the purpose was, was to offset the dilution from share grants and we really viewed the program we had in front of us more as a maintenance program and we have setup a 10b5-1, we’re in the market every day, we’re buying against that plan. We certainly have the capacity to act, if the opportunity presents itself you know we got a healthy cash position. Strong free cash flow generation, we got lots of borrowing capacity. If the opportunity presents itself, since the Board will be thoughtful around it and they will act accordingly but right now we’re acting on the program in front of us which again is more of a maintenance program.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: Okay, yes, certainly understood. Can you provide any color on kind of the rationale for some of the hiring delays, is it just a function of finding the right people or changes in kind of the operating conditions that are causing you to hold off on making the hire or any insight there would be helpful.
Tony DeLise: Yes it was more of the former. As it's always the case with hiring plans you got an aggressive outlook and you like to get those positions still as soon as possible. But in some of the markets we’re in, it has taken a little bit longer to get the position filled. So there are some business dependent positions but most of any sort of delays here hiring is just finding the right people and getting them situated in the position.
Rick McVey: And as Tony mentioned earlier we’re finding some additional expense synergies with Xtrakter and that’s an important part of the guidance that Tony provided earlier on the run-rate for expenses as well.  
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: And then the last question I had was just with regards to kind of market share for April. As we take a look at TRACE volume, it does appear that because it is likely the holiday timing that TRACE volume has been bit pressured year-over-year in April. But was wondering if you could provide us with some commentary around what you are seeing for share through the month as we see it now?
Rick McVey: Sure. Happy to do so. I think this month we have six full trading days remaining in the month following the holiday week last week but what we see so far it was very similar in April to the first quarter in all respects. TRACE volumes, market share, product mix et cetera there are not any significant changes in the first three weeks of the second quarter versus the first.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse: I just wanted to clarify the high-grade pricing dynamics this quarter. So on the fixed side, is the message here that this quarter is idiosyncratic and trends should pick up from here? Like asked another way, has the shift to large grade sizes from strategic clients and just a general shortening of duration continued into Q2?
Tony DeLise: So Rick just mentioned about the conditions in April being comparable for the first quarter. That is across trade size and product mix and dealer mix on high grade. So you can infer from that sort of comparability to the first quarter that so far in April and granted we’re less than one month into the quarter right now, we’re not seeing much difference in terms of fee capture.
Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse: And then on the noncommissioned side, you had decent growth this quarter so I just wanted to get some more color there, is this mainly due to more clients, launch of new products and could you actually parse out the contribution of Xtrakter in terms of revenues and expenses for us?
Tony DeLise: Yes, so on the Xtrakter side the revenue run-rate has picked on Xtrakter so when we turn the calendar into 2014 the revenue run-rate is up about 10% versus 2013 so the revenue run-rate has picked up and for the first quarter most of the delta, if you look at the earnings release there is a little more granularity in there, most of the delta in the information and post-trade services, it all came from Xtrakter and you do on a comparable basis for the first quarter of last year revenues were up about 4.4 million all of that was related to Xtrakter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Adams from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: So a question on the fee capture focusing more on the other product category, I think Tony, in your prepared remarks you mentioned like a 40% increase in the Eurobond volume. Now do you think that is connected to like gaining traction with Xtrakter so is that mix toward Eurobond volume, do you think that could increase as Xtrakter really takes hold here?
Tony DeLise: First thing I will talk about influences other credit category. From a fee capture standpoints and other credit it is dependent on the mix between EM, high-yield and Eurobonds and even to get more granular within emerging markets it depends on whether it's corporates versus sovereign. In high-yield, it depends on whether a bond trades on spreads or price, there are lots of influencing items in there. In this case when you look at it sequentially it really was because Eurobonds did outperform, we think some of that is around what we’re doing around data. Some of it's around what we’re doing around testing some new trading protocols as well. I don’t think we have seen the full effect of Xtrakter and embedding the trade, the data into our trading platform. I think a lot of that as Rick had mentioned a lot of that is underway right now and we probably haven't seen a big benefit of that today. 
Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Got it. And what was the percentage of high-yield EM volume of the other category?
Tony DeLise: It was almost identical to the first quarter of last year, it was right around 82% and that’s why the fee capture, if you look at the fee capture year-over-year in that other credit category did not vary widely. If you look at the mix it was about the same.
Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: And then maybe sticking with Xtrakter in Europe, I know one key date past sometime in February in terms of some of the trade reporting requirements in Europe. First, was that a revenue event for you? I know you are connected to CME's trade reporting facility. I am just curious if there is any discussions to maybe connect to ICE or DTCC or any other of the facilities that are available?
Rick McVey: I think you’re referring specifically to the swap reporting requirement and we’re providing that service but it's a tiny part of what we do overall with regulatory transaction reporting and tracks. So that in itself not material. The MiFID II bond transparency requirements we believe are still on track to take hold around the end of next year and we do see the markets preparing for those changes and part of our work on data is working with the market participants in Europe to begin building some new data products in anticipation of the MiFID II required dates in year and half or two years. So we think they are both discreet data revenue opportunities that will emerge over the second half of this year and we also think we will see improvements in the value that investors and dealers see in our trading system because of the integration of data and trading on the MarketAxess Europe system.
Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: And then one last one from me. Since the last earnings call that you hosted, we have seen a few small M&A deals and the acquirers were not traditional competitors of yours. There were a couple of exchange operators and more of an equity focused block trading platform. So maybe these smaller platforms weren't a major competitive threat in the past but as part of a bigger organization with greater financial resources and maybe it adds credibility. Do you expect any sort of change in the competitive dynamics and in your ability to maintain your dominant market share?
Rick McVey: We are not at all surprised as we said in the past I think the widely shared view is that electronic trading in credit will be much bigger over the next 3 to 5 years than it is today, so it's not at all surprising that many participants are looking for entry points into credit. The key theme is you point out that these deals were really small. These were relatively early stage companies and we’re a small company ourselves but when we compare the breadth of our network, the investments that we’re making and the system, the employee base it's very, very different and then the companies that were involved in M&A space and it's always the key for us is not this standstill and I think inspite of the lead that we have in U.S. electronic credit trading we’re still investing more by far than anyone else in new technology solutions to address the regulatory changes in the market. So our view is as long as we keep our investment budget healthy and we’re investing in the right solutions for our clients we have every reason to believe that we can maintain our leadership position.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Niamh Alexander from KBW. Your line is open.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: If I could just focus on a few industry questions, the company specific have been asked and answered. Rick, do you think we are going to get towards maybe some streaming prices in some of the more liquid bonds like we have had such huge volume of issuance in the last few years and some very, very big deals from some single companies. Are you starting to see kind of much more frequent trading in some of the bigger not more frequency trading but much more big -- much more frequent pricing and demand maybe getting towards CLOB [ph] type activity in some of the products?
Rick McVey: Gradually Niamh. We obviously are streaming, quotes are very common in the CDS index space where the markets are very liquid and trade on spread and very stable in this kind of environment. We see dealers developing streaming capabilities in bonds but using them primarily as indications for their clients now. You know really what investors continue to find is that they do get better pricing through competitive RFQ protocols currently than they do from streaming quotes. So the fragmentation in the market, the lack of continuous trading continues to be an obstacle for true streaming technology to work in the bond market in a fully live and executable way.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: If I could just go back to the company specific on the SEF because you have been investing in this -- I would say one of the more thought leaders in kind of how to structure these, working with the regulators for several years now and the SEFs have rolled out for indices, but we still haven't gotten the rules for the single name products from the SEC. And given how it is shaking out in the index, it seems like Bloomberg especially is running was some very, very low pricing. Is there a point where the benefits just don't outweigh the costs or it looks like the benefits don't outweigh the costs or do you think it is something that you cannot [technical difficulty]?
Rick McVey: Well I think that I made the point earlier that it's far too early to know. The cost for all SEFs are high which is why I don’t think the current dynamic can support 21 SEFs. So, I do think you’re going to see fair fewer SEFs in the industry over the next year. But we have got a lot to learn about volume going through SEFs in the aggregate, trading protocols that will be permissible by the commission longer term. Client and dealer demand for different protocols, so yes in the very short term Niamh, our costs are clearly greater than our revenues. I would guess that that’s the case for all 21 SEFs including the leader that you mentioned. So that’s not likely to persist but it's way too early, we think to make any final determinations of where we think we will be in the CDS SEF space.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: Rick. Just lastly on Xtrakter, I guess it is Company specific, but the market data tape, you already said we expect Xtrakter to be accretive in the second half of this year and it looks like you are kind of coming in better than expected on the cost. But can you give me a little bit more specific information. You were working with some of the big dealers on kind of rolling out a more limited data tape. The rules may not require people to have a tape or whatnot until the end of next year but once it becomes available, I think it is hard not to have it. So this is something that you think you could actually start rolling out and have an effect in the second half of this year?
Rick McVey: We will definitely have new data products out during the course of this year and the starting point in Europe as well because there hasn’t been a lot of transparency in the European market and there is a subset of the transactional data that’s not terribly controversial around more liquid bonds that trade very frequently where dealers and investors would agree that it's likely that data is positive for the market and doesn’t cause any great anxiety in terms of going deeper into less liquid bonds. So we’re working on those solutions and we’re working with our dealer, investor, clients on rules around trade transparency and we’re excited about what we can do to lead that charge.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: So my first question is just kind of dwell a little bit deeper on the offer wanted hit rates issue. If we look at slide four, I think it is the chart on the lower left where you look at dealer corporate bond balance sheets. It looks like those balance sheets have been roughly flat for the last few quarters and yet over that period, we have seen that deterioration in your offer wanted hit rates. So is there something else going on with dealers besides balance sheet constraints that is pressuring those hit rates?
Rick McVey: I would point less to the dealer side and more to investor demand. I think when you look at the combination of the new issue activity and the fact that those order books are consistently oversubscribed and the significant compression and credit spread is taking place. Really what’s happening is that investor demand is far greater than the existing level of supply even inspite of the very high levels of new issuance.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: I was looking at industry wide volumes, can you just update us what is your view on trading velocity, what sort of dynamics do you see that are out there that might increase corporate bond trading velocity over the next three years?
Rick McVey: It's a variety of factors there but we have to believe that a market that’s now 60% larger in debt outstanding is going to lead to greater secondary activity. When the market conditions are more favorable but the same slide that you’re referring to when credit spreads have returned to all time historical lows and volatility is generally low it does not lead to a lot of secondary trading turnover and I think that the conditions that we saw last spring were credit spreads started to widen and volatility was greater so there were more trading opportunities in the market, were a precursor to what we will see at some point in the future.  When we get higher spreads and higher spreads volatility turnover of what is now a much larger base of corporate debt, we believe will be higher and I think that’s also why it's critical that the industry continues to develop new sources of liquidity because the model that we think is likely to work in that environment in the future is not the same one that has worked in the past given the balance sheet constraints that the large dealers are now faced with.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Wong from Morningstar Equity Research. Your line is open.
Michael Wong - Morningstar Equity Research: So primary dealer holdings picked up over the last year but are still down significantly from their peak. So are the large dealers as active on the platform as they used to be despite the lower inventory or balance sheet compared to few [ph] prices?
Rick McVey : Yes the short answer is yes. If you look at the high grade high yield inventory it's roughly flat, so that’s not really where the growth in primary yield holdings is coming from. Actually the split between major dealers and dealers that are on the high -- the all variable plan has been fairly steady over the last few quarters a little over 70% of the trades with the major dealer fee plan. But within the story of dealers within our major dealer plan we see very good signs with some of the largest underwriters and largest secondary trading firms are increasing their market share on MarketAxess. So we believe that that is also a very healthy trend and a very healthy signs for the future.
Michael Wong - Morningstar Equity Research: I was just wondering if you could quantify the current drag on earnings from operating just currently unprofitable SEFs?
Tony DeLise: We did provide some color in the 10-K that was filed in early March around the financial resource requirement for the SEF itself and the way that CFTC rules work you have to maintain on a forward-looking basis, you’ve to maintain 12 months of operating expenses in terms of your financial resources. If you look in the 10-K you will see some disclosure which says that our financial resource requirement is approximately $6 million and what that tells you is that’s about the operating run-rate and from a revenue standpoint while we did start charging our participants in March it's just not a significant amount in terms of the revenue numbers. So think about that $6 million as a nut, you tax effect that and you can figure out it's more than few pennies per share. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Adams from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
Mike Adams - Sandler O'Neill: Actually my follow-up was answered. I couldn't figure out how to remove myself from the queue. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question will be coming from the line of Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets.
Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets: I know that the CDS revenue isn't material for now but I am just curious where it is showing up in the income statement if it does become hopefully more material over time?
Rick McVey: Jillian it's a very small amount for the first quarter, if it does become material we will have to sort of debate internally where we’re going to set it up. We may end up breaking it out separately into a separate category only because the volumes and fee capture would probably distort any of the existing category. So if it does become something material you will probably see it separately.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time I’m not showing any further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference call. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-01-29 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Dave Cresci – IR Manager Rick McVey – Chairman and CEO Tony DeLise – CFO
Analysts:  Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse Jillian Miller – BMO Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James Hugh Miller – Sidoti Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill Niamh Alexander – KBW Michael Wong – Morningstar Research 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 29, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses; and then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenues of $60 million up 24% from the prior year. Pre-tax income for the quarter increased 12% to $25 million and diluted EPS was $0.41 up from an adjusted $0.38 a year ago. Organic growth was driven primarily by increasing market share and market volumes in our core products. U.S. tax rate volume, were up 15% from the prior year quarter. Expenses were up 35% to $36 million reflecting ongoing investments in our organic growth and the impact of the Xtrakter Acquisition. During the fourth quarter, we also reported an accounting gain of $7.6 million or $0.20 per share on the sale of Greenline. We saw growing momentum through the year in our open trading initiatives with increased client and dealer participation and the development of new functionality to facilitate all-to-all trading. Slide 4, highlights our continued strong growth rates. Annual growth rates were volumes, revenues and EPS in 2013, were in line with our strong long-term averages with variable transaction revenues and EPS rose up 24% in 2013 compared to 2012 and total revenues up 16%. Record transaction revenues for the year were driven by market share gains and record volumes across our core products, high-grade, high-yield in emerging markets. Total full-year trading volume of $694 billion was up 18% over 2012. U.S. high-grade estimated share for the year was 13.8% up from 12.4%. High-yield trading was our highest growth area with estimated market share up more than 200 basis points year-over-year, the 5.2% in 2013. While no regulatory tape exists for EM, based on available information from EM-Tape, we estimate that our market share of the EM external debt market also increased by approximately 1 percentage point year-over-year. Based upon these results, our board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share. In addition, our board approved a $35 million share repurchase plan primarily to offset dilution from stock compensation. Slide 5, provides an update on market conditions. Combined U.S. high-grade and high-yield TRACE volumes for 2013 were up just 5% compared to the prior year. Corporate debt outstanding continued to grow at an, healthy pace on the back of record new issuance. 10-year treasury, yields rose steadily throughout the year reaching 3% in the fourth quarter, to the highest levels into the second quarter of 2011. Meanwhile, credit spreads tightened significantly towards the latter part of the year, and despite continued outposts from taxable bond funds, demand for credit bonds outstrips supply. Their current secondary trading environment featuring strong demand and low dealer inventory creates challenges for investors speaking to add bonds to their portfolios. Primary dealer holdings of high-grade and high-yield bonds picked up modestly. At the end of the year remained depressed compared to historical levels ending the year at $21 billion or slightly more than one day of TRACE volume. With the incoming regulatory capital requirements, we believe that pressure on primary dealer balance sheets will continue, reinforcing the need for new liquidity solutions in the market. Slide 6, provides information on our progress in open trading. Our high-grade market share gains were more modest in the fourth quarter than long-term averages. While bid wanted hit rates were healthy at 85%, offer wanted hit rates declined due to the supply-demand imbalance. Market turnover of outstanding corporate debt remains almost equivalent to the lowest change during the credit crises of 2008, reflecting the ongoing liquidity challenge in the bond markets. If U.S. high-grade bond turnover returned to a long-term average of around one-time per year, TRACE volume would be almost 50% higher than 2013 levels. We continue to believe that connecting our dealer and investor participants through a range of innovative trading protocols will help to improve overall liquidity and turnover in credit products. In the fourth quarter, 75% of investor increased, were sent to the market list open order book compared to 40% in the prior year quarter. Over the course of 2013, over $600 billion in live orders were available on market list resulting in over 14,000 open trades among system participants. Region open trading enhancements expand market-list for dealer initiated in, an offer-list orders, improve order matching alerts to system participants and add protocols designed to address larger trade sizes. With three trading days remaining in January, we currently expect high-grade market share to be modestly below the fourth quarter average and well above last January. Slide 7 provides an update on SEF-regulations. Since the implementation of SEF rules in early October for permitted transactions, the industry has seen a rapid decline in the electronic trading of swaps. We currently estimate that less than 10% of CDS index trading is taking place on SEF. Electronic CDS volume on MarketAxess was up over 100% in the first three quarters of 2013 versus the prior year that fell 80% after SEF rules were implemented in October. The highly prescriptive CFTC SEF rules bringing documentation, counterparty credit, trade execution and curling challenges for industry participants. As a result, most swap trading is currently conducted away from SEF in the short term. The CFTC made available in trade determinations have been finalized for on the run CDS industries and mandated SEF trading will begin in late February. At that time map CDS index below the block trading thresholds will be required to trade on SEF’s resident permitted to trade on SEFs. We estimate that approximately 75% of CDS index trades and 50% of CDS index volume will fall below the block trading exemption and will be subject to SEF trading requirements. So, I need to provide an update on Europe. We continue to make progress with our European strategy to develop a comprehensive solution for trade execution, data and post trade services. In the last couple of months, we have started to see the impact of renewed client engagement with a 30% increase in trading volumes from European clients in December and January compared to the same period a year earlier. We are further expanding our suite of data products to enhance transparency in European fixed income markets consistent with the upcoming MiFID II regulatory requirements. We are also investing in broad transaction reporting services for dealers and investors in order to comply with upcoming MiFID II and near regulations. We expect Xtrakter’s business to be accretive to earnings beginning in the second half of 2014, as our investments in technology and new product development begin to drive an increase in revenues and operating margins. Now, I would like to hand the call over to Tony, for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 9 for a summary of trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were up 15% year-over-year to $171 billion. U.S. high-grade volumes were $106 billion for the quarter, also up 15% year-over-year. Lower offer-wanted hit rates coupled with order flow favoring the offer side combined to reduce our market share gains in the fourth quarter. Volumes in the other credit category were up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Year-over-year market share gains and high-yields were the primary driver of the others credit category improvement. Slide 10 displays our quarterly earnings performance from continuing operations. Revenues of $60.4 million were up 24% from a year ago, principally due to a 14% increase in trading commissions and the inclusion of extractors post acquisition results. Total expenses were $35.7 million up 35% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the Xtrakter operating expenses, total expenses were up 9% year-over-year and reflect the ongoing investments in people and technology to support open trading CDS and other initiatives. Our diluted EPS was $0.41 compared to an adjusted $0.38 per share one year ago. For comparative purposes, the fourth quarter of 2012 tax provision has been adjusted to exclude a non-recurring favorable income-tax adjustment of $66.7 million or $0.18 per share related to certain acquired tax loss carry-forwards. On slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees for million. The 15% year-over-year improvement in variable transaction fees was due entirely to the increase in overall trading volume. U.S. high-grades fees per million were $184 in the fourth quarter down $8 per million from the third quarter. As mentioned on the third quarter earning call, one dealer migrated from the all variable high-grade plans to the major plans during the third quarter and a second dealer followed the same path on October 1. As a reminder, dealer move misdirection typically results in an increase in distribution fees and an offsetting decrease in variable transaction fees. At current volume levels, a single dealer migration impacts fees per million by roughly $5. Fees per million in the other credit category were $321 in the fourth quarter up from $291 a year ago and from $317 in the third quarter. The year-over-year improvement is due to trading mix favoring high-yield volumes. Similar to the third quarter, emerging market and high-yield volume accounted for approximately 85% of the other credit category volumes. Distribution fees were $16.1 million during the fourth quarter. We currently expect that first quarter 2014 distribution fees would be similar to the fourth quarter level. Slide 12, provides you with the expense details. Fourth quarter 2013 expenses were $35.6 million up 3% sequentially from the third quarter. The fourth quarter and full year 2013 expenses were right at the mid-point of the updated guidance we provided on the third quarter earnings call. The sequential decline in employee compensation and benefits is almost entirely due to lower variable expensive compensation. And the sequential increase in depreciation and amortization is largely attributable to our replacement primary production datacenter coming online late in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we consolidated office space in London, and sub-let the legacy market access location. Fourth quarter 2013 expenses include a loss on the sublease and duplicate rent totaling approximately $600,000. On slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available for sale at the December 31, were $200 million compared to $180 million at year-end 2012. During 2013, we expanded approximately $38 million to acquire Xtrakter, a cash dividend totaling $20 million and spent $23 million on capital expenditures. Cash flow from operating activities generated during 2013 was $91 million were more than sufficient to cover the investment and capital return. There was no change in our capital structure during the fourth quarter, we have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. On slide 14, we summarize our capital management activities. Our recurring quarterly dividend remains an active part of our capital management priorities. With the announced increase to $0.16 per share, we’ve now increased the quarterly dividend in four consecutive years. We’ve also increased our investment in open trading, CDS data and other organic initiatives including several new datacenter build-outs. We expect these investments to help drive future revenue growth. Today we also announced the $35 million share repurchase program. Since the date of our last major repurchase in connection with the JPMorgan secondary offering in February 2012, our diluted share count has increased by almost 700,000 shares. The purpose of this new program will primarily be to offset the increase in our diluted share count principally resulting from annual equity grants. We expect the program to live later in the first quarter. We remain focused on capital management and investment in organic initiatives through our existing cash position, strong cash flow generation in line with credit borrowing capacity, we have the flexibility to meet our capital management’s investing priorities. On slide 15, we have laid out our 2014 expense, capital expenditure and income tax rate guidance. We expect that total 2014 expenses will be in the range of $150 million to $157 million. The mid-point in that range suggests an approximate 9% increase in expenses over the second half of 2013 run-rate. Employee compensation and benefit costs are expected to represent a little over 50% of total expenses, consistent with the trend over the past several years. The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the higher level of capital expenditures in 2013 and 2014. We expect another heavy year of investment in 2014 and estimate the capital expenditures will be between $17 million and $20 million, was about evenly between software developments and IT related equipment and software. We expect the effective tax rate for full year 2014 will be between 37% and 40%. After adjusting for one-time items, the effective tax rate in both 2012 and 2013 was approximately 38%. Among other items, the mix of U.S. and foreign source income and change in tax rate could cause variations in the effective tax rate. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks Tony. 2013 was another strong year of growth for our core business in high-grade, high-yield and EM. Our dealer and investor clients continue to embrace electronic trading for a growing percentage of their credit trading activity. Regulatory changes create new opportunities for open trading, transaction reporting, CDS and data products. We are pleased with our progress to expand our service offering in these large and important areas for our clients. The combination of market driven demand and regulatory change creates an attractive environment for growth for the company. And we are excited about the opportunities they had in 2014 and beyond. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Good morning. Rick, it feels like two of the key hurdles for further buy side engagement in all-to-all trading are, maybe obtaining a reliable reference prices to price bonds and then compliances is designed for price takers. So I was hoping you could share some color on, your current real-time conversations with clients here. And also, your thoughts on the timelines for these two elements to involve?
Rick McVey: Sure, thanks Ashley and good morning. Absolutely, real-time price data is a core ingredient of moving toward a more open architecture. And they are moved by regulators to promote transparency certainly helps with the trades tape here in the U.S. and the method two consolidated tape planned in a couple of years. So there is more a transaction data out there and then you see analytical services and companies continuing to add pricing capabilities in real-time to expand beyond the set of reported bonds. And we are working with ITC and importing prices from other service providers to help investors with that task. And we will continue to do so until those analytical capabilities continued to advance. I think your second question relates to best execution requirements. And you’re right to point out that many of the investor best execution guidelines are antiquated from moving into an environment of all-to-all trading. Because in many cases the guidelines reflects getting three or more dealer prices. And we do see some movement in that and by the way this is not an SEC restriction, the SEC provides plenty of room for investor judgment on best execution. It’s just the default that many investors have used in the past. So, we do see some progress there with investors using independent pricing from other sources as a means of demonstrating best execution. And I don’t think that that will be well, a meaningful obstacle in the progress on open trading.
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks for all the color there. And I guess, maybe switching to expenses, I thought it was like a meaningful ramp-up this year. And maybe if you could share some color on the revenue side, I presume Xtrakter will play a key role there. So, any color on what’s more hang-through, it was more aspirational. And just you’re thinking about the revenue side of the equation in general? We appreciate it. Thank you.
Rick McVey: And that specific to Xtrakter assay?
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Yes, Xtrakter and otherwise as well?
Rick McVey: Yes. So, with respect to Xtrakter, no real change there in the strategy and the growth expectations. The revenue growth really we think comes from two primary areas. One, continuing to develop and distribute high quality data products. And we have been working both internally to develop those products as well as with our dealer investor clients to make sure that we’re promoting volume and price information in a way that it’s constructive to the market and helpful to liquidity. And the other area is continuing to expand our post trade services and especially around transaction reporting and trade matching. And the transaction reporting requirement in the past has been limited to the dealer community. It’s now moving out to the investment management industry. And we are expanding our services to be able to help those clients with transaction reporting. And we also see more opportunities to use the data we have within Xtrakter to promote real-time trade matching. So those three main areas really drive most of what we expect in the revenue increase that lead to the comments that we made earlier about our hope that Xtrakter will be accretive to earnings in the second half of this year. And all of that is consistent, we also think with our core mission of also developing a broader electronic trading market in Europe.
Ashley Serrao – Credit Suisse: Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jillian Miller from BMO. Please go ahead.
Jillian Miller – BMO: Thanks guys. Sticking with the Europe topic, I think you mentioned that the training was up like 30% year-on-year in January. And I was just wondering how much of that is related to share gains because of some of this other data versus just general market strength?
Rick McVey: Jillian, it’s – we don’t think it’s on those volume improvements are coming on the back of increase in trading and overall market trading volumes. We do have some increased visibility on trading volumes coming out of Europe and we think it’s probably half of the trading volumes we see here in terms of high-grade trade volume. So we don’t think it’s on the back of the improved overall market volumes. And Rick’s comments were sort of a combination of both December and January, so, what’s interest for the one-month period. And just important to note when, when we talk about volumes coming from our European clients, it’s not just euro bond volumes, our European clients are very active in emerging market high-grade in particular. So they are – those volume improvements are across multiple products including what we consider North American credit trading product.
Jillian Miller – BMO: Okay, got it. So, it’s not euro bonds that are 30% trading from European clients as of 30%?
Rick McVey: Correct.
Jillian Miller – BMO: Okay, got it. And now I just want to confirm, the U.S. high-grade, investment-grade compression. And I’m interpreting your comments right, that that was related to the dealer migration to that new plan versus anything going on with the yield curve or other factors?
Rick McVey: Yes. So, Jillian, yes, if you look at sequential quarters, third quarter to the fourth quarter, it is almost 100% of that variance that $8 per million was the migration of the dealers. And mention that prepared remarks when we have also you can see, one dealer migrating in the direction that happened which was going from the all variable plans for the fixed plan, it’s roughly $5 per million in variable fees, neutral to overall revenues with $5 per million in variable fees.
Jillian Miller – BMO: Right.
Rick McVey: It’s beyond – it’s a little more complicated when you get the comparisons from the fourth quarter of last year 2012 to fourth quarter of 2013, there is lot more noise in there. We have the dealer migrations would have been a negative to speak after. But we had interest rates rising, all things equal, that’s a negative. We have longer duration which would have been positive. And also another positive, this is year-over-year again, our dealers on the all-variable plan they continue to win more trade. So that’s a little more complicated year-over-year. It’s easier to explain sequential third quarter to fourth quarter.
Jillian Miller – BMO: Okay, got it. And then, on capital, in the demand, I guess that you guys want to hold on the balance sheet kind of in flux at the moment from what I understand just because you’re acting more often as restless principle on the all-to-all transactions. So maybe you can fill us on kind of what your plans are there, like how much cash – do you like you need the whole based on what you’re doing currently. And then, if you’ve made any decisions with respect to whether you’ll look to outsource that kind of little manned position to dealers eventually or is it’s something you think you can monetize and want to keep doing?
Rick McVey: Yes, on the first question we’re very comfortable with our capital position even with the return of capital that we’ve outlined this morning and the increased dividend and the new share repurchase plan. So, we are in very good shape for the kind of business and the amount of business that we’re clearing. And it should be for the foreseeable future. We’re really like most things taking our lead from clients in terms of how they would like to clear open trades. And we have a variety of solutions available to them, both through us and also through traditional counter parties. So, it’s difficult to predict how that will play out during the coming year or two. But right now we’re very comfortable with our balance sheet position given the amount of clearing that we expect to do.
Jillian Miller – BMO: Okay. And then, just one final numbers question. The loss from the sublease, is that like a one-time thing or should we expect occupancy expense to stay elevated?
Tony DeLise: Yes. But Jillian that loss on the sublease and the duplicate rent element of it as well. If those are one-time. So we exited the legacy MarketAxess space, we exited some Europe facility that Xtrakter was occupying. We leased new office space. We moved in right in the middle of the fourth. That sublease is a one-time charge.
Jillian Miller – BMO: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Patrick O’Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: Hi, good morning guys.
Rick McVey: Hello Patrick.
Tony DeLise: Hello Patrick.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: So, my first question is, obviously one of your better growth stories has been high-yield corporate bonds. And I’m looking at the industry-wide volumes in high-yield. And it’s been pretty lackluster even though we’ve seen investment grade really bounce back so far in January, high-yield really hasn’t. So, can you talk about the industry dynamics that are taking place with high-yields such that trading volumes there just aren’t as robust as what we’ve seen over the past year?
Rick McVey: Yes. When you look at the combination of high-grade and high-yield, you might get a better read Patrick. And that’s where I mentioned earlier in the call, for the full year in 2013, the combined volume was up about 5% or so. But part of the reason is to upgrade, where certain large high-yield issuers have now moved up to investment grade. So that’s a piece of this story. But I do think that you’re seeing a slight increase overall in TRACE volumes when you look across the two product areas.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: Okay. That’s fair. And then, moving on to CDS, so, couple of days ago, intercontinental exchange kind of put out a press release about a CDS trading platform that they’re going to have and they’re going to have three dealers I believe streaming quotes. Can you talk about just – how do you feel about the liquidity providers to your CDS offering and how you think that – what you are going to offer is going to stack up to some of the other ventures that are out there?
Rick McVey: Sure. I think developments in the electronic CDS market continue and different approaches and different models are out there as you would expect. I could be wrong but I don’t think the recent announcement necessarily so they had three dealers streaming quotes. I think they said three dealers participating. And one of those dealers talked about their role as agent for bringing clients on to the platform as opposed to principle for market making. So, we’re – we’re really pleased with the progress that we’ve made on our own central and middle order book. And we have a great partner to begin with in Barclays, who continues to expand the markets that they make on the platform and is on-boarding more and more end clients each month. And we and Barclays both remain open minded about expanding the platform with more investors and more dealers at the right time. But we’re very pleased with the progress that we’re making on the platform. And obviously one of the big benefits that we have is all the buy-side connectivity that already exists here.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: Okay, great. That’s helpful. Thanks. And then, last question from me. So as we’re talking about Xtrakter and becoming accretive in the back half of this year. Does that imply that you’ve already begun the sales process for some of these Xtrakter products that you’re going to be rolling out, presumably the sales cycle there is going to be at least a few quarters right?
Tony DeLise: Yes, it will be Patrick. And Rick had mentioned in his remarks that we are active out there, we are rolling out new products. We’re in front of clients right now. And I suppose on the data side and on some of the new trade reporting services. And just the other side of the equation on the margin side or incremental to margins is the expense side. And we’re pretty much there in terms of ramping up, the ramp up we experienced in 2013 and in the Xtrakter related expenses. If you looked at the expenses for the fourth quarter there was some comment in the earnings release around fourth quarter Xtrakter expenses. That’s probably pretty representative of the expense run-rate for Xtrakter in 2014. So, the combination of expenses leveling off then, we’re – as we ramp up on the revenue side on the data and both the trade reporting side, that’s when we can get through this accretive situation in the second half of 2014. And there is one other element to bear in mind, when we talk about accretion, we’re also absorbing the amortization of intangible assets created on the acquisition. So when you go through purchase accounting, you allocate the purchase price, the very fact that you’re acquiring one of the elements or intangible asset. That’s sort of overhead or overhang for the amortization of intangibles was about $2.5 million. So, we’re including that when we say that we expect the Xtrakter to be accretive beginning in the second half of the year.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James: All right. Got you. That’s very helpful. Thank you guys.
Rick McVey: Thanks Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hugh Miller from Sidoti. Please go ahead.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Hi, good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Hugh.
Tony DeLise: Good morning, Hugh.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: So, I guess, I had a question following up on the CDS trading opportunity and those questions that you’ve previously answered. Given how close we are against to the commencing of that trading. Can you just talk about what you guys are kind of expecting with regards to the pricing and anything you’re hearing on the pricing competition side? And then, as we think about the single-name trading aspect in that opportunity, is there anything more that you’re hearing out of the SEC about making some headway there on rules?
Rick McVey: Sure. I think it’s still an open question. I can tell you first hand. And I’m sure every other staff would say the same thing. The expenses are very real. So, one would expect that as we get through the finalization of the rules that there would be sensible pricing in revenue models that begin to emerge in assessed phase. And we would expect at the beginning into the second quarter, we would have a modest revenue event from our CDS index activities. So, as you think we’ll probably see some changes around pricing coming up in the next several months. I’m sorry, the second question Hugh was?
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Just with regards to the SEC and progress with single-name trading and rules there and your expectations as we look at 2014?
Rick McVey: We really haven’t heard anything at all from the SEC with respect to their time table on single names. They obviously have a full plate, we’re not aware of anything that has been publicly stated by the SEC in terms of when they would expect to get to their rules. So our plan for 2014 is really about building out the organic single-name CDS trading platforms. And we do not expect to have any significant regulatory change throughout this year.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay, all right. And as you talk about the expense guidance that you’ve given out, I guess, at the mid-point coming in to touch higher than what we were looking for and a little bit higher I guess you guys were talking about high single-digit rate off at the second half of ‘13 which was a bit elevated. But, can you just give us a sense of what’s kind of driving a little bit of more expense growth, is it – is it more of the Xtrakter deal, is it investment for CDS, is it the open trading protocols?
Tony DeLise: Sure, sure Hugh. We thought the second half was better compared to – or better jumping off point compared to 2014. We stated about 9% increase that’s a mid-point. And when you look at the biggest expected increases, as you’d expect it’s in employee compensation and benefit. It’s a little over 50% of where we’ve been in terms of total expenses. The expectation, it was fully staffed up based on our plans. The expectation is headcount would be up another 10% plus over what you see at year end. And the areas where we’re adding people are the areas you expect would be adding people. It’s in technology and sales related areas and it’s around the new initiative. So, yes, it’s exactly where we expected to happen. Quite frankly I think the – after reading some of the notes this morning and looking back at the estimates for next year, I think one of the – one area where you’re all playing catch-up on is in the depreciation and amortization area. We’ll have – if we hit that CapEx plan for 2014, $17 million to $20 million or there about. We’ll have spent over $50 million on CapEx from the past three years, 2012, ‘13, ‘14, over $50 million. I think when you revisit your models you’re going to see that – it’s the depreciation area where you’re going to play a little bit of catch-up. Outside of employee compensation and benefit, headcount driven, outside of depreciation and amortization, driven by CapEx spending. If you look at all the expense categories and what we’re inferring from that is that it’s largely inflationary type increases in those other expense categories, outside of comp and benefits and depreciation and amortization.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay. That’s very helpful. And I guess, switching gears as we think about kind of your efforts with open trading and some of the advances you’ve made there this year in 2013 and then last year in 2013, as you head into ‘14. Should we still be thinking about growth in market share similar to kind of grinding out we’ve seen in prior years with couple of hundred basis point rise in market share? Or do you anticipate that this could be the year where you start to see kind of an inflexion point with share growth?
Rick McVey: Yes, we are ramping up our investments Hugh. Because we expect an acceleration in electronics share at some point. And our views are shared broadly by the industry and by the various analysts that cover our industry when you look at the projections that are out there for the likely electronic share in credit over the next two to three years. It’s very difficult to anticipate the pace of share gain, especially given that open trading is brand new and involves a fairly significant change in trading process for investors and dealers and other market participants. But clearly, whether you look at bonds or swaps or even Xtrakter, we’re investing heavily because we think electronic solutions and connectivity and post trade services are going to be a much larger product of the market environment over the next three years.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay. And have you started to see any kind of change in the institutional client’s you’re working with and their willingness to kind of become more of a market-maker as opposed to just take a price from the dealers and changing kind of the way that they go about investing?
Rick McVey: Well, I would take issue with the term market-maker. We don’t see any of them that want to be in the market-making business and we’re seeing a change in behavior in terms of being willing to lead with a price when they see a potential match in the system, we absolutely are. So, we’re delivering an awful lot of trade opportunities through market list every day. And the solutions that we have to increase the sophistication of the alerts that our investors are getting – continuing to grow each quarter. And with that combination, yes, we are seeing a significant ramp-up in the places back in market-list orders which is leading to the growth in trades. So, that behavioral change is still in the first inning. But it is underway, but in no way do we see any investors that are trying to directly compete with the market-making business. But they are starting to change their behavior so they can respond with the price when they have a trade match.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Sure. I certainly understood, I apologize for the terminology of use of market-making. But that’s what I meant, with the change in their behavior and willing to kind of go out there and then lead with the price. But anyway, I thank you for the insight there. Very helpful.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Hugh.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Adams from Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead. Mr. Adams, please check your mute button.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill: Sorry about that, can you hear me now?
Rick McVey: Hi Mike, we can.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill: Good morning guys. So, a couple of questions here. One, on the market share in high-yield, I appreciate the disclosures you added to the deck of this quarter. But could you give us a sense for the high-yield quarterly market share trends maybe exiting the year, was that above the overall full-year market share of 5.3%?
Tony DeLise: Mike, it was slightly above the average for the year. And if you look at it year-over-year, and I’ll just give you one sort of data point would be for the fourth quarter, well that’s about 200 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And that ramp up happens throughout the year, it did peak in a similar to high-grade market share. It did peak in the third quarter. But there was a ramp throughout the year.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill: Okay, great. And then, Tony, following up on some of your comments on the buy-back. It sounds like you know, it’s not really offsetting future dilutions, it’s actually going to be plain order but it will catch up on some of the share dilutions on 2013. Is that the right way to think about it, so that diluted share count should come down over the course of the year?
Tony DeLise: Yes, Mike, I think that’s the way – that’s the way to look at it. And this is a new program that the board adopted. We said it was to offset the increase in the diluted share count. It has crept up in the last – in the last seven quarters now. We’re going to setup a – it’s viewed as a maintenance type program, we’re going to setup a 10b5-1 plan. We’ll be in the market for small amounts of repurchases each day. It really wasn’t meant to be this sort of large opportunistic. But we obviously have the capacity to do something if the opportunity presents itself. But think of it more as a maintenance program and you think about being in the market throughout the year. It’s not – yes, you can do the math – it’s not a big, it’s not a big program. And today the price sits – it’s roughly 600,000 shares. If we’re in the market accordance with this 10b5-1 program, it’s probably in the course of a year where we’ve exhausted the program.
Mike Adams – Sandler O’Neill: Got it. That’s it guys. Thanks. Congrats again.
Rick McVey: Thanks.
Tony DeLise: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Niamh Alexander from KBW. Please go ahead.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Rick McVey: Hi Niamh.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: If we could talk a little bit about the fourth quarter, I guess, just on the high grades and some of big revenue lines being an important earning driver. How do we think about maybe why the market share peaks, usually we’re used to kind of seeing a bit of a spike in the fourth quarter and then market share comes off typically in the first quarter because there is so much issuance the primary is scattered. So, what can you share there about maybe the market share is dropping off a bit in the fourth quarter and what can you share about January so far?
Tony DeLise: So, Niamh, you’re right. On the fourth quarter we’re affording volumes every month. You see the market share. You see the TRACE volumes. If fourth quarter market share was down about 100 basis points over the third quarter, up slightly from the fourth quarter of last year, honestly it sort of bucked the historical trend here. It’s rare where we would see that sort of decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But when we look at market share, we always say it’s a function of client order flow and hit rate. But when you get more granular, it’s a mix of flow between the bidding or it’s hit rate, on the bid side if hit rate is on the offer side, it’s new issuance block trade. There is a lot of other elements in between it. We just – we’ve finished a four-consecutive quarters ending with the third quarter where we had flow favoring the bid side. And we had a healthier offer side hit rate, we move into the fourth quarter and we had this sort of inverse happening where we have flow favoring the offer side. And then we had hit rates on the offer side which were extremely low. And we’ve had pockets like this before. If you look back at October of 2012, you’re going to see a similar situation. If you look back beginning in 2009 when the market was turning and it was very much an offer wanted market. You’ll see that same kind of experience. I’ll give you this one little – one other sort of data point here. If you look at December, and December was a very good month for us. It was 15.4% market share. It was a good month. It could have been better. It was – we had a lot of enquiries flow coming in, but we had a situation which was very heavy offer wanted. We had the offer side hit rate was down to crisis level, below 50%. So, it was good as it was. In December it was still a challenging environment for us. So, this could set some of the comments that Rick made earlier about providing solutions to help to cope the liquidity challenges. And we went through a pocket just now in the fourth quarter. It’s hard to dig out of that October-November situation with the offer wanted, lower offer wanted hit rates. How hard to dig out of that one. And when come to January one, Rick did make a comment that January share rate now is modestly below the fourth quarter level. Typically in January…
Niamh Alexander – KBW: It’s for high-grades not high-yields right?
Tony DeLise: For high-grade correct.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Thank you very much, okay.
Tony DeLise: And typically, you’ll see – it’s a pretty dramatic decline. It’s probably a 100 basis points decline between the fourth quarter and January. So the view we’re giving you or this early read on January suggests that you’re not going to see that type of typical decline there. The market is little bit different here in January, it’s more of a bid-wanted market. Hit rates have been changed but the market has turned a little bit in terms of the order as well.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank Tony. I appreciate it. And then, the high-end of the emerging markets, can you talk a little bit about the current environment because with the emerging markets, sorry, I guess middle of last year, the big challenge in the industry was like – I guess the offer wanted again, I mean, liquidity kind of dried out. And you were one of the few electronics that people turn to. So, what can you share about the current environment, are you seeing a lot more kind of similar kind of trend like a lot of people trying to sell or – you’re kind of seeing better hit rates in those sickle markets right now?
Rick McVey: The EM environment is definitely choppier than the U.S. high-grade or high-yield environment. There is political unrest, there is concerns about growth rates in the markets has just been more volatile and choppy. And that – the best proxy we have is looking at M2 volumes that are released quarterly. And a portion of EM corporate comes through on TRACE. And it did look like the second half market volumes came off in EM relative to what we saw in high grade and high yield. But these are all estimates based on the best information that we can get. So, not the overall environment is quite as healthy as it is in high-grade and high-yield but the good news is, EM is consistent with the other product areas. And that everything that we can tell we continue to gain share.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Thanks Rick, I appreciate it. And then just lastly if I could, and Tony you said we all kind of have to catch-up of the DNA. I guess, we just didn’t know when all this CapEx was going to kind of translate to the revenue generation phase where you were going to start recruiting the DNA. Can you guide me to maybe it’s a good geography but you already seem like the Xtrakter should be free until second half. Which areas should we be looking forward kind of build up the revenue, could we expect higher revenue with the higher expenses, I mean, investment payback. Is it the information post grade services or we should look for more of that or is it the technology or is it more you’re expecting just more on the trading side?
Tony DeLise: Niamh, we’re not – we really don’t give the guidance around the revenue expectations. So I’ll try and give you a couple of data points and help you zero in a little bit. The revenue growth for next year will not come from that x-services line. Yes, it’s a small piece of what we’re doing, it’s less than 3% of our revenue and that’s not where the growth is going to come from. There are expectations on that information on post grade services line, as Rick mentioned a couple of times around growing data revenues and post grade services. There is some expectations of revenue growth there. You’re going to see growth on that line year-over-year just by virtue of the fact that Xtrakter is in there for 12 months. But over and above that that 12-month adjustment. Yes, there is some expectation of revenue growth there. And you know what drives our business, what drives our business is market share gains and we’ve got that one big line there for commission revenues. So, when you’re doing your modeling just like we do our modeling here, it’s still very much a commission driven outcome. So, it’ll come from that commission line, some contribution from information and post trade services and then the tax service lines today are small piece of what we’re doing.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks and I appreciate it. And then lastly if I could, with respect to open trading and overall, especially the level of integration to the order management systems, I mean, we’re really interested in that aspect and as you roll out to more debt. Help me understand are there few big kind still to catch there or to kind of you can walk not finance obviously but maybe in terms of timing, how that progresses – how are you making progress there?
Rick McVey: Niamh, it’s an important piece because trading efficiency and connectivity we think is a key part of being successful in open trading. And as you know, we’ve being doing a lot of work with BlackRock Aladdin around system integration for BlackRock and the other Alladin clients which totaled approximately 60 investment management firms. And it’s really compelling to see how trading efficiency has improved for Aladdin clients with the integration of market list orders into the Aladdin order boarders to make it easier for those clients to identify potential trade matches and provide a price on market list increase. So, we’re very pleased with that. BlackRock has been through their word of being very focused on Aladdin integration and improved efficiency for Aladdin clients. They’ve also been leading the pack with respect to trading activity and order flow in them market list, so we’re very pleased there. But we are consistently finding new ways that we can also increase that level of efficiency for clients beyond the lag. So, the ecosystem is growing so that the technology can really be much more relevant to clients in terms of the way that display trade opportunities to them throughout the trading days. So, this is a key part of what we’re investing in and we made a lot of progress in the fourth quarter, especially with BlackRock Aladdin and more to come in 2014.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay, fair enough. Thanks Rick.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from Michael Wong from Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Research: Good morning.
Rick McVey: Hello Michael.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Research: Are there one time projects in the 2014 CapEx budget or is this a fairly normal level going forward?
Tony DeLise: That’s a good question Michael. I’d say certainly both 2013 and 2014, I wouldn’t call that the normal run-rate or sort of normal maintenance run-rate for CapEx. And right now there is sort of one – at least one discreet area and that’s in Europe. And today we still reside within the Euro clear datacenters which is part of the acquisition. So our technology environment has been the euro clear datacenters. We will be moving out of those datacenters. So, there are some what I would call not necessarily one time but big chunky cost that won’t recur every year. And that is one element. But looking at it different way, if you think about what the sort of maintenance, longer term maintenance CapEx would be, I’m going to give you a pretty good range but it’s probably more like $10 million to $15 million. And we’re still spending a lot on product enhancements on software development, you could see those numbers and we’re pretty transparent about those numbers. It’s been sort of in that $7 million or $8 million or $9 million range. And then you pack on top of that sort of maintenance CapEx and that’s $2 million to $5 million and you add them together and you get, $10 million to $15 million. So, that’s probably the longer term view. And again, 2013 and ‘14 would have some chunky items in there.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Research: Thanks. And can you talk a little bit about commissioning or who has delivery to see or actually two orders on your SEF?
Rick McVey: Sure. They’re all in partial access rules within the SEF rules that require that any participant on the SEF be in a position where they could both send and receive orders. So our SEF does operate in that way.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Research: Okay. And just really quick one, I mean, with changing interest rate expectations, I mean, you’re seeing some increase in volume trades for floating rate debt, I know it has a low variable fee capture. But do you still expect that to climb from here or is it more or less that’s hygienic well growth?
Rick McVey: I think you know, as expectations grow in a rising interest rate environment, it would be reasonable to expect that the interest and floating rate notes will grow. We do report them separately because the fee capture as you point out is very different so that you can track growth in fixed rate business separate and apart from floating rate business. But overall, we think a rising interest rate environment is going to make the trading opportunities much more interesting and correct. And we have a little snapshot of that in June last year which happened to be our largest month for the year in terms of sharing volume. So, we actually think that the environment overall portrays volume and market activity will be better in a rising rate environment.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Research: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Rick McVey for any further remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. And we look forward to catching up next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-10-23 10:00:00) =====

Analysts:  Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets Niamh Alexander – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Hugh M. Miller – Sidoti & Co. LLC Michael Wong – Morningstar Research  
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded October 23, 2013. And I’d like to return the call over to Mr. David Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you.
David Cresci:  Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses; and then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard M. McVey:  Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2013 results. This morning, we reported our third quarter financial results with revenues of $61 million, up 32% year-over-year, and pre-tax income up 23% to $26 million. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.48 for the quarter, up from $0.37 in the third quarter of 2012. Expenses were $35 million, up 40% from the previous year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in investor order flow resulting in record market share for both high-grade and high-yield corporate bonds. We are pleased with the growing momentum in our Open Trading initiatives. During the quarter, we were granted temporary registration by the CFTC to operate a swap execution facility. SEF trading commenced on October 2. We also finalized the sale of Greenline Financial Technologies in early October and actually that we no longer view as core to our strategy. We are delighted to have made two important board appointments with Lesley Daniels Webster and Jane Chwick bringing extensive risk management and technology expertise to our independent board. The board has approved a $0.13 regular quarterly dividend. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. During the quarter, taxable bond funds experienced net outflows, 10-year treasury yields and volatility ticked up compared to the prior quarter, and primary dealer holdings of corporate bonds remained light relative to historical levels. In spite of these headwinds, high grade TRACE volumes were up 12% in Q3 versus the year ago levels. New issue volumes were healthy during the quarter, led by the record $49 billion Verizon deal. The significant 45% increase in corporate debt outstanding over the last five years combined with the regulatory pressure on dealer balance sheets, creates the need for new electronic solutions for secondary credit markets. Slide 5 highlights our continued strong growth rates. MarketAxess continues to deliver superior growth rates in revenues and earnings. Higher transaction revenues due to market share and volume increases are the primary driver of overall revenue growth. Growth over the last two quarters has been above long-term averages. We believe this is driven by behavorial shift among investors causing an acceleration of electronic trading adoption rates in credit markets. We continued to expand our electronic liquidity solutions for dealers and investors, increasing the value of the platform for our customers. In Europe, we’re investing in product development and integration, so that we can deliver on our promise to offer a unique solution for the region that includes real-time data, comprehensive trading protocols and post-trade services. We are optimistic that our investment in Europe will deliver improved revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. Slide 6 provides information on market share trends in our core products. Our record high-grade and high-yield market share for the quarter was largely driven by a 39% year-over-year increase in overall investor order flow. As the last two quarters demonstrate, order flow continues to build even during periods of rising interest rates, fund outflows and healthy new issuance. Open Trading solutions continue to be a focal point of our technology investments. During the third quarter, we saw an increase in open orders on the system and completed Open Trading transactions were up 79% from the second quarter. Technology integration with BlackRock Aladdin is delivering enhanced efficiency and trading opportunity through the Aladdin network. Sequential growth in Open Trading volumes from BlackRock and other Aladdin clients were significantly above the trading system average.
 : Slide 7 provides an update on the regulatory timeline for SEF trading and on our CDS developments. As I mentioned earlier, we received temporary SEF registration from the CFTC in September. We are working closely with all system participants to propel for the November 1 documentation deadline and the implementation of required swap transactions in the first quarter. We announced earlier this quarter that we were the first SEF to complete pre-trade FCM credit checking through Traiana's credit checking hub. The CFTC has confirmed that they will require pre-trade credit certainty for all FCMs. During the first nine months of the year, our CDS volumes were up 155% compared to the previous year. Although like many SEFs, we have seen a significant decline in CDS index volumes since October 2. We believe the temporary decline in SEF index volumes is due to the challenge that dealers and investors are having in complying with the new rules causing many market participants to transact by phone. We currently expect mandatory trading on SEFs for CDS industries to come into effect in Q1 of next year, at which time, we will review our revenue model. It is interesting to note that our single-name CDS volumes have continued to grow while newly regulated CDS index volumes have temporarily declined. Now, I’d like to hand the call over to Tony, for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Antonio L. DeLise:  Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for a summary of trading volume across product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were up 27% year-over-year to $174 billion. U.S. high grade volumes were $114 billion for the quarter, up 32% year-over-year. Approximately, two-thirds of the high grade volume gain was attributable to the 240 basis point increase in estimated market share and one-third was attributable to the 12% year-over-year increase in TRACE volume. Volumes in the other credit category were up 31% compared to the third quarter of 2012. All of this growth came from high-yield and emerging market volumes, where year-over-year investor order flow increased over 50%. Slide 9 displays our quarterly earnings performance. As stated in our earnings release, on October 8, we sold our Greenline business to CameronTec. Greenline’s operating results have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are not included in the period-to-period comparisons of continuing operations. We have posted a file to the Investor Relations web section of our website, which displays the recast quarterly results for 2011, 2012 and 2013. Revenues of $61.1 million, were up 32% from a year ago, driven principally by a 22% increase in trading commissions and the inclusion of Xtrakter’s post acquisition results. Total expenses were $34.7 million, up almost 40% in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the Xtrakter operating expenses, total expenses were up 15% year-over-year and reflect the ongoing investments in people and technology to support Open Trading, CDS and other initiatives. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 31% and reflects a tax benefit of $2 million related to the domestic production activities deduction, approximately half of which related to 2012. We are updating our guidance and now expect our full year 2013 effective tax rate will be between 36% and 37%. Excluding the impact of certain favorable prior year deductions in credits, our 2013 projected effective tax rate would be closer to 38%. On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. The 30% improvement in variable transaction fees was due principally to a 27% increase in overall trading volume. U.S. high-grade fees per million were $192 in the third quarter, down slightly from the second quarter and down 6% year-over-year. Among other items, our high-grade fee capture is sensitive to yields and years to maturity of bonds traded. The year-over-year decline is largely attributable to higher yields. Fees per million in the other credit category were $317 in the third quarter, up from $294 a year ago and from $309 in the second quarter. The sequential and year-over-year improvement is due to volume mix favoring high-yield volume. Emerging market and high-yield volume accounted for 86% of the other credit category volume in the quarter. Distribution fees were $15.6 million during the third quarter. One dealer migrated from the all variable high-grade plan to the major dealer plan in the third quarter and a second dealer followed the same path on October 1. We currently expect that fourth quarter 2013 distribution fees will be approximately $0.5 million above the third quarter level. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Third quarter 2013 expenses were $34.7 million, up 3% sequentially from the as adjusted figures reported for the second quarter. The sequential increase was driven by personnel increases in support of our Open Trading, CDS and European initiatives and higher amortization expense resulting from new product software development costs. Our total headcount from continuing operations stood at 295 as of September 30, up from 204 at year-end 2012. While it isn’t evident from our reported figures, the operating margins in our core business continued to expand allowing us to fund new initiatives and future sources of revenue. We are updating our full year 2013 expense guidance to reflect the disposition of Greenline and associated discontinued operations presentation. We now expect that full year expenses from continuing operations will be in the range $130 million to $133 million. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and securities available-for-sale as of September 30, were $177 million compared to $180 million at year-end 2012 and $150 million at June 30. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months hit a record $79 million. During 2013, we spent approximately $38 million to acquire Xtrakter and have paid cash dividends totaling $15 million. The dividend payout as a percentage of trailing 12 months free cash flow and earnings per share is below 30%. There was no change in our capital structure during the quarter, we have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Richard M. McVey: Thanks, Tony. We are pleased with the acceleration of growth rates in our business reflected in the results we announced this morning. Increases in overall market volumes and higher market share drove our strong performance. We continue to be optimistic about the future demand for electronic trading in fixed income in light of the ongoing market structure changes. In addition to the strength in our core business, we see positive developments this quarter in our major investment areas for Open Trading, Europe and CDS. We feel that our overall market opportunity continues to get larger. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator:  Certainly, thank you. So ladies and gentlemen, we’ll now conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) So please standby for your first question. Okay, our first question is from the line of Mike Adams, Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good morning.
Richard M. McVey: Good morning, Mike.
Antonio L. DeLise: Good morning, Mike.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good morning, gentlemen. A first question on the other credit revenue category, so you have mentioned in the past that one of the key drivers of growth there has been cross-selling to the existing high-grade customers, as more guys are trading all three products, can you give us an idea of the penetration there, like what percentage of customers are trading all three products at this point and where can that go?
Antonio L. DeLise: Sure, Mike. It’s Tony. The – we’ve given some statistics in the past or some comments in the past about the cross-selling and cross-selling opportunity. Right now, we have around 60% of our clients that trade high-grade emerging markets and high-yield, about 60% of them trade across all three products. And just looking back over the past, say over the past three years, that number was below 40% three years ago, so we’ve made a fair amount of progress with that penetration across all three products.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got you, and is there anything limiting that number from moving up 70%, 80% over the next couple of years?
Antonio L. DeLise: I think that’s a realistic target, Mike. There are some specialized plans that might be only involved in high-yield or EM, for example, but I think 75% or 80% is a reasonable target.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it, great, and then, I appreciate some of the commentary on the success with the Open Trading. You’re in early days, but would you be able to quantify, give us some sort of metric whether it’s – what percentage of overall volume is coming from Open Trading now or as a percentage of market share, what are you seeing today?
Richard M. McVey: Sure and I’ll be happy to. We’ve got the sequential growth numbers that we outlined earlier in the prepared remarks and completed open trades are still less than 2% of our over volume, but obviously growing at a fairly active pace. And I do think that the Open Trading solutions give investors another reason to bring order flow into the MarketAxess system. So I would credit the Open Trading solutions with some of the investor order flow growth that we saw during the quarter, which as, I mentioned earlier, was up almost 40% year-over-year.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Got it. Assuming these are maybe slightly larger trade than average that you are doing on this system. Can we infer that maybe as a percentage of notional value trade, it is slightly above 2%?
Antonio L. DeLise: I don’t think there has been any meaningful change in the average size trade on the system or in the Open Trading versus the traditional client and dealer business. We are obviously working on solutions that would address different trade sizes and some of those enhancements and new protocols we’ll be rolling out over the coming quarters, but today, there is no significant difference in the average trade size.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Great and then one last one here on Open Trading. In terms of like your top 10 institutional client customers in the high-grade business, can you give us a feel for how many of those are actually active right now in the Open Trading protocol?
Antonio L. DeLise: I think it’s safe to say that all 10 of them would be active in some aspect of Open Trading. The first, as you know, Mike, is making orders public to all system participants through Market Lists. As we outlined earlier, we are up over 70% of overall orders that are going into that open order book and I think it’s a safe assumption that of all of our largest clients are utilizing that functionality. With respect to prices back in completed trades, that’s growing pretty rapidly every quarter, and I’m sure that we would find that all 10 of the largest clients have been involved in prices back in completed trades as well.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP:  Got it. Great guys. Congrats on a solid quarter, and thanks for taking my questions.
Richard M. McVey: Thank you.
Antonio L. DeLise:  Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you very much for your questions. Our next question is from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please proceed. Thank you.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Richard M. McVey: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: My first question is – so it’s great news that we are seeing progress from the CFTC on derivative regulation, but are you hearing anything from the SEC on single-name CDS? Are they making any progress in terms of finalizing their rule set?
Richard M. McVey: We have not heard anything new at all this quarter, Patrick. And obviously, there have been quite a few changes at the SEC over the last quarter or two, but there has been no new news out of the SEC on single-name swap regulation so far.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, appreciate that. Next question, so during the quarter BondDesk was apparently up for sale and Tradeweb ended up acquiring in September. Can you talk about whether you guys took a look at and why it may or may not have made sense for you?
Richard M. McVey: Sure. I’m happy to. As you would expect, there’s a fairly short list of likely strategic buyers for e-trading companies like BondDesk, so it’d be fair assumption that we were on that short list. Yes, I think we have expressed potential interest in the retail space in the past. There were a couple of reasons why this was not the right time or the right asset for us. First, we still find very little evidence that there is any meaningful overlap between retail prices even in the very smallest trade sizes and institutional prices. As a result, we didn’t really see BondDesk as a strategic fit with our prioritization around Open Trading. And obviously, any acquisition comes with a fair amount of time and attention from the management team and the rest of staff and we decided that our current priorities are the right ones and, as a result, we were not actively engaged in the end in that transaction.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. I appreciate that color. And then, I guess, building off that point, for my question, despite you guys buying Xtrakter, despite you guys paying out the dividend, your cash position continues to grow. Any update in terms of maybe restarting your share repurchases or other potential uses of that cash?
Antonio L. DeLise: Yes, Patrick, there’s really – the short answer really, no changes in what you’ve seen from what’s in terms of capital management and we have – on the repurchase side, we still have a small repurchase program in place right now. We’ve been opportunistic in how and when we use it, but we really have done no repurchases in 2013 and the board will revisit that repurchase side of it once this current plan expires. On the dividend side, we have been – we had targeted paying out around this one-third or so of free cash flow or one-third of earnings. We’ve increased that dividend in three consecutive years now. Free cash flow is growing, the cash in our balance sheet is growing. That dividend, we’ve pretty much kept pace with the increase in free cash flow. we’ve got the capacity to move it up based on those target amounts, but again, this is something that the board will revisit sometime likely in the first quarter. And just if – one side point on special dividends; a year ago, we did have that special dividend, that’s not likely to be the focus right now. That was clearly at a point in time when we recognized we had built up a sizable position and it wasn’t meant to be a recurring variable dividend in anyway. But think about going forward, think about that regular recurring dividend, that’s something that we have the capacity to move up and something again, the board will take up shortly.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Very good. Thank you, guys.
Richard M. McVey: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question is from the line of Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Thank you.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks, guys. Just following up on Patrick’s capital question, I guess, can you talk a little bit more directly about how you’re thinking about buybacks and attractiveness. I mean, my sense from what you just said is that it’s not something you see as particularly attractive right now given the share price, but I want to make sure that I'm not misinterpreting?
Antonio L. DeLise: Yes, Jillian, we’ve been – if you look back over the last five or six years now, when we’ve done these repurchases, we’ve had one opportunistic repurchase around the JPMorgan sale and secondary offering, and then, we’ve had a series of ongoing repurchase plans. We’ve repurchased those shares at what have turned out to be attractive levels. The stated purpose for most of the recurring plans had been to offset the increase in – the increase in our diluted share count caused by equity grants. If you look back now over the past – over the past seven quarters now, our diluted share count has not moved at all. We’ve – we’re granting with the share price up, we’re granting fewer shares annually, even though we’re increasing the amount of the grant values, but we are granting fewer shares. So we don’t have as much overhang right now in terms of diluted instruments. So we’ve been less active on the repurchase side and if we do put something in place, if we do put a repurchase plan in place or extend or replenish the one that we have right now, there’d be a grid that we would set up, it would be sensitive to the share price. So it would – we’d set up a 10b5-1 program at that point in time, but it’s something that board will revisit. It’s not – it hasn’t been high on the priority list in the last 15 or 18 months right now.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. And then, when you guys were integrating Aladdin, I remember you saying that, you basically installed the technology that would kind of actively scrape their real-time blotters to find matches with other Aladdin users, instead of just kind of like passively uploading a static list, which is the way that your other client-to-client business is working. So I just wanted to get a sense for how specifically that technology is working? Is it having an impact on the level of client-to-client matching, and if so, could it be rolled out to additional order management systems overtime?
Richard M. McVey: Sure. the first stages of integration with Aladdin have resulted in improved efficiency for Aladdin clients in accessing and transacting through our Open Trading solutions and also increased visibility of potential matches. So there is a deeper level of integration between MarketAxess orders that are available in Market List and the Aladdin system, which has been a benefit to the Aladdin clients and also a benefit to Open Trading activity on the system and the tangible results of that are starting to come through in the third quarter with growth rates in Opening Trading transactions and volume through the Aladdin Network that are in excess of the overall system. We do think there are more opportunities to continue to increase efficiency and integration for other clients and some of the efforts are ongoing, but the primary focus right now is making sure that we deliver on our commitments to BlackRock Aladdin and get that integration set up in the best way possible for Aladdin clients.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks. And just a final question on market share, I know it’s been obviously higher recently, and I guess, I had been thinking that it was related to the fact that you have a higher hit rate when customers are selling rather than buying bonds. But it sounded like in your prepared remarks that you were guiding us more to the fact that this is a behavioral shift, an accelerating electronification in the market that should be sustainable regardless of kind of what's happening with the mix of business. So I guess, am I kind of thinking about that right and what do you see that's giving you confidence that this is kind of a sustainable behavioral shift?
Antonio L. DeLise: Yes, Jillian, on the market share, we had the one slide which you gave you a little bit of breakdown between market share improvement and the fees attributable to increase in investor order flow and in dealer hit rates. Clearly, the dominant piece of the growth in market share has been around investor order flow. And quite frankly in the third quarter, we did not benefit from any tailwinds, and I’d say that because block trades, which you know we do better in non-block trades, the percentage of TRACE volume in block trades was flat quarter-over-quarter. So we didn’t benefit from a tailwind there. We didn’t benefit from the new issue environment. There was a very healthy new issue environment. A lot of it driven around what happened in October with Verizon, but you had new issues up, unusually up sequentially quarter-over-quarter and up year-over-year. And even in terms, Jillian, picking up on the bid-offer piece of it, in the third quarter, it was a very balanced order book that we experienced in our platform, about a 50-50 mix, which was actually down in the second quarter, it was favoring the bid side. So we did not have tailwinds from those three areas, which typically we – where we may have had some tailwinds in the past in terms of block trades, new issuance or the bid-offer mix. It’s really, and Rick has mentioned a couple of times about increased order flow, it’s really increased order flow that’s driving that market share.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Richard M. McVey: Thanks, Jillian.
Operator: Thank you very much for your question. Our next question is from the line of Niamh Alexander, KBW. Please go ahead. Thank you.
Niamh Alexander – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Investments, can you just – I mean, it seems like right now you’ve got three major investments underway with, you've got some things going on with Xtrakter, the SEF and then the all-to-all. Do you mind just taking a little bit of time now to kind of expand on exactly what you are doing there? And then, it sounds – from what I can understand, it sounds all good, but that – there's also probably a bit of a drag on the operating margin right now as well. And when do you expect maybe to start seeing some more revenue come through from that investment?
Richard M. McVey: And just to be clear, Niamh, do you want a little bit more color on the investment spend during this quarter or the opportunity ahead of us?
Niamh Alexander – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I think the opportunity ahead of you, Rick, not specifically the investment spend, I mean, it’d be helpful to get a sense of maybe how much there is in terms of the drag on expenses, but exactly what are you spending the money on that you expect to see the revenue come through from?
Richard M. McVey: Right. Well, let’s take them one at a time. Obviously, the SEF comes with a significant new expense for the company both to comply with the trading protocols that are required by the CFTC to establish all the connections with the clearing houses and the SDRs, and then to manage our new compliance and surveillance responsibilities. And as you know, we have not been charging for CDS transactions and it’s something that we consistently said we will revisit at the time the rules are officially implemented, which at this point, we would expect to be in late February. and right now, they made available, for trade certifications are just starting and the CFTC has said that they will take a 120 days to certify swaps and make them available for trading, which would then commence the period where swaps are required to trade on SEFs as opposed to just permitted, which is where we are today. So I do think that we’ll learn a lot more about the competitive position in the SEF landscape over the coming three or four months, but we would expect to see some revenue recognition beginning after the rules are finalized, which we currently expect to be in the first quarter. Open Trading is a huge investment area for us and a big focal point for the company and it’s driven directly by investor demand. There is far greater recognition today than there was a year ago that there is a real liquidity challenge in credit markets and investors are changing their behavior to promote new and more open sources of liquidity. And we think that’s reflected in the increase and acceleration of order flow into the MarketAxess system, and we are still in early days. As you know, we just had a record quarter with about 15% of the high-grade overall market share. and in the past, where investors have viewed electronic trading as a nice to have, we’re moving into a phase where they view it as a must have. And I do think that all of the research that you’ve seen that suggest that investor market share is likely to be higher in electronic trading in the coming years is because of the increased recognition of the liquidity problem and the liquidity challenge brought on by the regulatory changes and we are investing very heavily to be out in front in providing those solutions to our clients. So we think its part of our core businesses doing better and we certainly view it as significant part of the future. In Europe, obviously, historically, we have not done as well in the European region as we have done here. We’ve talked in past calls about the differences in trading protocols and practices in the region. Having said that, the liquidity problem in Europe is arguably worse than it is in the U.S. So we are optimistic that the investments in a comprehensive solution that will promote real-time data, new trading protocols to increase liquidity and post-trade solutions, will get us on a much better growth track over the coming years in Europe. And everything we’ve seen since the acquisition of Xtrakter would tell us that those assets are going to be core to our business in Europe and we’re working very closely with our dealer and investor clients to further develop both the data products and the post-trade services through Xtrakter.
Niamh Alexander – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks, Rick. I appreciate it. I mean, I guess just on the Xtrakter a little bit, there was talk of a tape – there is no required tape as of yet still. I mean, we don't know when the rules will be implemented, but you are working with something on the dealers now. I mean, do you think you can see kind of new revenue from that in the next year? Is there anything you can share with us in terms of how to think about the potential new revenue opportunities?
Richard M. McVey: Yes, no question about it. we are marketing existing data products through Xtrakter and we’re also working very closely with the industry to develop new and valuable data products and because of the lack of quality, price and volume information in European fixed income, we believe we have a significant opportunity to promote the data products. And that we believe will help not only to generate revenue synergies through the acquisition, but we also think integrating those product capabilities will increase the attention on our trading product, so work in progress there. We don’t have any specific targets or goals to share with you, but we certainly believe that that will be part of the value that our shareholders will see from the Xtrakter acquisition.
Niamh Alexander – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, Rick. And then, I guess, you mentioned on the call that you had some – you’re rolling out some new functionality to the dealers and that you've had success with, was it on the Aladdin platform? Can you expand on that and what is it that you are rolling out?
Richard M. McVey: Yes, I think that with all of our Open Trading solutions, they are inclusive of both dealer and investor trading activity and one of the things that we’re doing, as you know, we’ve had a dealer-to-dealer capability primarily to help dealers turn over inventory positions more actively in their secondary credit books. And in the past, those orders have flowed purely between dealers, but one of the enhancements rolling out this quarter will allow dealers to access all system participants through Market List, if they choose to in those dealer-to-dealer orders that are often conducted through lists. So we really are completing the circle, so that the system wide liquidity is available to our dealer customers as well as to our investor customers.
Niamh Alexander – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thanks. And last thing, just some of your functionality, I understand you've been dealing with select clients so far. It's a – kind of a lot more of pulling the trade, because it allows you to access the customer's blotter and then flag to the customer as an actual match, which – it’s kind of much easier to cash the trade that way. Have you made any progress with rolling that out to other order management system providers or any dates you could share or times on getting that out, because it's something we've seen in the equities world that has been very effective for pulling in trades?
Richard M. McVey: Yes, we are – as you know, we are integrated with all of the major order management providers today. The new level of integration, as I mentioned earlier, has – is ongoing with BlackRock Aladdin and we will revisit opportunities to improve efficiency and matching opportunity for clients through the other OMS providers. We are also doing some further connectivity work with individual large clients that are active with us. So this has been an ongoing effort over the last 14 years. It’s not only client on-boarding, it’s deepening the level of integration with their own trading systems, so that we can improve the efficiency of trading for them and now improve the matching opportunities to increase liquidity and reduce transaction costs.
Niamh Alexander – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. I’ll get back in line. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much for your questions. Okay, our next question is from the line of Hugh Miller of Sidoti. Please go ahead. Thank you.
Hugh M. Miller – Sidoti & Co. LLC:  Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.
Richard M. McVey: Good morning, Hugh.
Antonio L. DeLise: Good morning, Hugh.
Hugh M. Miller – Sidoti & Co. LLC:  Good morning. I guess starting off with a housekeeping one. I didn't hear it on the call, but did you guys talk about your expectation for share capture for the October month so far, as we are looking at it?
Antonio L. DeLise: Hugh, we did not have a comment in there on October. And more so, this call and any other call, we still have seven trading days remaining in October, so we are – we’re just about two-thirds of the way through the month. And what I can tell you just around TRACE volumes and you may have seen the same numbers, the TRACE volumes for October has been fairly healthy there. The ADV is over $13 billion for high-grade, down from the robust September levels, but up slightly from last year. High-yield TRACE volumes look like they’re in line with both September and October of 2012. But in terms of color, every time we give color on share with a lot of days remaining, we’re – there is guesswork involved here. so with seven days remaining, it’s just a long period of time and we’re just not going to provide that sort of color right now.
Hugh M. Miller – Sidoti & Co. LLC:  Okay, okay. I guess, in talking about just the overall industry and as you mentioned, yes, I think I was seeing $13.2 billion for October. It’s up about 1% year-over-year, down 14% month-over-month, but I think historically, it’s tended to be kind of an erratic month for volume. Sometimes it can be up from September, sometimes it can be down. Is there any reasoning for that? I mean, I know typically there tends to be some late quarter volume activity by managers, which tends to then result in a sequential decline. But is there anything in particular about October that's an unusual month for any reason?
Richard M. McVey: I think any first month of a quarter, just – and this is all a lot of detail, but the first month of the quarter does tend to be the most active for new issues and as corporations get into their blackout windows towards the late – the latter end of the quarter, new issue volume tends to decline. and I think as you know, given that our market share does fluctuate around new issue activity levels, there is some logic to why oftentimes the first month of the quarter is the weaker of the three. But as you know, historically, in the fourth quarter, share is higher as we approach year-end, as the market is inundated with smaller trade sizes in year-end, fine-tuning of portfolios and generally, light new issues. So that’s certainly been the pattern in previous years in the fourth quarter.
Hugh M. Miller – Sidoti & Co. LLC: Sure, yes. And certainly, I understand that. And I guess looking at the – you guys had talked about the efforts with Xtrakter and kind of strengthening the analytical product offering you guys expect to have out there. Can you talk about kind of the timeframe that we should be thinking about there in terms of integrating that real-time data, being able to provide something to your clients? And is the expectation to charge for that offering or is that something that will be kind of included in order to just strengthen the volumes on the system?
Richard M. McVey: A little bit of both. And in terms of timing, we are already offering the existing Xtrakter data products through MarketAxess BondTicker. So the integration has been complete with the existing product base. New products are likely to be rolling out over the next three to six months and I would expect to start showing progress on some of the revenue synergies over the first half of 2014.
Hugh M. Miller – Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay, that’s very helpful. And then you guys gave some great color and have been talking about kind of the efforts with Aladdin to scrape the blotter and how it has provided some benefits here. But you referred to that as being kind of initial, can you talk about what other steps you foresee being able to do with the partnership with BlackRock and other things that could potentially provide greater order flow outside of this initiative?
Richard M. McVey: Yes, I would put it in two categories. One is the technology integration that we’ve talked about a few times this morning and the other is just very high quality feedback and input into our protocol enhancements and next steps. It’s a great asset to the company to be working so closely with a large and influential investor like BlackRock and not just BlackRock, but the Aladdin client community. And as we mentioned a few quarters ago, BlackRock estimates that the Aladdin clients generate 20% to 30% of TRACE volume. so it’s a significant base of large clients that they work very closely with through their enterprise software – investment management software. So the alliance and the partnership comes with not only the benefits from technology integration, but the validation that we are the right venue for Open Trading and the work that’s being done with the Aladdin clients to develop the right protocols to continue to improve liquidity in credit markets.
Hugh M. Miller – Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. All right, that’s very helpful. And the last question I had was with regards to kind of pricing for index trading for CDS. Obviously, you guys have mentioned that come – for the first quarter, you are likely to start to price that out and charge for the trades. We’ve been hearing about just very competitive pricing there, and wanted to see if you were hearing any changes in the direction on pricing. And in addition, would you anticipate, and I realize the competitive landscape will be very different for single-name whenever that does come about, but should that be very different in terms of how price-sensitive clients will be?
Antonio L. DeLise: As I mentioned earlier, it’s too early to tell. We’re very much in preseason for SEF trading and until the regular season starts, it’s very difficult to anticipate what the competitive landscape will look like. What I can tell you is that we are ready for full compliance with CFTC’s SEF rules today. We have pre-trade credit checking in place and we comply with the impartial access rules. We’re not certain that all of our competitors do. And so there’s a lot to be learned here over the coming three or four months to see where SEFs really shake out for index products. We are – as I mentioned earlier, we have no new news on SEC rules for single-name CDS swaps. Having said that, we’re very pleased with the progress that we’re making with our partner in Barclays in the single-names central limit order book and they continued to make markets in a broader range of single-names. They are marketing the capability with their clients and they are approving more clients for trading on that central limit order book. so we don’t believe that our ability to gain momentum and potentially think about revenue models in single-names is necessarily dependent on the SEC schedule. We like the track that we’re on and we are very pleased that we have that capability as part of our suite of protocols for the CDS market.
Hugh M. Miller – Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay, all very fair points. I appreciate the color. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Michael Wong of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Thank you.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Research: Good morning. 
Richard M. McVey: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Research: Just one SEF competitive landscape question from me, do you have the sense of how interconnected SEFs will be? Does it look like they will just be many separate pools of SEF trading liquidity? 
Richard M. McVey: I don’t know how many, but there certainly will be multiple pools, and right now, I think clients are accessing them independently. I’m sure that clients and dealers will develop their tools to make sure they can access pricing for the different SEFs and transparency is certainly increasing in the swap world, but we’re not aware of anything beyond individual clients’ or dealers’ ability to aggregate pricing.
Michael Wong – Morningstar Research: Okay. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thank you.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Thanks. I just had a couple on quick numbers questions. Did you guys say what your CapEx was for the quarter?
Antonio L. DeLise: We – Jillian, we didn’t give the CapEx number for the quarter and we didn’t freshen up the guidance. I’ll tell you that for the full year and we’re still looking at our CapEx numbers in that $21 million to $24 million range. Year-to-date CapEx were around $17 million or so. So fairly big spend in the third quarter. And we’ve got some items and we’ve flagged these in prior quarters, but we do have some items that would be more of a non-recurring, I hate to say one-time, but I’d say more non-recurring. We did have a primary production data center build out, which just went online in the third quarter. We are just in the middle and hopefully, 30 days away from moving into new office space in London, where we’re combing two offices, so there is a build out there. And some of the Xtrakter related capital expenditures are a bit non-recurring in nature, but we haven’t freshened up the guidance. It’s still $21 million to $24 million and a chunk of that wouldn’t necessarily recur.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. And then on the tax rate, I think you guys said like absent all this funky stuff going on, it would be around 38%. So am I right to think about, like looking at fourth quarter and 2014, am I right thinking that it should be around 38%?
Antonio L. DeLise: Jillian, yes, you did hear it correctly and we had a couple of items and you may recall back in the first quarter, the research credit was reestablished and President Obama had signed a law back in early January to reestablish the credit – the research credit retroactively. So we had a bit of a tax benefit in the first quarter, which related to 2012 and, then in this quarter, the third quarter, half of that tax benefit we recorded also related to 2012 and you read it exactly the way – we hoped it would come out, where if you pulled out some of that noise around prior period impact, the effective tax rate for this year will be around 38% and it’s a little early to give guidance on 2014, but we will do it on the fourth quarter call, but you’re looking at that 38%, that’s probably the best proxy we can give you right now if you’re thinking about 2014.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks.
Richard M. McVey: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Okay, our next question is from the line of Mike Adams of Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead. Okay, Mike, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Sorry, I was on mute there. Just one follow-up on the distribution fees. Tony, I think you mentioned that there was one dealer earlier this quarter that moved from the regional to the major plan. So a couple of dealers down the past two quarters. We've also seen volume, high-grade volume more than double over the last few years. So I think clearly you are seeing some of the value in the order flow that's coming across the platform now, but yet you haven't really changed those monthly distribution fees in years. I'm just wondering when was the last time you looked at that, and is that something that potentially you guys might be taking a look at the value that you are now providing to our dealers?
Antonio L. DeLise: Mike, we do think about the distribution fees and the level of those fees and you’re right, we basically have not changed those fees since 2005. And when you look at the dealers, they are seeing more order flow and the real cause of participating on our platform, at least, in terms of the high grade plan, the dealers in the major plan really would look at those distribution fees. We think we’re at – sort of reached a happy median here and we, arguably, we could move up those distribution fees given the increased order flow. I can’t say it’s high on our list of pricing strategies or pricing schemes that we’re considering right now. So the expectation forward-looking in the near-term is really no change in that average level of distribution fees charged to the major dealers.
Michael E. Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Okay, great. That’s it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you very much for your question. (Operator Instructions) Well, we have no further questions. Thank you very much for your questions. Ladies and gentlemen, I’d now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Richard M. McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a good day. Thank you.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-24 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - Investor Relations Manager Richard McVey - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Antonio DeLise - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Michael Adams - Sandler O'Neill Niamh Alexander - KBW Hugh Miller - Sidoti Howard Chen - Credit Suisse Michael Wong - Morningstar
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess second quarter 2013 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses; and then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2013 results. This morning, we reported our second quarter financial results with record revenues and pre-tax income. Revenues were $65.6 million this quarter, an increase of 34% from the previous year, with pre-tax income up 49% to $31.5 million. Expenses were $34 million, including a one-time favorable adjustment relating to certain out-of-period employee cost, which Tony will cover in more detail. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.51, up from $0.34. Our growth this quarter was driven by record market share and volumes across our three core products; High Grade, High Yield and Emerging Markets. We were especially gratified to achieve this pace of growth in a period of rapidly rising interest rates and shifting fixed income investor sentiment. Our board has approved a $0.13 regular quarterly dividend. We completed the first phase of our integration with BlackRock's Aladdin during the quarter, and we continue to see promising momentum in our open trading initiatives. In May, the CFTC finalized its rules, governing the trading of derivatives on swap execution facilities, and we recently submitted our application to the CFTC for registration of the SEF. Adoption of our CDS products continues and our CDS volumes were up 21% in Q2 from Q1, reaching a new monthly record in June. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. In the last quarter we saw a rapid increase in interest rates with 10-year treasury yields reaching 2.5% at the end of the second quarter compared to 1.9% at the end of Q1. In addition, we witnessed a directional shift for taxable bond fund flows, especially in the latter part of the quarter, resulting in net outflows for the quarter. Credit spreads widened and volatility increased. The shift in market sentiment and increase in volatility led to a 15% increase in high grade trades volumes year-over-year. Second quarter trades volumes were higher than Q1, contrary to normal seasonal patterns. Primary dealer holdings of corporate bonds ticked up modestly, but remain at historically low levels. The proposed increase in capital requirements and restrictions on bank leverage ratios are likely to continue to constrain primary dealer balance sheets for market-making. We believe that electronic trading will continue to play an important role in connecting a broad network of market participants to create new sources of liquidity in credit markets. We are encouraged to see the increase in trades volume and market share during the second quarter, as credit market conditions became more difficult. Slide 5 highlights our continued strong growth rates and diversification. Growth rates in the first half of the year are consistent with our attractive long-term averages. The primary drivers of our revenue and earnings growth are market share gains in our core products; high grade, high yield and emerging market bonds. The number of investor clients trading all three products has increased by 60% since 2010. Our average daily variable transaction revenue increased 36% year-over-year, with the strongest growth coming from other credit products. Variable transaction fees from European clients were also up over 30% year-over-year, demonstrating continued engagement from European investors. The acquisition of Xtrakter has further diversified our revenue stream. This quarter we began delivering end-of-day trade data from Xtrakter through the MarketAxess BondTicker data service, and we remain optimistic about the opportunity to increase our value proposition in Europe through the combination of unique trading and data products. Slide 6 provides information on market share trends in our core products. This quarter we saw an acceleration in our market share growth, despite the increase in interest rates. The primary contributor to market share gains this quarter was an increase in investor order flow. High grade investor inquiry count was up 29% year-over-year and overall inquiry count was up 39%. Our continued investment in open trading protocols is increasing the appeal of the platform to investors as they search for new sources of liquidity. 65% of U.S. high grade orders were submitted to market list in the second quarter, and we saw a 79% sequential increase in completed open trading transactions compared to Q1. We completed the first phase of BlackRock Aladdin integration during the quarter, which creates seamless workflow from Aladdin client order blotters into the MarketAxess open trading functionality. Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Tony for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Antonio DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 7 for a summary of trading volume across our product categories. Our overall global trading volumes were up 30% year-over-year to a record $188 billion. U.S. high grade volumes were also up 30% to a record $118 billion on a combination of market share gain and a 15% increase in TRACE volumes. Volumes in the other credit category were up 47% compared to the second quarter of 2012. We posted record volumes in both high yield and emerging markets during the quarter. Consistent with the driver of a high-end high grade market share growth, the improvement in high yield and emerging markets trading volume was a result of an increase in investor order flow. With six important trading days still remaining in July, month-to-date U.S. high grade trades average daily volume is running approximately 15% below the second quarter level, but around 10% above July 2012. Investor sentiment has improved dramatically in July, causing our month-to-date order balance to shift to the offer wanted side. Our estimated high grade market share is currently running slightly below the second quarter level. Slide 8 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $65.6 million were up 34% from a year ago, driven principally by a 27% increase in trading commissions and the inclusion of a full quarter of Xtrakter results. Total expenses were $34 million, up 23% from the second quarter of 2012. Expenses reflect a favorable out-of-period adjustment of $1.6 million. This item increased second quarter net income by $1 million and diluted EPS by $0.02. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.6%, and within the full year guidance range of 38% to 40%. Our diluted EPS was $0.51 on 37.8 million diluted shares. On Slide 9, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. The 39% improvement in variable transaction fees was due to the 30% increase in overall trading volume of positive product mix and relatively stable fee capture across high grade, high yield and emerging markets products. U.S. high grade fees per million were $195 in the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter. Among other items, our U.S. high grade fee capture is sensitive to yields and years to maturity of bonds traded. During the second quarter, the impact of higher yields was more than offset by a slight extension in maturity and higher execution fees. Fees per million in the other credit category was $309 in the second quarter of 2013, up from $271 a year ago and from $296 in the first quarter. Higher fee capture emerging market and high yield volume accounted for the increase and represented 87% of the other credit category volume in the second quarter compared to 80% one year ago. Distribution fees were $14.8 million during the second quarter of 2013. We currently expect that third quarter 2013 distribution fees will be approximately $0.5 million above the second quarter level. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. Second quarter 2013 expenses as reported were $34 million and include $5.3 million of Xtrakter operating expenses. During the quarter we recorded a favorable out-of-period adjustment to include employee incentive compensation in the pool of costs eligible for deferral under our SEF software development capitalization policy. The second quarter as adjusted column excludes the impact of this adjustment, which affected the compensation and benefits and depreciation and amortization line items. Total expenses as adjusted were $35.6 million, almost half of the year-over-year increase related to higher compensation and benefits, largely driven by the Xtrakter acquisition. Our total headcount as of June 30 was 327. We continue to invest in new product areas and expect that headcount could increase by another 10 or so personnel by yearend. The increase in deprecation and amortization year-over-year as adjusted reflect the significant capitalized software development and equipment spending in the past several years, together with the amortization of the Xtrakter intangible assets. The $1.9 million year-over-year increase in professional and consulting cost is largely due to higher recruiting fees and technology consulting costs. On Slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale as of June 30 were $150 million compared to $180 million at yearend 2012, and $143 million at March 31. During the first half of 2013, we spend approximately $38 million to acquire Xtrakter, paid out our yearend employee cash bonuses of roughly $19 million and paid cash dividends totaling $10 million. Our return on equity for the first half of 2013 was approximately 27% and has increased from 4%, five years ago. The improvement in ROE has resulted from a combination of strong annual earnings performance and return of capital. There was no change in our capital structure during the second quarter. We have no bank debt outstanding and didn't borrow against our revolving credit facility. On Slide 12, we have summarized our 2013 expense, capital expenditure and income tax rate guidance. There was no change to our 2013 expense and tax rate guidance. We now expect that full year 2013 capital expenditures will be between $21 million and $24 million. The $6 million increase in estimated capital spending, primarily relates to the build-out of new office space in London, following Xtrakter acquisition, which we expect to occupy in the fourth quarter of 2013 and higher new products software development costs. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Richard McVey: Thanks, Tony. We are very pleased with the strong growth in our business this past quarter, especially given the shift in market trends. Increases in overall market volumes and market share drove our record results. We continue to be optimistic about the potential for open trading to help support market liquidity. In Europe, we are building on early integration efforts with Xtrakter, and we are excited about the potential to develop unique trading and data products that will help to improve liquidity and transparency in the European markets. And the finalization of the CFTC's SEF rules for swap trading is increasing adoption rates for CDS electronic trading and provides more clarity for market participants. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: So my first question is, Slide 6, in the lower left-hand corner there, you talk about the contribution to market share gains in the second quarter. And you pretty much attributed all to just investors having hard inquiries. So first part of my question there is, I had always thought that when investors are looking to sell down their portfolios, but the hit rates tend to be better in that environment. So I'm a little bit surprised, why hit rate didn't contribute to market share gains? And then I think the second part of the question is, for the market share gains the increased inquiries that you did see. Can you talk about, are you seeing more people participating on that platform or were people willing to go up larger in trade sizes or what were some of the dynamics that you saw during the quarter?
Richard McVey: On the first part of the question about bid side versus offer side hit rates, we had some dynamics during the quarter, where early in the quarter, the investor sentiment was on the offer side. In the June timeframe it was on the bid side. And when you looked at the second quarter compared to both the first quarter and the second quarter of last year, the bid offer ratio over the entire quarters were about the same. It was a fairly balanced order flow. But you're right. Typically, we do better on the bid side than the offer side, but that dynamic over the course of the entire quarter didn't play out that way. So that's number one. And in terms of the number of clients, I can't say there's anything appreciable in sort of the overall number of clients participating. We did continue to see that trend, where we have more cross-selling going on, more clients trading all three products. And your other question around trade size, we look across trade size and whether it was high grade, emerging market to high yield, the average trade size was about the same across second quarter 2013, first quarter 2013, second quarter 2012.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: Second question I have is with interest rates turn on the way back up. You said that, during the second quarter, duration got extended out a little bit, which is a little bit surprising I think. But as you guys are looking at June and July trends, are you seeing duration come back in a little bit and are you expecting any revenue cash implications from that?
Richard McVey: Well, I'll take the first question. I think as we mentioned in last quarter's call, the increase in rates that we saw especially during the second half of the second quarter has offsetting flows with different types of investors. So you did see the mutual fund outflows, which led to some selling. But we also had a group of clients' market participants that have cash available to invest at higher yields, most notably the insurance portfolios in some of the sovereign wealth funds. So the action during the quarter continued to be at the longer-end of the curve. And although, the expectation was that the fed may gradually start reducing the monetary stimulus that they've been providing. There were really very little changes in the short-end of the curve. So the trading activity for us continue to be at the longer-end of the curve, causing a slight extension of average maturities traded on the system.
Antonio DeLise: And Patrick, the only thing I'd add is that, the yield curve actually steepened over the course of the quarter. So where you thought long-term rates go up and specifically the 10-year treasury go up, you didn't see any real movement on the short-end. So you did see a steeper yield curve.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: And then, last one from me and then I'll jump back in the queue. Can you talk about high yield emerging markets, what sort of market share growth you were seeing in those products during the quarter?
Richard McVey: Pretty consistent with what you've seen from us over the past several quarters. We typically don't talk very granular around high yield and emerging markets market share. But when you look back at the first quarter for high yield for example, it was almost a doubling year-over-year in market share. When you look at the second quarter, a big sequential increase, you're not quiet doubling year-over-year in terms of market share. But I will tell you in terms of high yield, only because we can't get a little more granular with the trades information, we were around that's 5% level. It's a little less scientific on the emerging market side, because the information that does come out of the trade association is on a delayed basis, so I don't have perfect information for the second quarter. But you can look at what happened in the other credit category, up 47% year-over-year, big sequential increase as well. We think most of that is a result of market share gains.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Adams, Sandler O'Neill.
Michael Adams - Sandler O'Neill: So following up on Patrick's first question, around some of the market share drivers. One thing on that same slide, Slide 6, that jumped out at me is, the 80% sequential increase in open trading trades that were completed in the quarter. And I'm just curious, was any of that driven by the completion of the phase one integration with BlackRock or is there a little bit of a pent-up order inquiry once phase two of the integration gets completed?
Richard McVey: Just as a caveat, we're still in very early days of open trading and we're encouraged by the growth rates and market list orders, prices back in completed trades. With respect to BlackRock specifically, the thing is, one, integration was just completed in the last few weeks and it's making it much easier for not only BlackRock, but all of the Aladdin client users to seamlessly operate within the MarketAxess open trading functionality. And we are starting to see an increase in activity on the platform from that community, but that is very recent.
Michael Adams - Sandler O'Neill: And then, since we're on BlackRock, has the collaboration to date identified any new areas of focus, new trade protocols, pricing models, et cetera? Any sort of color on the early discussions you guys have had, I'd be curious to hear.
Richard McVey: And the answer is, yes, in all of the above. And it's not just BlackRock, in our opinion, the validation that they provided for MarketAxess being the best positioned venue for developing these new liquidity solutions is having a much broader impact on the investor community in general. And specially, during the quarter we hosted investor working group meeting with 16 of the largest U.S. fixed income money managers, and there was a higher level of engagement than ever before, and a deeper dive around the workflow for the existing protocols and lots of great ideas and enhancements and new protocols. So the focus is running very high. And obviously, the market need for new liquidity solutions is very clear. So I think we're getting a benefit from our direct involvement from BlackRock. We're getting an involvement from both companies investment into workflow solutions for the Aladdin client base. And even more broadly we think it's increased the level of attention and engagement around the MarketAxess open trading solutions with all investors.
Michael Adams - Sandler O'Neill: And then maybe a question for Tony, you were just talking about some of the share gains you've seen in the high yield and the EM trading. I'm curious, is the mix pretty constant right now in terms volume between high yield and EM? And the reason I ask, because I know, it has some implications for the capture trends that have been improving nicely in the past couple of quarters here.
Antonio DeLise: Right. Again, looking at that the other credit category, you can see a significant year-over-year and sequential increase. It's just getting a little more granular, and not to get exact with this granularity, but what we've seen more recently is high yield has been growing a little bit faster than EM, but both of them are growing 40%-plus. So it's not that anyone of them is tailing off anyway, but high yield has been slightly higher in terms of the more recent growth rates.
Michael Adams - Sandler O'Neill: And then one more for you, just a minor clarification here. On the full year guidance, I know you didn't change your expense counts, does that include the $1.6 million benefit for the out-of-period adjustment you realized this quarter?
Antonio DeLise: Yes, it does. Yes. On the guidance side, I mean, you saw what we posted for the first half of the year in terms of expenses, inclusive of that out-of-period adjustment, it was just a little bit north of $65 million. And we gave you that column, which shows you 2Q as adjusted, and that's really the jumping-off point for the second half of the year. So you look at that $35.6 million, which is the second quarter as adjusted. I would use that as a proxy for moving forward. And then realizing, we've had a fair amount of hiring in the second quarter, there is some additional positions we expect to fill in the second half of the year. So once you get the full impact of all of that hiring, I think what we're telling you is expect the second half expenses to tick up from that as adjusted second quarter level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander, KBW.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: The comment on your market share, thanks for sharing, because I guess June was just so high at 16.6. But just to clarify, you said you're tracking a little bit below the 14.2 you did for the full quarter, is that correct?
Antonio DeLise: Yes, Niamh. So a bit of an unusual month here, we're 16 days into the month and 22 trading days in a month. But when you look at the first week of the month, it was around July 4, so there was some noise or some softness in that first week. But we still have six trading days left here. So we've got into this habit of giving you a prelude of the current month. Trades and market share numbers are six. There's still six trading days left. It's an offer wanted trade flow right now coming into the platform. And we're tacking them slightly below that second quarter level.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: On the high grade and emerging markets, and remember last year you had actually talked about putting some boots on the ground and some local people into the local emerging markets. Is that benefiting some of the flow you're seeing there or is it kind of may be still U.S. customers predominantly trading those products? And if it is not, like when do you think you're going to start getting some of the benefit of the kind of local presence and the local products?
Richard McVey: The progress that we've made in EM over the last four to six quarters is primarily driven by U.S. investors that are active in emerging markets and European investors. The local markets activity is starting to tick up. And actually, in Brazil specifically, the tax on foreign investment was just removed in June. And following that change, we've seen a modest up tick in cross regional flow into Brazil local markets. But safe to say, Niamh, that's still in early stages and represents a relatively small part of our EM trading activity so far.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: And then on Xtrakter, and you've had it now for two I guess two quarters. And you've mentioned kind of starting to, is it sell the data, your market data into the bond indicator or how is that going? Help me think about maybe some revenue synergies that you're are you seeing that you might have kind of had as much confidence initially when you closed the deal?
Richard McVey: From a business perspective, I think everything is on track. What we really believed, the opportunity was with the combination of Xtrakter MarketAxess Europe is exactly according to the initial expectations. And we're very encouraged by both the dealer and investor response to some of the ideas that we have around the data products. So the timing of achieving those synergies is always an open question, but we feel, at least, strongly about the opportunity today as we did in the months that we were analyzing the acquisition opportunity.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: And then, I guess, just on the capitalization, what was it exactly? Sorry if I missed it on the call, but what was it that you capitalized that you were accruing quarterly before?
Antonio DeLise: Sure. This will be a little bit of an accounting exercise here, but in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we capitalized a software development costs, associated with internal used software. So I'm giving you sort of a technical description here. What that means is that if we're doing a significant build around our open trading platform, once that project reaches technological feasibility, we start deferring the costs, and then they get amortized over three years, once the project goes into service. Very typical; every company out there is doing the same thing. What happened in our case, in the second quarter, we were doing a review of the pool of costs that we were capitalizing, and we determined specifically, we weren't picking up the incentive bonus pool. So we went through an exercise of analyzing what the impact would be historically and what the cumulative impact would be. So we pushed through the cumulative impact in the second quarter. Now, the important piece is going forward, we're going to start deferring or as part of our capitalization policy, we will start deferring the employee bonuses for our development and QA team on qualifying projects. But I think the important message is we don't think that that's going to have a material impact on our results going forward, because what you'll have, you'll have a deferral of bonuses, but then you're also going to have the amortization expense rolling through. So net it may affect the two individual line items, but we don't think it's going to have material effect in any given quarter in a year up prospectively.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: And then lastly, if I could, just I saw you registered with the CFTC for a SEF, but I guess single-name is the product that, single-name credit derivative is the product that we would kind of associate more with your potential revenue opportunity.  Maybe we are wrong there, maybe it should be the index, but that's something that, just help me understand the SEC hasn't even kind of defined the rules yet, so you can't actually apply for SEF status there, is that correct? And if that's the case, I mean, should we be thinking about the ability to capture some revenue there in 2014? And if we don't have those rules defined, would it be kind of better to think of it as more of a longer-term opportunity?
Richard McVey: It remains to be seen. We agree we've seen nothing so far from the SEC that would indicate their timeline for securities based SEF rules, which will govern this single-name CDS market. And we'll see what happens. Certainly there has been an increase in the number of CDS clients on the MarketAxess system over the last two quarters. Some of those clients are active in both index and single-name products. The trading rules for index will be implemented early in the fourth quarter. So we would expect that to drive another uptick in electronic trading in the index product. And one would think that that too would cause people to trade more of their single-name trades electronically, but we have no way of knowing currently when the rules will be implemented by the SEC for single-name swap trading.
Niamh Alexander - KBW: And you're not showing as volume currently, but customers are executing on the platform. Are you charging customers yet or when can we get some timing on when you could do that?
Richard McVey: We are not charging for CDS transactions yet. And as we've said in the past, we would expect to begin charging for transactions around the implementation of the SEF rules. But just by way of caution, one of the changes in the final rules was the lowering of the block trading threshold, which reduces the percentage of CDS index volumes that would be subject to the new trading rules in the first year. So we're guessing now that somewhere around half of CDS index volume will be subject to the new rules, the other half will qualify for block trades, which are exempt in the first year from SEF rules. And given that CDS index swaps are the most commoditized in liquid swaps, we expect the transaction fees for indices to be relatively low. So you should see some revenues emerging by the end of the year, but in our opinion it's not likely to be material to company results.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller, Sidoti.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: So I guess, in piggybacking also last conversation about CDS, it's a great point that you made there about kind of the commoditized nature of index trading. And you guys have talked about the rise in volume activity on the platform, but do you think with index relative to single-name that that's going to be very price sensitive. And in that there is not as much of a value-add from the platform because it's not so thinly traded. What are your views there? And do you think that we could go to an environment where it's just kind of people just walking to whoever is the low cost provider?
Antonio DeLise: It's a fair comment. What you see in commoditized products is it's more difficult to differentiate your trading solution based on unique liquidity or trading functionality. And when you look at where we have differentiated ourselves historically in the bond areas, we think it's really about developing world class technology solutions for highly fragmented less liquid markets where we've been able to demonstrate that we have a liquidity and technology advantage. And when systems lack those advantages, obviously it shows up in pricing. So we would expect as we've said in the past that CDS index pricing is probably going to look a little bit more like on the run government bond electronic trading pricing than it is corporate bonds.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: And can you just review with us again the figures you guys have put out with the increase in volume activity on CDS? And is there disparity right now at this point between the growth in index versus single-name trading on your platform?
Richard McVey: It's fair to say that most of the growth right now is coming from the index products. Having said that we still believe that we're the only platform, which lies in index, single-name and option on indices and we have trades going through the platform consistently in all three.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: And another question just about the shift in sentiment in market dynamics for the outflows kind of happening towards the latter part of the quarter and then into July, given that we did kind of see the typical seasonal pattern of kind of slower industry volumes through July relative to June, with the kind of dynamic shift that we've been seeing on the flow side. I mean do you anticipate that industry volumes will continue with the seasonal patterns, with the slower volumes in the second half of the year or does the shift in dynamics probably disrupt that from happening for the industry?
Richard McVey: Yes. I think there two important factors. Obviously, the seasonal factors would say all else equal to secondary volumes tend to be lower than the first half. But the all else equals the $64 million question. What we saw in June is that when volatility picks up and creates new trading opportunities, market volumes go up. So we would be optimistic that if volatility does return throughout the second half, that you could see some offset to the seasonal factors, just like we did in the second quarter. It's highly unusual and we think encouraging to see TRACE volumes overall for Q2 higher than Q1. So in my opinion there have been two factors that have held back secondary trading volume in the last several years. One is the decline in overall market liquidity, which has caused an increase in transaction costs. And the other is the very low levels of volatility. And what we are working very hard on is providing the new liquidity solutions to reduce transaction costs and improve overall market turnover as that is combined with increases in market volatility, we would be optimistic on secondary volumes overall.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: I guess in playing devil's advocate to an extent, at what point would the potential for taxable fund outflows on a consistent basis start to kind of worry you, just about overall industry volumes and new issuance?
Richard McVey: Obviously a sustained period of outflows and investor selling, at some point could exceed the capacity for dealers and others to warehouse that inventory, which is all the more reason why we and the rest of the market are moving quickly to developed alternative solutions. The market needs to move forward. We've had substantial regulatory change. And it's critical that the market embrace new liquidity solutions and then change in trading behavior, so that we can be confident that we have a market with more liquidity, irrespective of overall investor flows in the direction of interest rates.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: It also seems like in June, one of the things that was a benefit on the market share was just the limited new issuance during the month. And I haven't been able to see figures yet on new issuance in July, but is one of the reasons for maybe return to more normalize market share levels is just reemergence of new issuance or has that not been the case in July?
Antonio DeLise: Hugh, so far in July, what we've seen is new issuance has been pretty light. There were a couple of days there peppered in where there was a pretty heavy calendar, but so far at least to the first half of the month, it looks pretty light.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: And another question I have was with regards to the extension on the years to maturity. It seems like the sentiment, I'm hearing, is that some institutional investors were kind of taking advantage of the steepening of the yield curve, maybe that's why you were seeing more activity on the longer-end for you guys. But do you view a potential risk if the sentiment maybe changes towards rates continuing to rise and the potential for seeing institutions to maybe go a bit shorter on the curve?
Richard McVey: I think overtime that's certainly a possibility. And if short-end yields become more attractive, it's certainly possible that some of the flows would move back into shorter-end. And as you know, what we've said about that in the past that too comes with an offsetting factor, because our market share of shorter maturities tends to be higher than longer maturities. So if we get a shift back in that direction, although it's equal, we could see a decline in the average fee capture, but we would also expect it to come with an increase in market share.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti: And then the last question I had was with regards to the commentary about some hiring in the second half of the year. I think you guys have mentioned about 10 people and some of the new market development, if you could just give us a bit of a sense of where you're adding to and the opportunities there?
Antonio DeLise: Sure. Just looking at the headcounts from even the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter, we added 21 personnel. And then I mentioned in the prepared remarks, another 10 or so were scheduled for the second half of this year.  And in fairness some of those hires are replacement positions, but in most cases and this is a vast majority, it's around the new initiatives, particularly Europe, what we are doing a fair amount of hiring in Europe, building out not only the infrastructure, but then adding some capabilities on the data side. It's around open trading. And even in our core business, I would say that we've continued to build infrastructure to support the growth in the core business. So I could argue every position has been around growth. So it's largely been in support of the growth and the newer initiatives including Europe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen, Credit Suisse.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Rick, you noted few times that the progress and the efforts you're making in open trading. So it certainly feels top-of-mind. And I was hoping you could just refresh us on financial contribution today? Any long-term financial goals that you have and how you hope to see the arc of that growth over time?
Richard McVey: As I mentioned it's a small percentage of our completed trades currently. So for the second quarter open trade transaction revenues are not material to the overall story. But I do think the expansion of trading protocols and counterparties and the goal of new sources of liquidity all contribute to the increase in investor order count in volume that we're seeing. So the response that we're getting from investors is very favorable. I think that it's top-of-mind for them in terms of developing new solutions and it's driving more order flow into our system. And I think over the next two or three years, it's quite possible that open trading could have the same kind of impact on our market share and revenues that the expansion into the regional dealers and alternative dealers did, beginning in 2009.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: And then switching gears, even if you exclude the one-time adjustment this quarter, your operating margins close to this 46%, they're at a level they haven't been in quite a few years. I know a lot of work goes into achieving that. And you and Tony spoke about the traditional second half seasonality and the hiring. But just taken a step back, I was just hoping you could comment on your desire to kind of maintain and expand the operating margin in these mid-40s levels, if not higher or philosophically investing some of that back into the business?
Antonio DeLise: On the operating margins, your observation is correct. First half of the year, it was around 46%. And even when you take out that out-of-period adjustment, we did have $1.5 million of Xtrakter transaction cost in the first quarter, so the two kind of counterbalance each other. So we're running it around 46%. And I'll tell you that while in the near-term we did provide some guidance on the prior calls around the impact of Xtrakter. We are expecting them in the near-term to be earnings neutral. That does that caused some depression in margins or in margin growth, but our expectation going forward, you've heard some of the comments from Rick around open trading and at CDS in some way we get some contribution from CDS. And then beyond that if the data synergies and trade matching synergies and if we can drive more flow to the European platform through the Xtrakter combination, we do think we can accelerate on the revenue side. So our expectations going forward are, not that will be sort of, stagnant at this mid-40s level. Clearly, when we look out in our five-year plans, we do have an expansion in the absolute operating margins. We do have incremental margins, looking more like historical periods. And not that we provide either revenue guidance or margin guidance, but we do expect margins over the longer-term to expand from what you're seeing right now, even though we're investing in new initiatives. So even though we're continuing to invest in open trading and from international expansion, and the Europe, even with those initiatives we do expect margins to expand longer term.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: And then, final question for me. I imagine, it's not a material driver of this quarter's results, so more out of curiosity, if you saw anything unique around the Apple debt offering, given just the absolute size of that deal?
Richard McVey: I don't think anything earth shattering or out of the ordinary with the Apple deal, but certainly one of the market factors that gives us confidence in the future opportunity is the significant expansion in corporate bond debt in the U.S. market. And since 2008, corporate debt outstanding is up about 50%. So we've got a much larger base of corporate debt. And if we return to more normal levels of liquidity and market turnover, TRACE secondary volume would be closer to $4 trillion per year versus the $3 trillion per year, where we've been averaging. So Apple is just one example of opportunistic corporate bond issuers in a low rate environment, expanding the base of corporate debt outstanding.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Wong, Morningstar.
Michael Wong - Morningstar: Are run rate SEF costs already in your result or will more come in when it's really up and running?
Richard McVey: Michael, most of the costs are already built into to what you've seen in the first half of the year. There will be a little bit of uptick here with the rule finalization in June around the CFTC SEF rules. There will be some expense expansion in the second half of the year. It's not million of dollars, but particularly around the compliance and surveillance side. There will be some expansion there, but in terms of an annual run rate expansion, it's something like a million dollars above what you've seen in the first half of the year.
Michael Wong - Morningstar: And after the rise in interest rates, have you seen any large differences in behavior between your large and regional broker dealer clients?
Richard McVey: No. Not really any shift. The business breakdown between large dealers and regional dealers is relatively stable over the last three or four quarters.
Michael Wong - Morningstar: And the last one from me. If outflows continue for a fixed income funds, would you expect that percentage of a block trades to increase or decrease?
Richard McVey: The trend in block trades has been down. And anecdotally what we hear consistently from investors is that primary dealers today do not have the capacity to take BlackRock's on to their balance sheet the way that they used to, so large dealers are operating on an agency basis increasingly. So our expectation would be given the balance sheet constraints that the percentage of trades volume and block trades is more likely to continue to decline. Having said that there hasn't been significant change over the last six or eight months, we've been fairly stable in terms of block trading volume percentage of TRACE relative to non-block.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: A couple of quick follow-ups for you, Tony. First, if I heard correctly, I think you said that, we should expect distribution fees to be up $0.5 million on a third quarter versus the second quarter. If I did hear that correctly, can you kind of talk about, is that U.S. or is it Europe?
Antonio DeLise: So Patrick, it's in the U.S. and then more specifically we've got one dealer that we're aware of right now, that's going to move from the all variable plan into the plan that has the combination of the fixed fee and variable elements. So if you remember, going back when we have that sort of movement, we expect an increase in distribution fees, in this case in the U.S. And we would show a sort of corresponding decrease in variable transaction fees. Around net neutral to revenues, but within the components themselves you will see a little bit a shift.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: And then, my second quick question is if we look at the quarter-over-quarter increase in your adjusted employee comp, so from $16.4 million in the first quarter to $18.9 million in the second quarter. How much of that was due to hiring versus how much was because you had higher variable bonus accrual because it was a really strong earnings quarter for you guys.
Antonio DeLise: Patrick, just looking at the absolute numbers, most of that comes from the addition of Xtrakter. So we had them in for one month in the first quarter, and then two months in the second quarter. And then, the second biggest item would be around the variable element of our bonus pool, which is tied to performance. But the Xtrakter impact is by far in a way the bigger of the two.
Operator: You have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Richard McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded April 24, 2013. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Go ahead, please, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. For the call Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard M. McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2013 earnings call. This morning, we reported our first quarter financial results, with another solid quarter in which we achieved record revenues, pre-tax income and EBITDA. Revenues for the quarter were $55.6 million, up 9.5% from $50.7 million a year ago. The main driver of revenue growth was an increase in variable transaction fees, which were up 12.5% to a record $32.5 million from $28.8 million in the prior year. Pre-tax income was up 6.9% to $24.3 million. Our board has approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.13. The annualized dividend payout ratio is approximately 30% of trailing 12 month EPS and free cash flow. Our estimated high-grade market share was 12.3% up from a 11.4% last year. In addition, we continue to see growth in our emerging markets and high-yield products with combined volumes up 36% year-over-year also a record. Last night we announced a strategic alliance with BlackRock to create a unified electronic trading solution. Our goal is to reduce fragmentation and improve liquidity in the credit markets by providing a wide range of electronic trading solutions to a vast network of dealer and investor market participants, in Europe we finalized our acquisition of Xtrakter during the quarter and we’ve begun the process of integrating the two firms, we continue to see ample opportunities in data trading and post-trade services with the combined capabilities of MarketAxess and Xtrakter. Slide 4, provides an update on market conditions, Q1 TRACE volume show their normal seasonal pattern with market volumes very similar to one year ago, and up about 20% from Q4 2012, we believe that the growing phase of corporate debt outstanding will create more secondary trading opportunities in the future, flows in the taxable bond funds remain strong at $55 billion during the first quarter, primary dealer holdings of corporate debt for market making were up slightly during the quarter, but remain more than 75% below peak levels, reflecting balance sheet constraints. Slide 5, provides an update on our Open Trading Initiatives, as mentioned previously we have announced a strategic alliance with BlackRock to create a consolidated electronic marketplace for credit trading, the alliance will facilitate seamless trade flow between users of BlackRock, Aladdin Enterprise Investment System, and the MarketAxess Trading Community. BlackRock will take an active role in promoting and marketing the MarketAxess’ open trading solutions in order to improve liquidity in credit markets. We made good progress with our open trading initiatives in Q1. 59% of all high grade inquires on the system will placed into the Market Lists open order book, while still a small percentage of overall trades, completed client to client trades increased 62% from the fourth quarter. To complement these developments on our corporate bond platform we also launched a central limit order book for trading of single name credit default swaps with a major swap dealer yesterday. This capability is an addition to the multi dealer RFQ and streaming protocols we already have live for CDS on this system. Our quarterly CDS volumes have been growing in a sequential rate of 64% since the first quarter of 2012. In spite of ongoing delays in the finalization of SEF rules we are moving forward with our CDS electronic trading capabilities. Slide 6 highlights estimated market volumes and revenue sensitivity in our core products. We believe that the electronic share of credit trading is still in early stages, while we believe we represent the vast majority of electronic trading in the U.S. corporate bond market we currently represent about 12.3% of the total secondary volume. Our estimated market share of emerging markets and high yield trading is around 5%. Market demand for new electronic trading solutions is running high and most industry analyst projected significant increase in the electronic share over the next three to five years. Variable transaction revenues are the most important driver of long-term revenue growth. As you can see in the bar chart we continue to benefit from strong growth in total variable transaction revenues. Transaction fee growth represents the combination of market share gains in high-grade, high-yield and EM and higher fee capture. Q1 average daily variable transaction fees were up 16% year-over-year and reached a new record of $540,000. Based on our current fee capture and current secondary market volumes we estimated 1% market share gain in U.S. high-grade drives approximately $5 million in additional annual revenue, both our high-yield and EM products have similar revenue sensitivity for a 1% increase in market share. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for additional detail on our volumes and financial results.
Antonio L. DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide 7 for a summary of trading volume across our product categories. We have created two new volume buckets that are intended to help clarify volumes trends by grouping together instruments with similar liquidity characteristics and fee capture. The other credit category now includes high-yield, emerging markets, Eurobonds and structured products and the new liquid products category include U.S. agencies and European government bonds. We will continue to report high-grade separately. Our overall global trading volumes were up 2% year-over-year to a record $160.4 billion. U.S. high-grade volumes were record $101.2 billion for the quarter up 3% year-over-year, TRACE volumes were down 4% from the previous year. Volumes in the other credit category were up 19%, compared to the first quarter of 2012, all of this growth came from high-yield and emerging market volumes which were up a combined 36% year-over-year. Liquid product volumes were down 30% year-over-year over 90% of these volumes were attributable to U.S. agency bonds. Our agency volume decline is consistent with the 30% drop in reported agency volumes on trades. With five important trading days still remaining in April we currently expect April high-grade and high yield market share to be above the first quarter levels. Slide 8 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $55.6 million were up 10% from a year ago, driven principally by a 13% increase in variable transaction fees and the inclusion of the Xtrakter results since the February 28 acquisition date. Xtrakter revenues are reflected in the information and post-trade services revenue line. Total expenses were $31.2 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2012. Excluding Xtrakter operating expenses and transaction related costs, total expenses were up less than 1% year-over-year. The first quarter 2013 income tax provision includes a benefit for certain 2012 tax credits enacted into law in January of this year amounting to approximately $400,000 or $0.01 per diluted share. Excluding this item, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 38.4%. Our diluted EPS was $0.41 on 37.7 million diluted shares. On slide 9 we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. To facilitate the transition to the new volume reporting buckets, we have posted a file on our website summarizing quarterly commissions volumes and fees per million under both the new and old formats for the past nine quarters. The U.S. high-grade fees per million were $191 in the first quarter, consistent with both the prior year levels, and the fourth quarter, we have experienced a decline in the years-to-maturity of bonds traded on our platform over the past six quarters, but fee capture continues to benefit from the low yield environment, fees per million in the other credit category were $296 in the first quarter of 2013 up from $269 a year ago and from $291 in the fourth quarter. Higher fee capture emerging market and high yield volume accounted for the year-over-year increase and represented 82% of the other credit category volume in the first quarter compared to 72% one year ago, distribution fees were $14.7 million during the first quarter of 2013 down 8% from the first quarter of 2012. We currently expect that second quarter 2013 distribution fees will be consistent with the first quarter level. Slide 10, provides you with the expense detail, the 12% increase in total expenses from a year-ago were almost entirely attributable to the Xtrakter acquisition. In the first quarter, Xtrakter operating expenses were $1.7 million and investment banking and other transaction related costs were $1.4 million. The year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization reflects a significant capitalized software development and equipment spending in the past several years, together with the amortization of the Xtrakter intangible assets. The year-over-year and sequential increase in professional and consulting fees is largely attributable to the Xtrakter transaction costs. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash equivalent and securities available for sale as of March 31 were $143 million, compared to $180 million at year end 2012. During the first quarter we expended approximately $37 million to acquire Xtrakter and paid out our year-end employee cash bonuses of roughly $19 million. There was no change in our capital structure during the quarter, we have no bank debt outstanding and didn’t borrow against our revolving credit facility. On slide 12, we’ve summarized our updated 2013 expense capital, expenditure and income tax rate guidance. With the inclusion of the Xtrakter results effective March 1, we now expect the total 2013 expenses will be in the range of $137 million to $143 million. Xtrakter operating expenses for 2013 are projected to be approximately $20 million inclusive of depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3 million. We expected roughly 55% of the extractor operating expenses were relates to compensation and benefits expense. Capital expenditures include computer software and equipment, capitalized software development costs and data center build-out costs. As communicated on previous calls, we’ll be making a significant technology investment in the Xtrakter business over the next several years. We now expect the total capital expenditures will be between $15 million and $18 million in 2013. We continue to believe that the effective tax rate for the full year 2013 will be between 38% and 40%, among other items the mix of U.S. and foreign source income could cause variations in the effective tax rate. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Richard M. McVey: Thanks, Tony. We are pleased with the record first quarter results and the continued momentum in our high-grade emerging markets and high-yield products. Our strategic alliance with BlackRock represents a major step forward for our open trading initiatives and for the development of new electronic liquidity solutions in credit. We are also happy with the progress to date integrating the Xtrakter business, and repositioning our European operations for growth. The CDS market continues to embrace electronic trading solutions in spite of the ongoing regulatory delays. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions
Operator: (Operator Instructions) First question comes from the line of Mike Adams from Sandler O'Neill.
Michael Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Good morning, Rick. Good morning, Tony. Congrats on a solid quarter
Antonio L. DeLise: Thank you, Mike.
Richard M. McVey: Thank you.
Michael Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: So first, I just wanted to start by touching on the announcement from last night the alliance with BlackRock, can you give us any sense for what the activity levels have been like on Aladdin in terms of transactions and value traded? What kind of client overlap are we talking about, are there really any unique customers connected to Aladdin that aren’t on your platform right now?
Antonio L. DeLise: We really don’t have any detailed information on the trading volumes on ATN. What BlackRock has been very consistent in saying is that they had two primary goals with ATN; one was to improve liquidity in credit markets with the benefit of all market participants, and the other was to improve the Aladdin value proposition, and we have been working closely with BlackRock and Aladdin consistently over the life of the company and we’ve been talking with them over last year about different ways that we could help them with those objectives, and at this point we’re very pleased that they’ve just decided that the best way for them to facilitate those goals is to combine their work with MarketAxess. With respect to the clients of Aladdin you are right, the majority of the Aladdin clients are MarketAxess users today. However, the work that we contemplate involves much deeper integration between the Aladdin enterprise investment system and the MarketAxess trading system and to the extent that we can both make it easier or more efficient for those clients to transact on the platform. We think the likely-hood is that we will find any increase in the order matching opportunities and acceleration of adoption rates. And it’s a very powerful community. There’s about $14 trillion in assets in total in the Aladdin client base and the BlackRock estimates are that that client base represents something around 30% of the publicly traded corporate debt activity in the U.S. market. So it’s a very powerful community and we’re very pleased to be working with them and that the integration work is already underway.
Michael Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Got you thanks Rick. And then maybe this is one for Tony, but on the distribution fees, you saw an uptick in the other credit line this quarter for time we’ve seen that in a while, is this something that’s related somehow to Xtrakter or maybe you’re adding some new deal or do you mind giving a little bit of color there?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah sure Mike. The uptick I say was pretty modest, so it’s up a couple of hundred thousand dollars and you’ll recall in Europe we did adjust the distribution fee plan back in March of last year and we hadn’t had any dealer movement since that time and really the only change from the fourth quarter in that category, we do have some programs for emerging markets and high yield where some dealers are subject to what the minimum fees each month and some of that residual has now fallen into that bucket. But really nothing to speak of there and just, the expectation going forward is that the distribution fees in the second quarter will be consistent with the first quarter, we are not tracking any movements in dealers migrating from one plan, say the variable plan to the fixed plan either in the U.S. so far in Europe, so, you can’t always cautious around those dealer movements as dealers respond to market conditions and the regulatory environment, but right now, we’re just not tracking anything significant.
Michael Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Okay, thanks. And last one from me, I don’t believe you bought back any stock in the quarter, would that, is that entirely related to the Xtrakter acquisition that closed or if it’s something to do with, getting what the stock is trading now like near at all time highs maybe just a less attractive use of capital, do you mind this comment like what maybe we could expect next couple of quarters?
Antonio L. DeLise: Yeah, sure. So Mike, you are right, in the first quarter we did not repurchase any shares and you recall we had a pretty active repurchase program or repurchase activity in 2012 we repurchased over 2.5 million shares last year, $75 million in change was expended last year, those repurchases were accretive to earnings, at this time we got a small program remaining under an existing authorized program, but we’re going to be opportunistic in how we use that going forward
Michael Adams – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Okay, thanks. That’s all from me.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks, guys. I was just wondering on the BlackRock, I guess, agreement, can you give us an (inaudible) how that works from a financial perspective. I guess, some kind of revenue share, I guess, I am not entirely clear how you get compensated for it.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, there is no revenue share involved with the agreement with BlackRock. It’s really about the integration and the seamless workflow between the two platforms and a commitment to work together to bring industry participants together to promote open trading solutions. And our model, Jillian, hasn’t changed. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the majority of our revenue comes from commission revenue and there will be transaction fees for open trading just like we do have it today in our core business for RFQ client to dealer trading. So there is really no change in the economic model here.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. So as this BlackRock problem grows, it’s a same thing as if your own client to client business within MarketAxess were growing from a P&L perspective?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, that’s the case. We may try different models around fees to incent volume whether that’s with BlackRock or Laden or other active clients in an attempt to accelerate the adoption rates, but you are correct, the basic fee plans will be the same.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks. Then on the agency and high yield, I think last quarter you guys mentioned that a lot of the growth is coming from clients that are already active in your high-grade products, so they are simply expanding the breadth of the products that they trade on your system? And I was hoping maybe you can give us an idea for penetration there, we are talking 25% of your current high-grade users are also using high yield emerging markets which is higher and what where can that figure go longer term?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, I don’t think that we have a specific overlapped numbers prepared today but we’re happy to come back to you and rest of the analysts with those kind of stats in the future, but there’s no question that most of the volume that we are enjoying in the growth of high yield in EM is coming from existing high-grade clients that have just gotten more comfortable trading even less liquid products electronically. But there is still a base of clients that are still primarily in high-grade where there is remaining opportunity to continue to cross sell them and to get them involved in more product areas.
Unidentified Company Representative: And Jillian, I haven’t [stretched up] the statistics, but the last year when we looked at this, we had more than 400 unique clients trading both emerging markets and high-yield products and that’s something less than we had in the high-grade product area, but it’s needless to say that there’s a fair amount of overlap and we think we’ve reached the fair amount of critical mass outside of high-grade now in emerging markets and high-yield
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. Then well, I am not sure how much the supplies (inaudible) operation by (inaudible) so the collateral requirements for single-name clearing from the buy side for CDS has been set kind of surprisingly high, I guess, by the SEC and some of the clearing houses, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense even after clearing given these developments and I know this was one of the areas where you guys had seen a competitive advantage for yourself in a single name. So, I just wondering if those margin issues and everything that’s going on with the SEC between the SEC and IS, has an impact on your platform or whether this is something that you don’t really see playing into longer-term growth prospects for your swap execution facility?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, we may not be your best source on the collateral requirements in the impact on single name trading, but what we can say is that we certainly are hearing anecdotally that the margin requirements for bank owned FCMs, which the SEC has temporarily established we understand it twice the level of the clearing house margin requirements has slow the transition clearing of single names into the clearing houses. And if you look at the DTCC data Julian index volume seem to be holding up reasonably well, but single name volumes have been declining. And it looks last link are down somewhere around 25% from where they were a year or to ago. So there has been some impact there it’s very difficult to estimate what portion of that is coming from some of the [introduction] around the margin requirements in central clearing, and what might be attributable to the lack of volatility in some of those names in fewer trading opportunities in the short-term because of that the lack of the volatility in the interest rate environment.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, got it. And then just one final one from me, I was wondering if the BGC sale of (inaudible) and kind of the multiple they are able to garner that electronic trading platform has led you guys to kind of rethink any of your opportunities and you’re kind of potential and acquisition target are you still kind of feeling like MarketAxess has a really strong growth potential to standalone and your primary focus is on kind of remain in that way.
Unidentified Company Representative: As you’ve today, we couldn’t be anymore excited about what we have going on organically. And the breadth of support that we have in the market with investors and dealers, and it’s an exciting time for the company to see the adoption rates accelerating in U.S. cash credit products to see the industry moving forward to electronic trading in CDS and to have really exciting new capabilities in Europe that we think will be part of the MarketAxess turnaround story there. So our focus continues to be on building our business organically.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander from KBW.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Hi, thanks for taking my question.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Niamh.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Hi. And congrats on the BlackRock Solution, I mean, I think we all we’ve got a shock when we saw the stock come down so much and some it supported because these are liquidity in this business is just challenging. And so clearly BlackRock Solution is changing its strategy a little bit to work with (inaudible) I think it’s a really it really commence the platform. On this (inaudible) I mean we have seen some pressure lines and even I talks a bit about competitor independent venue or maybe broke about getting some heightened market share around certain events and corporate events in the markets, is that something that you can compete with if they have a different model, more like a central limit order book, is that something how is your development of the central limit order book going thinking about rolling it soon?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, we’ve said in the past, we’re not at all surprise to see the increase in electronic trading in the credit space with such products vacation at the electronic share will be significantly higher in the future, its no surprise that the new competition is popping up, we are still not backed where we were, when we started when there is 60 platforms in the market that we are seeing some new venues and not at all surprising that dealers and investors are testing different protocols and trying to find liquidity solutions in a variety of different forms. I think ultimately, we still feel great about our competitive position and our strategy we think is the right one longer term, the independence of the platform allows us to work with all dealers and investors. Nothing that we’re doing excludes anyone from participating in any of our protocols. And, we have a wide menu of trading options. So, we are leveraging what we’ve done well over the last thirteen years in building the largest client, the dealer electronic trading network primarily in our core RFQ or auction protocol by building on top of that efficient new trading solutions that will allow new counterparties to trade with one another and create alternative sources of liquidity, so when you look across the range from RFQ to the success that we are already having in Market Lists we had client access live which allows passive indications of interest to rest in the system and as we announced yesterday, we’ve got our first launch of central limit order book capability in the CDS single name market. So we feel great about the network, we feel great about the trading protocols and we remain confident in our competitive position.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay, fair enough. And on the Xtrakter deal, it’s just closed, how [we] think about where most of the revenue will fall, is it more like the information services and less in the transaction side and then you already fewer weeks into it really, but I guess couple of months nearly, but what surprise you so far positively and negatively, it sounds like there is a bit of investing to do, you kind of recognize that before you bought it anyway, but you know what’s your initial thoughts with those.
Antonio L. DeLise: Niam, it is Tony. On the extractor side, first thing I’d say is that there is probably aren’t any real surprises, we did a fair amount of diligence around the before the acquisition, it seems to be well received by clients and by our buy-side clients also. So, there haven’t been really many surprises there. In terms of revenue expectations, this will be more, more near-term. We had talked a little bit on the fourth quarter call about a typical revenue run rate for extractor, it’s around $2 million per month, it’s all going to fall for 2013 likely also fall in that information and post trade services line. So that’s where the revenues will fall. Going forward though there is certainly an expectation that revenue synergies around new data products around additional trade matching opportunities, as the regulatory environment changes in Europe there is additional opportunities on the data side. So, we certainly expect to drive revenues forward in 2014 and beyond. But again for 2013 sort of a stable revenue run rate all falling in that information of post trade services line.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: And it’s going to be a nice boost to that business just because there have been some market share losses, would you say the management in the European team are kind of lot more upbeat now with kind of more after the work
Antonio L. DeLise: Yeah not, Niam if we look at how our employees have responded, this is collectively both here in the U.S. and in London and with the extractor team it’s nothing but positive vibes coming out of the acquisition. We plan on combining the group in London, where we will be moving physical states within the next four or five months combining one group in London will be combining and we will had a single data offering globally so there is, the fair amount of activity to what to get the two groups working together, and when we talk about Europe going forward it’s not while we’ll have different brands, it’s really not going to be talking about two different businesses, it will be one customer facing business in London.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay, fair enough. And then just lastly, I guess, I asked for the cash earlier, but have you think about your appetite you said focus on organic growth, but I still think there will be some really need to the retail, then you said would fit very well with your business and you have the cash I mean, help me think about your appetite to meet some acquisitions, some additional acquisitions if the right opportunity comes along and is there anything you’ve seen recently that you can’t really talk specifically to, but maybe get a sense of activity now versus your goal?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, I think that we’re really encouraged with the early signs with extractor and if we do find other acquisitions that fit with our core strategy as well as that one does, that are something that we would be very interested in and we have lots of capacity, we have excess capital on the balance sheet and no debt and public currency as well. So, it’s really all about sticking with our core strategy around building great solutions for electronic trading in the fixed income markets and that could include anything from data to other complementary e-trading venues to post trade services.
Niamh Alexander – KBW: Okay, fair enough. I’ll get back in the line. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates Inc: Hey, good morning guys.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates Inc: So, my first question, we’ve talked in the past about your addressable market in the high-grade space and as probably roughly 20% in the market, right. So you subtract that the block trades, subtract that from the dealer-to-dealer trades, and what you left was around 50%. How do you think about the addressable market in the high-yield and the emerging market space?
Richard M. McVey: I, we do a similar exercise there Patrick and where we really found that we’ve had success in high-yield is similar in that, it tends to be the smaller flow trade sizes, but it also tends to be in the higher credit quality, high-yield credits and issuers. And so, we don’t get to 50% of that market, when we look at it on that basis, we probably get to something that’s more like 25% or 30% of the market, but it’s a still a material step above where we are currently and lots of run way in front of us. In emerging markets it’s a little bit harder to be scientific, because we don’t have the benefits today of a TRACE state, but about half of the market is EM sovereigns where you would expect the market share to be higher and the other half is EM corporates. And I think, if you take a blended average of EM you probably come up somewhere in the same ballpark as you do for a high-grade corporates.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates Inc: Got you, understood. Thank you for that. Second question, a kind of on the same theme so our high-yield emerging market have been kind of to really good growth source for you in the last year or so. And what’s your reclassification today, I guess I am little bit surprised, because previously you kind of been somewhat masking the performance of those two groups with their AMC business, now you pulling out agency, but you are combining them with Eurobond business had not doing, entirely well. So, why not just more explicitly breakout what you think your market share is, what you think your revenue is from those products and help investors better understand the trends there?
Antonio L. DeLise: Sure. Patrick it’s a bit of balancing act. So we know there is a desire from the analyst and investor community from, for more granularity on the volumes and then our side, quite frankly we’re tying a limit information flow in some ways just for competitive reasons. And what happen to that in the prior volumes category to look at the all other bucket, they came a catch out for every product outside of Eurobonds and high-grade. And if you look back over time you look at the fluctuations in volumes and fee captured in that other category it was not easy to predict what was going on there. We have, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we re-grouped the volumes now to products with light liquidity characteristics and similar fee capture, we think it’s going to eliminate some of the variability in fee capture going forward. We also think it does, it’s a better grouping and scales a little bit better we can envision for example, when we starting reporting CDS index it would fall on to that liquid products category. So, we’re trying to balance these different constituencies and Patrick, we provided a fair amount of information, we’re on the call we provided information on how much emerging market and high-yield volume we’re doing, we’ve got a little more scientific on size of market I know we’re not getting all the way there, but I think we provided the tools to the track market share by product. If you make some of these assumptions and you look at that pie-chart on average daily volume, we’re giving you the information high-yield in the EM volumes. So, I don’t think it’s any less than what we’re providing and for us it’s a little better grouping.
Antonio L. DeLise: And just one follow on comment to that too Patrick, we have lot of the peer group that we can identify that’s involved in fixed income e-trading and our current view is that we’re leading the league in transparency and public information. If you disagree with that there is anything that you see out there that establishes best practices in a way better than we are, we’d love to know about it, but we think we’re more transparent than our competitors.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates Inc: I probably agree with that, certainly the exchanges provide a lot of product level detail, but compared to most of the other firms more in the same space, that your ten franchise is probably best in class, but it tells you better. Last question from me so, I think my take way on your partnership with BlackRock it seems like the biggest advantage to you is kind of distribution it gets you on there, front end Aladdin system makes it easier for their clients to trade on your platform. My question would be does that point out some sort of distribution flaws with your existing solution, is there something about how people currently trade on MarketAxess that, it’s a little bit tougher than it should be and so, Aladdin can result some of that, but maybe there is additional (inaudible) choppier?
Richard M. McVey: We have been the leader in innovation around workflow and ease of execution for credit for the last 13 years, but we can always get better and every quarter we’re working on enhancements front to back Patrick to make it easier for our clients to execute and easier for them to identify trading opportunities and trade matches. And I think working closely with Aladdin, we both believe that we can make it even easier for our combined clients, I quite honestly, I think that’s part of the value here the other is getting the support in market influence from BlackRock and Aladdin community, really behind our open trading initiatives and reducing the fragmentation that has been out there that is working against everyone’s objective to really create a more liquid market. And we couldn’t be more pleased to be working with BlackRock to really consolidate the attention around the market access solutions and really increase the efficiency and liquidity around the overall market.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy – Raymond James & Associates Inc: All right, gotcha, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugh Miller from Sidoti.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Hi, good morning
Unidentified Company Representative: Hello, Hugh
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning, Hugh
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Just had a couple of question that weren’t addressed, one of which is you gave us some detail on your expectations for market share for April, as I am taking a look at the trends for U.S. high grade, I mean it seems like we’re seeing some good growth in average daily volume up in the high single-digits year-over-year. I was wondering if could just talk about you know is that, is there anything you’re seeing that or is that just more of the function of the lack of holidays falling in April are relative to prior years?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, my personal view here and I don’t know if you’ve been seeing it in the other market structure companies that you follow. But I definitely think that there is a there has been a small impact from the early holiday schedule this year versus most years, where April is the holiday month. And if you look we do have more trading days now in April then we normally do and we are few less days in the first quarter. So, I do think that what has happened is a little bit of the normal March volume has shifted into April, where the second half of March in particular was slightly weaker than normal, but I would expect that what we’re seeing in the trace numbers reflects that has shifted into April.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: And you know Rick I believe you participated in a panel, a CDS panel last week and if just, if you could provide us some inside into you know the kind of core takeaways you had from that and any update you know as you are feeling for index and single-name time horizon for regulatory changes.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, happy to do both, the panel last week in DC was actually an SEC fixed income roundtable that was focused on bonds. So there were 4 panels down there during the day, two on the municipal bond market and two on the corporate bond market. And I was pleased to be invited to participate in the corporate bond panels, but from our perspective, in early days, the SEC is seeking industry input on many of the same issues that we saw emerge from Dodd-Frank for swaps with respect to looking at transparency, competition, liquidity, turnover, electronic trading trends in the bond markets in order for them to think about policy that might be beneficial to all market participants. With respect to other question on CDS, I think we and others have been frustrated with the pace, and we don’t have any reason to believe that the finalization of the rules is (inaudible) there seems to be an impasse on some fairly important differences in the final rule set, and we do not have anything to share with you today in terms of any expected dates from either the CFTC or the SEC.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay. Okay, and the last question I had was with regards to kind of the dynamics of the U.S. high-grade market and obviously there is tons of addressable room for market share growth, but I was wondering, your view point as you view the next couple of years here ahead. Is it kind of similar to your past view about grinding it out and seeing that kind of 100 to 200 or so basis point increase in market share or due foresee kind of the potential for the acceleration in that market share growth opportunity.
Unidentified Company Representative: We’ve always suggested that history is probably the right proxy for trying to estimate adoption rates and share gains in the future. The wild card here really is the introduction of new and exciting trading protocols that are giving clients and dealers different ways to engage electronically to complete both corporate bond and CDS trades. And that makes it more difficult to project the adoption rates and the share gains going-forward, but we are encouraged with some of the early take up signs and clearly if we can get multiple trading protocols and client communities contributing the share growth there is the possibility that we will see improved share gains in the future.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay, appreciate the insight, very helpful thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Howard Chen from Credit Suisse.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Hi, Good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hello, Howard.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Congrats on the quarter.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Rich, a follow up on the BlackRock Aladdin announcement, just at a high-level what specifically does this partnership provide you with that you didn’t have before?
Richard M. McVey: I think we both feel that this is a consolidation of efforts and BlackRock has been an early adaptor of electronic trading here and in other asset classes they have been a thought leader, they clearly felt a year-ago that the investment was well worth it, with their Aladdin client community attached some new matching protocols and learn from the experience and the biggest thing is we’re now taking everything that they’ve learned and the support that they have from their Aladdin clients and consolidating that with everything that we do. So, again it’s reducing the fragmentation that’s been out there and we think that the best thing is it’s going to increase the market focus and attention on one set of solutions and we’re fortunate that those are here at MarketAxess.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Understood, thanks. And then apologies if I miss this in the prepared remarks, but how was the dealer hit rate balance pressing this quarter and I guess that’s it.
Antonio L. DeLise: Yeah, so you know Howard, on the hit rates, yeah, they were slightly better in the first quarter, so if we look back over the prior four quarters in 2012 those hit rates for high-grade, we’re in the upper 60s ranging from 67% to 68%. First quarter we had a pretty good balance in the order book, so pretty good balance between bids and offers and that hit rate was up to around 73% and if you look at that market share increase year-over-year 11.4% Q1 of 2012, 12.3% Q1 of 2013 virtually all of that increase came from that higher hit rate.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Great thanks. And then my final question follow-up on the CDS opportunity I agree with you Rick, it’s really early days, but one drum beat that appears to be growing a bit as the potential futurization of credit trading products, so wanted to get your latest views on that as either a source of opportunity or concern?
Richard M. McVey: Yeah, we’re – we think that there is a place in the credit market for our CDS futures and unlike some of our competitors we’re actually big fans of expanding the market through our liquid futures instrument and our view is that the future's markets could provide a highly liquid way for new participants to trade credit at the top of the funnel which will benefit all parts of the credit market with more liquidity flowing through the single name market and even the corporate bond market. So we are not threatened by it, as you know we feel that our technology and network advantages are going to come through most clearly in the single name market and to the extend that we can build liquidity in another way through new participants that trade credit futures we think that’s a good thing for the overall market.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Great, thanks for the taking the questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). The next question comes from the line of Michael Wong, Morningstar.
Michael Wong – Morningstar: Good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hello Michael.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hello Michael
Michael Wong – Morningstar: Can you talk at the proposed European EM financial transaction tax affect the securities traded on your platform, and how your platform might fair compared to competitors if the transaction tax comes fast?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah, some of the proposed transaction taxes in various asset classes including bonds appear to be (inaudible) that ultimately if they were past in their current form we think would have a negative effect on overall market turnaround in the region. And as you can see Michael as on a relative basis today Euro bond trading is a smaller part of our business, and so the impact for us in the aggregate is not likely in the current position to be that significant, we clearly are in the process of investing more heavily in Europe to build a larger electronic trading business and at the margin, we would prefer not to see these transaction taxes go into place.
Michael Wong – Morningstar: Okay. Have you found any changes in the market now that the broker-dealers are growing their balance sheet a bit such as like does it take away volume from your platform or maybe did it contribute to the higher hit rate in the first quarter?
Richard M. McVey: Yeah, the dealer balance sheet did bounce back a little bit and as Tony mentioned, our hit rates are up a little bit. We still think that there is a liquidity challenge in the market overall. If you look at the amount of corporate debt outstanding in the U.S. market, it’s up about 50% since 2008. So there has been a huge increase in debt outstanding and a fairly significant overall decline in dealer balance sheets for market making, and that really calls out for new electronic solutions that are going to promote alternative sources of liquidity. And the other real win here is that when we look longer term, it appears that the long-term turnover rate of corporate debt is somewhere around 0.95 to 1 time per year. The turnover rate right now is the below 2008 turnover, it’s somewhere around 0.72 or 0.73. So if we are successful developing these new solutions to get turnover backup to the normal long-term averages, then TRACE volume overall would be significantly higher than it is currently.
Michael Wong – Morningstar: Okay. Really quick question; is $15 million to $18 million CapEx pretty good for the next several years or would you have a peak uptick building up the swap execution facility?
Unidentified Company Representative: Michael, I think that’s $15 million to $18 million. We typically don’t provide guidance beyond the current year, but just in the context of what’s going on this year, we do have one very big item identified. We’re building out another data center here in the U.S. it’s a replacement to our primary production data center, the [all in] cost is around $4 million we would not expect that to recur, so all things being equal without giving a specific guidance in longer term there is this one item in 2013 which I would call non-recurring.
Michael Wong – Morningstar: Okay thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks Michael.
Operator: We currently have no further questions in the queue. At this time I’d like to turn the call back to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Richard M. McVey: Thanks for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you again in next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference, this concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-01-30 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci – Investor Relations Rick McVey – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Tony DeLise – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets Niamh Alexander – KBW Hugh Miller – Sidoti Howard Chen – Credit Suisse
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 30, 2013. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. For the call Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter 2012 results. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year financial results, which show continued growth in revenues and earnings driven by market share gains in our core products. Revenues for the quarter were $50.4 million, up 12% from $45.1 million a year ago. Revenue growth was driven by record variable transaction fees, which were up 36% to $29.8 million from $22 million one year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.36, up from $0.29 last year. We achieved record estimated high-grade market share of 13.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 12.2% one year ago. We also saw another record quarter for combined emerging markets and high-yield volumes, which were up 66% year-over-year. We are pleased with the increased client participation in our open trading initiatives. During Q4, 39% of all investor inquiries on the system were placed into the Market Lists order book where both dealers and other investors can transact. We’re also on track to complete our acquisition of Xtrakter in Q1, and we remain enthusiastic about the combined capabilities we will be able to deliver to our European clients. Slide four displays some details on our quarterly results and financial strength. In 2012, we’ve once again achieved record annual revenues of $198.2 million, up 9% from $181.1 million in 2011. Our adjusted diluted EPS was up 17% to $1.41. EBITDA was up 11% to a record $95 million for the year, and operating and EBITDA margins were 44% and 48% respectively. Free cash flow was a record $71.2 million, up 22% from the prior year. Given our strong free cash flow and continued growth in earnings, our board of directors has declared an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.13 per share from $0.11 per share. This increase in the quarterly dividend follows our special dividend of $1.30 per share in December. Our cash and securities balance at December month-end was $180 million or $4.76 per diluted share. Slide five provides an update on market conditions. High-grade TRACE volumes were up 12% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 2012 full-year TRACE volumes were roughly in line with the previous three years at approximately $3 trillion. Flows into taxable bond funds also continue to be very strong with inflows of $60 billion in the fourth quarter. High-grade and high-yield corporate debt outstanding continues to grow rapidly. During 2012, corporate debt outstanding grew 5% and is now up 23% since the beginning of 2009. Primary dealer holdings of corporate debt for market making ended the quarter at $57 billion and continue to reflect balance sheet constraints due to new regulatory capital requirements. The growth in the overall corporate debt market and the decline of dealer market and the decline of dealer balance sheets creates the need for new electronic liquidity solutions in credit markets. Slide six summarizes the trading volume across our product categories. Overall global trading volumes for 2012 were $590 billion, up 12% from 2011. Global volumes in the fourth quarter were $149 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. U.S. high-grade volumes were $93 billion in Q4 2012, up 23% compared to the prior year quarter. Our increased volumes were due to a combination of market share gains and an 11% year-over-year increase in TRACE volumes. Investor order flow volume increased 13% and hit rates were fairly stable. Volumes on other product category increased 16% year-over-year to $48.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Emerging market and high yield volume growth was especially robust, up 66% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by market share gains. Eurobond volumes and volumes traded by European clients were flat in Q4 compared to the prior year. CDS volumes were roughly flat in Q4 from Q3 levels and well above prior year volumes. January TRACE volume is roughly on par with last January. Our month-to-date high-grade share in January is currently up from last January, but below Q4 levels. We are seeing a normal seasonal decline from the fourth quarter combined with a very active new issue calendar. EM and high-yield volumes in January are above the fourth quarter pace. Slide seven outlines a strategy for growing our European business. As mentioned in last quarter, we view Xtrakter as a strong fit with our core business and our strategic vision. Through the integration of the two companies, we believe we will have a highly compelling offering in Europe comprising unique pre-trade data, a broad range of electronic trading protocols, and valuable post-trade services. We are exploring opportunities to leverage Xtrakter’s extensive intraday and historical data to provide our dealer and investor clients with better tools to manage credit trading risk. We will work closely with the industry and regulators as new rules for trade price transparency move forward. We also expect to expand trade matching services as the industry prepares for T+2 trade settlement. We are expanding our open trading and dealer-to-dealer trade services into the European region to complement our core client-to-dealer RFQ trading. Forward integration of these trading solutions with Xtrakter data and post-trade services will better differentiate our European product offering. We still expect the acquisition to be EPS-neutral in 2013. However, even modest realization of potential data revenue synergies would drive valuable earnings accretion in 2014 and beyond. Slide eight outlines the opportunities for increasing market share in our core products. In our core client-to-dealer high-grade RFQ business, an 18% increase in investor order count in Q4 was the key driver of our record estimated market share. Block trading volume as a percentage of TRACE continues to decline, which we view as favorable for electronic trading growth. Investor adoption rates continue to improve our open trading initiatives. In addition to the increase in high-grade Market Lists orders, we also expanded Market Lists into high yield and emerging markets and rolled out Client Axes to a broader group of clients during the fourth quarter. While still a small part of overall volume, approximately 400 investor-to-investor trades were completed in the fourth quarter, up from 200 in the third quarter. We are pleased with the progress on dealer-to-dealer trading through DealerAxess. Q4 volumes on the platform were up 38% compared to the third quarter and almost 7,000 trades were conducted during the quarter. Now, let met turn the call over to Tony for additional detail on our financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide nine for some perspective on our full year results. A 25% increase in variable transaction fees was the driver behind the 9% overall revenue growth in 2012. High-grade emerging markets and high-yield market share gains accounted for the increase in variable transaction fees. Overall U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes were around $3 trillion marking the fourth consecutive year at this level. Expenses were up 9% in 2012, slightly above our five-year trailing average. We are investing more heavily to respond to market structure changes and the growing addressable market. In addition to our investment in Xtrakter, we increased our direct operating expenses and software development spend for new initiatives. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 17% and has now increased over six-fold since 2008. Slide 10 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $50.4 million were up 12% from a year ago driven principally by trading commission growth. Similar to the full year discussion, market share gains accounted for the majority of the commission increase. Total expenses were $28.9 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Fourth quarter expenses include Xtrakter acquisition related costs totaling almost $1 million. Pre-tax income was $21.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 14% from last year. The fourth quarter 2012 results include a non-recurring favorable income tax adjustment of $6.7 million or $0.18 per share related to certain acquired tax loss carry-forwards. Approximately one-half of the adjustment relates to the reversal of a previously-established tax reserve and the remainder relates to the recognition of additional tax loss carry-forwards to be used to reduce future income tax payments. Excluding this item, our effective tax rate for the full year 2012 was 38.5%. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.36 on 37.6 million diluted shares. Shares repurchased during the fourth quarter did not materially impact the diluted share count. On slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. U.S. high-grade fees per million were $193 in the fourth quarter consistent with the prior year level and down from $203 in the third quarter. The sequential drop in U.S. high-grade fee capture was principally due to a decline in years to maturity of bonds traded on our platform. The other product category fees per million were $232 in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from $166 a year ago and from $216 in the third quarter. Higher fee capture emerging market and high-yield volume accounted for the increase and represented 63% of the other product category volume in the fourth quarter compared to 47% one year ago and 60% in the third quarter. Distribution fees were $14.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, down 14% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and down slightly from the third quarter level. We currently expect that first quarter 2013 distribution fees will be consistent with the fourth quarter level. Slide 12 provides you with the expense details. Total expenses for the fourth quarter were $28.9 million, up 10% from a year ago. The full year 2012 expenses of $111.5 million were in line with the guidance we provided on the third quarter earnings call. The year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization reflects a significant capital software development and equipment spending in the past several years. The year-over-year and sequential increase in professional and consulting fees is attributable to the Xtrakter transaction costs and higher legal fees. We expect Xtrakter transaction cost to total $2.5 million of which approximately $1 million will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013. On slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale as of December 31, 2012 were $180 million compared to $248 million at year-end 2011 and $204 million at September 30, 2012. We’ve remained focused on capital management and returned a total of $140 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during 2012. Our recurring quarterly dividend remains an active part of our capital management priorities. We have now increased the quarterly dividend in three consecutive years. Last year’s share repurchases have been accretive to earnings and we have approximately $6 million in authorized capacity under our existing share repurchase program. Through our existing cash position, strong free cash flow generation, and new $50 million line of credit, we have the flexibility to meet our capital management priorities. There was no change in our capital structure during the fourth quarter and we continue to have no bank debt outstanding. On slide 14, we have our 2013 expense – capital expenditure and income tax rate guidance. Excluding the impact of layering on Xtrakter operating expenses, we expect that total 2013 expenses will be in the range of $118 million to $123 million. The midpoint in that range suggest an 8% increase in expenses. As Rick mentioned, we expect that the Xtrakter acquisition will close in the first quarter. Xtrakter’s monthly operating expenses are projected to be approximately $2 million inclusive of the amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets. Capital expenditures include computer software and equipment, capitalized software development cost, and datacenter build out cost. We expect the capital expenditures will be between $10 million and $13 million in 2013. We expect that the effective tax rate for the full year 2013 will be between 38% and 40%. Among other items, the mix of U.S. and foreign source income and change in income tax rates could cause variations in the effective tax rate. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Tony. The 2012 full year results show continued growth in trading volume, revenue and earnings in our core products. Our free cash flow is allowing us to make valuable investments in new electronic marketplaces at the same time that we are returning more capital to our investors through increased dividends and share repurchases. 2013 will be an important year to maintain growth in our core business while simultaneously investing in new long-term growth opportunities in Europe open trading and derivatives. We believe the investment areas will significantly increase our addressable market in the years ahead. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Hi, guys.
Rick McVey:  Hi, Jillian.
Tony DeLise:  Good morning, Jillian.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  So, one of the biggest unknowns I guess with respect to Xtrakter and how much data you are going to be able to supply, how soon, is that it depends on what the dealers in Europe are kind of comfortable with. So, just want to get a sense, I mean assuming you potentially been in dialogue with some of them now, you know, what incremental data you think you are going to be able to offer in 2013, you know, when that might phase in versus what’s kind of to come in 2014?
Rick McVey:  Sure, it’s an important point and the – our new Xtrakter colleagues are already working very closely with the dealer community on data initiatives through trading associations like AFME. And, you know, I think our goal will be to continue to work with dealer clients as we promote more data products in the European region. And I think, Jillian, as a starting point, there is very little controversy about providing better tools around historical trade data and also better real time data around the most liquid Eurobonds. So, I think that there is plenty of value that we can add along the way in working closely with that dealer community, providing the acquisition does close this quarter as we would expect, we will be working on those data initiatives immediately and we would expect that some of the new data products would to start to kick-in in the second half of this year.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay, that’s helpful. And then we’ve seen the 10-year treasury yield pickup pretty meaningfully in January and I know that that potentially negative or creates negative pressure on your high-grade fee rate. But I just wanted your thoughts on kind of where it could go in 2013? I mean, in the fourth quarter, yield was up by 4% and the fee rate was down 5%, but I don’t know it’s appropriate to kind of read too much into that correlation. So, may be you can just remind us on how we should be thinking about that relationship between those two?
Tony DeLise:  Jillian, its Tony. So, there is – first off there is lots of items or lots of factors that influence our U.S. high-grade fee capture. So, it’s not only duration, it’s not only years to maturity and yields, but also that dealer mix and specifically the execution fees from the all variable dealers, also trade size. We do have a tiered pricing plan, so the larger the trade, the lower the lower the fee. So, it’s not just duration necessarily, but nonetheless, we have seen yields pickup in the last 4 weeks to 6 weeks. Having said that when you look at absolute yield that the increase in the 10-year, for example, has been offset mostly by a tightening of spread. So, when you look at the absolute yield numbers, it really hasn’t changed all that much. For us, when we look at years to maturity, there is – and looking back for the last eight or nine years, we do see a pretty high negative correlation between the direction of yields and years to maturity. So for example, in a rising yield rate environment our years to maturity typically goes down and in a – when yields are declining years to maturity goes up. But when you look at the sensitivities around that it’s – years to maturity probably has the – is more of an influence as opposed to absolute yields. What you did see and what you did observe in the fourth quarter for us, you saw that U.S. high-grade fee capture was down around $10 per $1 million and most of that was around years to maturity, a decline in years to maturity as opposed to yield necessarily.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. That’s helpful. And then just one final one from me. There has been some discussion in the industry about what impact Dodd-Frank clearing implementation might have on buy-side holdings of corporate bonds. And I guess the concern is that firms may need to shift out of bonds into cash in order to be able to get the necessary high quality collateral proposed in March. So, I was just wondering if you could kind of run through what your expectations are? What are you hearing from your clients, and how you see the collateral crunch kind of impacting the corporate bond markets overall?
Rick McVey:  Yeah, I’m happy to address that. I think, Jillian, you might be referring to an article out in the FT about the potential impact on pension funds of the new collateral requirements for cleared swaps.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Yep
Rick McVey:  I do think a couple of things, our initial reaction to that is that -that’s mostly a European pension fund phenomenon less so in the U.S., as so many U.S. pension funds over the last 20 years have moved to defined contribution as opposed to defined benefit. So, in my opinion, the pension fund activity in the swap markets in the U.S. is a relatively small part of the overall market. And as a result, I wouldn’t expect that there will be a significant change there. It’s something to watch in Europe as the European swap markets move more towards central clearing. But in the grand scheme of things, we really do not expect that to be a significant change. The big macro factors really are the increase that we’re seeing in corporate debt and the increase in assets in credit markets that are coming not just from pension funds, but they’re coming from sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, so the market continues to get larger and most people expected that trend is likely to continue.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James:  Hey, good morning, guys.
Rick McVey:  Hello, Patrick.
Tony DeLise:  Hello, Patrick.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James:  So, kind of building off that last point, I think one of the big themes out there last few weeks has been kind of the expectation that we’re going to see kind of big shift of flows coming out of corporate bonds and back in to equities, and I think part of that field-related and part of that just kind of performance in the market. So, if we do see that shift, what sort of impact do you think you might see on your market share and on overall industry wide trading volumes?
Rick McVey:  Yeah. So far there’s not really any tangible evidence of that’s happening. If you look at the funds flows, they remain very healthy on the taxable fixed income side right through January. If there is a fund outflows and we haven’t seen that in the last three years or so, I would expect that that would come with a widening of corporate bond spreads. But remember, mutual funds, which is where we’re tracking the taxable bond fund flows, are only one component of the asset side of the corporate bond market. The insurance companies have been getting larger, as I mentioned, some of the sovereign wealth funds have been getting larger. So, there are other important flows beyond just the mutual fund flows.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James:  Okay. That’s helpful. Moving on to competition, certainly kind of a key risk that’s been talked about over the last few quarters has been the – the launch of kind of competitive electronic trading platforms. It seems like new one comes out every week or two. So, can you kind of talk about what sort of – what sort of reaction you think the marketplace has given to these new offerings, if they got any attraction so far, and kind of how you think that your open trading solution is stacking up against them?
Rick McVey:  Yeah, and I’d be happy to. Our information is all anecdotal, many of those newer initiatives to our knowledge are not really reporting activity on a regular basis. But I think they are finding that developing a new market place and getting institutional attention on those new solutions is a long process. And it’s – I think there are two things that the newer platforms are battling. One is the length of time to get market attention and traction on a new platform, and secondly, the large change in behavior that’s involved with promoting some of the investor-to-investor matching solutions. And what we’re seeing is that I think we have a couple of advantages. We have an installed – very large base of institutional investors and dealers already on the MarketAxess system and we have a large base of order flow already taking place through our traditional core products. So, adding on to that, some of the open trading solutions in our opinion, is an easier path than trying start something new from scratch. I also think that as you’re aware, Patrick, that some of the new solutions are promoted by single dealers or single clients or small groups of clients. And I continue to believe that independents and a large installed network both provide a large competitive advantage where we’re able to offer these services to all dealers and investors as opposed to a subset of the credit markets. So, while we are gaining traction in our Market Lists, today client-to-client trades that can be cleared through any dealer on the system are still a small part of overall volume. But again anecdotally we believe that the traction that we’re seeing in those initiatives is greater than anything else that’s taking place competitively.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James:  Okay, that’s fair. And then I guess to push on the last point that you’re talking about. So, slide eight I think kind of showed a nice chart of what percentage of your inquiries were actually utilizing the Market Lists functionality. Looks like it was up to 40% in the fourth quarter and yet I think the number of match client-to-client on trades was 400, if I heard that correctly. So, does that kind of suggest that it’s just really, really hard to cross client trades and it’s just always going to remain the dealer-driven market or is there something that is that 40% goes up to 60% and 80%, you’re going to start to see more hits across the client-to-client space?
Rick McVey:  I think it’s actually something a little bit different, Patrick. This is an enormous behavioral change for investment managers. In fixed income, for all of our careers the trading process has always been investment managers in the buy side asking for competitive quotes from dealers either by phone or electronically and the dealers are the ones that make prices. With the constraints on the dealer balance sheets now and the limited capacity that they have for market making what investors are contemplating is a new market structure that requires that they be price makers. And I think what you’re seeing is that they acknowledge that they need to go there, which is why the order flow on Market Lists is growing virtually every month. But they’re not yet positioned at the other end to put a price on an inquiry or bond in a normal 3 minute, 4 minute, 5 minute corporate bond inquiry. But we see them taking steps to change that because ultimately if they’re going to be part of the solution to get turnover levels back up in corporate bonds, they’re going to have to be in a position where they can respond and make prices rather than just inquiring on prices. And this is why, I think it is going to be a very important part of the new market structure and the new liquidity model, but I also think it’s going to be a multi-year process in terms of changing that behavior so that investor-to-investor transactions can be part of the liquidity solution.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James:  All right. Thank you. And I’ll jump back in the queue.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander with KBW. Please proceed.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Hi, thanks for taking my question.
Rick McVey:  Hello, Niamh.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Hi, how are you? Good morning. Quick questions on the rate card, especially in the other line, because that just keeps marching north. It was like 40% up year-on-year, up 7%. You’ve had a real beneficial shift of the mix there. I’m just wondering, how should we think about – could it be another 40% higher this time next year or are we kind of getting towards now where that lower fee agency mix is kind of small enough that we shouldn’t see this kind of an increase?
Tony DeLise:  Niamh, on the – on that other fee capture, it really is driven by the mix within that category. So, we haven’t seen any appreciable shift in the fee capture for the individual products. So, between – emerging markets, high-yield, agencies, the three main products, the fee capture individually hasn’t changed. It’s just that we have a situation where EM and high-yield are growing significantly. Rick mentioned 66% year-over-year. Full year EM and high-yield were up over 40%. And on the flip side, we have agencies where a combination of two things, now you’ve got overall TRACE agency volumes, for example, in the fourth quarter were down – were down something north of 12% in the fourth quarter. And then our market share has stagnated on the agency side. So, our market share has been flat lined for the last five or six quarters on the agency side. This is just not – when you look at the yield in agencies right now, our clients aren’t very active in that market. Could that continue? As Rick mentioned we think we – that – those trends in high-yield and emerging markets will continue whether or not we can generate another 40%-plus increase in the absolute fee captured. It’s going to be depended on that mix. If you’ve got the same dynamics with EM and high-yield market share growing and agency volumes flat lined, it’s possible.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  But if – I guess where I’m going, Tony, is that if the agency volume is a small enough portion of it now that if you don’t change your fees, all else equal, you don’t have as much upside in the fee. That gives the agency which is small enough, but it sounds like it’s still a big enough part that if this stagnates and the other still grow then you’re still more upside to the fee capture.
Tony DeLise:  Yes. And even look at the – look at the fourth quarter, agency volume was still almost 40% of the fourth quarter, so.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Of the other revenue, right?
Tony DeLise:  Of the other revenue, right.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Okay.
Tony DeLise:  So, if you look at the volume, it is almost 40%. So, it’s still a pretty sizable percentage of that other volume.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for that. And then I guess just on the credit derivatives, on the SEF, we have – I guess the regulators keep pushing back the timetable. Is it realistic now enough to just model much of any revenue this year for that or should we think about maybe you starting to report volumes on the credit trading that you’re seeing – revenue at some point this year.
Rick McVey:  Yeah, it’s a good question. It certainly has been a moving target, the CFTC and we and others are meeting them regularly. We continue to say that they are on the verge of finalizing the SEF rules. As you know they said they would had hope to get them out by the end of last year. They missed that deadline. We know that there are active discussions going on with the commissioners on the open items. And they continue to say that they – they have those SEF rules finalized this quarter. We would expect that the implementation period for SEF rules on CDS index swaps will probably be somewhere around four months to six months. So, it is possible that we would be in that new SEF regulatory regime sometime in the second half of this year. On the other hand, even as you know, an important component of the regulatory change, we have heard very little from the SEC and there are some important changes taking place there. So, it would be harder to predict at this point when the SEC will finalize the single name CDS rules.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Okay, fair enough. And that from our perspective is very important because if the index is look increasingly like they migrated to futures then it’s – is it fair to think that the single name is more Europe target market area?
Rick McVey:  Both are our target areas and we’re offering electronic trading in index products as well as single name and now options on indices as well. So, we think we have a comprehensive solution. But we would also agree with you that when you look at our strengths in corporate bond trading, it may worthwhile be that our competitive advantages are going to come through most clearly in single name CDS. But a lot of unknowns there in terms of CDS – the potential for CDS index futures, how that affects the OTC index market and the timing of the final regulations.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Okay. Thanks, Rick. I appreciate it. And then just last two. One, central limit order book, I’m curious as to maybe why you’re building one out and kind of progressing just given the liquidity in that market. It’s just help me think about what products or maybe what portion of the market do you think would end up kind of trading with streaming, liquidity in a CLOB. And then secondarily, well, it’s not related, but it’s, with regards to balance sheet, you said you have quite a lot of cash, you have the deal to close, but it seems to me after the credit agreement you have in place too, you have some capacity for deals. So, some more deal. So, help me think about your appetite, your interest, management’s time capacity given that you have to integrate Xtrakter as well? Thanks.
Rick McVey:  Those are two very different questions. So, I will take the crack at the first one and then Tony can talk about capacity on the capital management and cash, but just to be clear and your question on central limit order book, was that relating to the CDS markets or the bond markets?
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Bond market. Am I understanding correctly that you are thinking about rolling one out in the bond market?
Rick McVey:  We are, and I think we’ve got some of the key ingredients coming together in terms of live pricing that’s increasingly coming in from dealers albeit and smallest trade sizes and significant interest that is beginning to develop both on the buy-side and the sell-side. And our view is that the trading solutions will not be one size fits all, which is why we really like our strategy of having a menu of trading protocols ranging from our core client to dealer RFQ to multi-dealer streaming to Market Lists and Client Axes and also part of that equation will be a central limit order book. And we think depending on the liquidity the instrument and the size of the trade, there are merits to each of those solutions. And that technology is largely ready to go. We are talking with our clients about how they would like – how and when they would like to see that rolled out, but we would continue to expect it during the course of this year a central limit order book will be part of the menu of choices on the MarketAxess system.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Well, that’s interesting. Is it kind of – is it kind of a sub-10% of the market right now that you think could get to high and enough liquidity?
Rick McVey:  I think if you look at the top 20 or 30 corporate bonds, they do represent a higher percentage of overall trade than what you’ve outlined. As the market starts moving toward an open central limit order book model, the potential there could be greater. And I don’t think that we’re trying to predict with perfect foresight, how the market will adopt a different trading protocols, but we do see consensus among investors and dealers that the market needs to embrace more open trading protocols. The decline in turnover in the credit markets is negative for investors and dealers and it’s highly unlikely that the primary dealer balance sheet capacity is going to change and improve anytime in the near-term. So, we feel that we have an obligation to the market to continue to innovate and provide those technology solutions and we are being very responsive to our clients in terms of the different protocols that they think could be part of that solution.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Rick.
Tony DeLise:  Niamh, on the capital management question. Just, first taking a step back, I mean we did return $140 million of capital to shareholders in 2012 including the $50 million special dividend in December. And we expect to fund the Xtraker acquisition, which at today’s exchange rates will be something like $40 million and we’ll do all of that without borrowing any money. Second, as you observe, we still have a sizable cash position. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2012. And when we look at our capital management priorities, we think we can meet all of our capital management priorities within the context of that cash position and our free cash flow generation. And those priorities haven’t changed and we’ve talked about them in the past, it’s regulatory and working capital including any SEF working capital requirements or SEF regulatory capital requirements. Its new initiatives like CDS and open trading and dealer-to-dealer, it’s a dividend which we have in place, share repurchases and selective acquisitions as well. On the dividend side, you saw that we increased the dividend. That’s an important part of our capital management program. The board did take a look at the dividend level and still felt comfortable around the target of paying out around a third of free cash flow. If you look back over time that recurring quarterly dividend has – the increase in that recurring quarterly dividend has just about matched the increase in our recurring cash flow. So, if you look at our recurring cash flow from 2009 to 2012 that almost doubled. If you look at the recurring dividend now, that’s almost doubled as well. On the buyback side, we still have some capacity left under the $35 million program that the board authorized back in the fourth quarter of 2011. We repurchased some shares in the fourth quarter of 2012. We’ve got a 10b5-1 grid in place. We’re buying back on a price-sensitive basis against that grid. So, it’s still, both repurchases and dividends are an active part of the discussion with the board, an active part of our capital management program. Things like acquisitions, we’ve got the capacity with again with the cash, with our free cash flow, and now with the added capacity with the line of credit, we do have some increased flexibility there. If there is an acquisition with the same sort of characteristics and great fit that we think Xtrakter has, if something like that comes along, we’ve got the capacity to active in an opportunistic way. So we feel pretty good about the – about our financial position and the ability to respond opportunistically.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Sidoti. Please proceed.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti:  Good morning.
Rick McVey:  Hello, Hugh. How are you?
Hugh Miller – Sidoti:  Good. Good. Just – I guess I had a follow-up question on the behavioral shift you guys are talking about amongst institutional investors becoming more price makers. And I was wondering as you think about that, and obviously you mentioned it’s going to be a multi-year type of change, but what do you guys need to do to help really facilitate that? Are you developing any additional analytical tools that these investors can then use to become more comfortable and making markets. How do you view that kind of shift?
Rick McVey:  Yeah, good question, and I think there are a number of steps in that. The first step is to make a larger percentage of order flow available to a larger group of market participants. And I think if you look at the last two quarters, we feel pretty good about step one, moving from what was about 15% of order flow going into the Market Lists, in the second quarter the 40% in the fourth quarter, I think demonstrates real progress in broadening the reach of where that order flow goes and who can participate on the other side. The second part, Hugh, I think is doing anything we can to provide quality real-time data products, broadly to the marketplace. We’ve done that in the U.S. with our Bond Ticker products. We hope to move in the same direction again working alongside the industry in Europe with the new data capabilities that we have with Xtrakter. And there are also other industry solutions around data products, not just for bonds that have traded but on a model approach for bonds that may not have traded during the day. So, providing those tools is a critical part. We’re also continuing our client outreach on alternative market makers that may start to come from – increasingly from the growth in the ETF market making community, some people that have been active making markets electronically in other asset classes that are now looking at credit. So, doing everything we can to enable that community to participate in core credit part products is also a part of the solution.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti:  Okay. Appreciate the insight there. And, obviously, you commented about the timetable and what your view index CDS trading and so I would suspect that the resignation of CFTC Commissioner Sommers really wouldn’t have that much of an influence assuming that does remain on that timetable for 1Q. But does that dynamic play a factor longer term at all with regards to your opportunities for CDS trading for index?
Rick McVey:  We don’t get any sense that the overall direction of regulatory reform for derivative trading is changing. It’s just that the timetable keeps moving out. And I don’t think one commissioner is likely to change that path. And as you point out Commissioner Sommers, as I understand it, is said be there until April and by all accounts, they expect to get through the first round of SEF rules while she is still there. So, I think that the trend is still in place on promoting more transparency and competition in electronic execution and swaps and the open question is when will the rules be implemented.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti:  Okay, and the last question I had, you provided a little bit of color on potential from market share in January. I was wondering if you could just – if you happen to have any detail on what you’ve seen duration due of the bonds traded on the platform so far in January relative to 4Q, just given some of the shifts we have seen in the yield curve.
Rick McVey:  Hugh, it’s – it’s one month into the quarter right now. But just in terms of January, nothing appreciable has changed there in terms of years to maturity. And even when you look at things like TRACE volume, the dealer-to-dealer mix, and block trades, really nothing all that appreciable, even in the broader context that way.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti:  Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse:  Hi. Good morning, Rick. Good morning, Tony.
Rick McVey:  Hello, Howard.
Tony DeLise:  Hello, Howard.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse:  Rick, you touched on the broader theme of constrained dealer balance sheets, but we did see that first meaningful upward inflection in corporate balance sheets during the quarter. So, I’m just wondering, one, how do you think that impacted hit rates if at all. And then two, if that trend continues, does that signal anything meaningfully for you?
Rick McVey:  You’re right. We’ve had a small bounce off of a low of about $40 billion in the aggregate primary dealer balance sheets for corporate bonds. But in the context of those balance sheets declining from $250 billion to $40 billion and bouncing to $57 billion, I still think it reflects a significant change in dealer capital available for market making. And I – as far as early signs this year, we’re getting very active, very active new issue calendar in January. It looks like we will come in well above last January. And during those periods, obviously, the underwriters are very involved not only in distributing the new issues, but also doing swap trades with their clients that over the short-term can cause increases in the balance sheets. But I think that increase is largely irrelevant versus the large trend of the deleveraging that’s taken place over the last three years.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse:  Understood, thanks. And then one of the other secular trends you’ve noted over the last few years, Rick, is smaller trade sizes. So, could you just update us on how that’s progressing from everything that you can see?
Tony DeLise:  Howard, on the – what we’re tracking and talk about most frequently is the block trade size and block trade percentage of TRACE in. You look back now over the last three quarters, it’s been right around 38% or 39%. So, it has dipped significantly in the past two years. It dipped significantly from the first quarter of last year. But it’s hovering around that 38% or 39% for Q2, Q3 and Q4. So far in January at least that we can observe – yet to be finalized over these next couple of days, it looks like it’s around 40% or 41%. It doesn’t surprise us necessarily given the very healthy new issue calendar. But think about at least for January to date, you’re right around that 40% range.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse:  Right. That makes sense in the context of what Rick just said. And then switching over to expenses, on that 8% expected expense growth midpoint, can you just help us, Tony, bucket that expense to maybe; one, incremental investment spending; two, any higher comp accrual given what you’re expecting for core franchise growth; and then three, I guess, other buckets that first two wouldn’t encapsulate?
Tony DeLise:  Sure, sure. So, on the prepared remarks we mentioned, guidance excluding Xtrakter of $118 million to $123 million, midpoint was around 8% increase. And that’s pretty close to this historical growth rate. If you look back from 2007 to 2012, it’s probably right in that 8% range. But when you look at the absolute dollar increase from 2011 for argument sake, it’s $9 million or $10 million, as expected most of that in comp and benefits. If you look at 2012, around 55% of our expenses were comp and benefits related. It’s a similar sort of what that we’re expecting in 2013. Most of the headcounts growth over where we are today would come in those new initiative areas around CDS and dealer-to-dealer open trading, it’s not only sales and product management people, but on the development side as well. So, still think about the bucketing that the comp and benefits piece of it is still the lion’s share of our expenses and will grow similar to that 8% overall rate. There is – if I look at the numbers right now, there is probably two big variables that you should think about, and one of them is known and that’s just that our incentive bonus provision is tied directly to operating performance that rolls up into comp and benefits because it’s tied to operating performance. There is some variability or sensitivity in that one. So that – that could swing up or down. The other one from a variable nature would be around SEF compliance and surveillance build out cost. Until these rules are finalized, there are some items we haven’t committed to. So, the timing of that spend is a little sensitive right now. Clearly, we’re still in investment mode. We’re still committed to investing in all of these new initiatives around D2D and CDS and open trading. So, clearly we’re still in investment mode. I’d say – I’ll just give you two other – two other little anecdotes just in terms of individual line items. When you look at depreciation and amortization, despite look at your model just because of the big spend we’ve had in 2012, the big spend that we’ve guided to in 2013, that line item would probably will increase more than the 8% overall. And on the flip side, professional and consulting fees, there were some items in there in 2012, that item will not grow as much as the overall expense growth. So, just in terms of individual line items, again think about comp and benefits, lion’s share of our expenses growing similar to the overall expense, depreciation up a little bit more, professional and consulting probably down a little bit.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse:  Great. That’s really helpful, Tony. And maybe just a final follow-up perhaps like a more philosophical one for you Rick, how do you think about budgeting for variable compensation going into a year while you seem pretty constructive, earnings grew 32% and have grown in excess of 40% CAGR over the last five, six years. Are you generally budgeting for sustaining those growth rates?
Rick McVey:  I guess the couple of questions there. I think its relating to comp and benefits, and if you look at comp and benefits especially our cash bonus accrual for 2012, Howard, what you will see is even though earnings were up, I think we’ve reported 17% today, the cash bonus accrual for employees was roughly flat. So, we do build in typically with our comp committee and our board, a baseline level of growth to maintain existing levels of comp. And if we exceed those levels of growth, then employees will participate in those – in the upside and if you don’t the bonus provision will be lower. So, certainly if you look at the last four years, the increase in comp and benefit and bonus expenses is well below the increase in earnings that you’ve cited.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse:  Yeah, got it. Congrats on a strong year.
Rick McVey:  Thank you.
Tony DeLise:  Thanks, Howard.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) You have a follow-up question from the line of Patrick O’ Shaughnessy. Please proceed.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James:  Hey, a follow-up question I have for you was just kind of strategically thinking, what is your view of the retail corporate bond business. Obviously, you guys are really big in institutional business, but how appealing would you find the retail business and what sort of synergies do you think it could extract by combining the retail and institutional business?
Rick McVey:  Yeah, we said consistently, Patrick, as you know that we view that part of the fixed income business as complementary to what we do today. And there are four or five established retail e-trading networks in the market today. So we’ve said it would be more likely that if we decide to enter that space, we would do so through an acquisition or a joint venture of sorts. We believe in credit retail represents something like 7% or 8% of volume, but typically at higher margins. And for the smallest trade sizes as we move towards a world of open trading, it is possible that combining retail liquidity with various small tickets in the institutional world would provide some of the synergies that you mentioned. Quite honestly, we are starting down that path and we’re doing it through our dealer-to-dealer initiative. If you look at a lot of what we do in the dealer-to-dealer space, it is the smaller trade sizes, where large dealers are using MarketAxess to more actively manage their balance sheets and distribute smaller tickets even if that means distributing them out to other dealers. And often times those other dealers are retail trading desk. So, if you look at the number of dealers that are active in D2D, it’s a far greater number than we have market making in our institutional core products. And the way we think about that is that D2D business is actually already starting to pull retail liquidity into our institutional business. So, we’re starting down that path. It’s a margin we think it would be additive to what we do. Obviously, we don’t talk about it along with five main initiatives that we’ve discussed today. It’s not the same level of priority for the firm, but if the right opportunity comes along to extend what we’re doing in the retail space, we certainly would look at it.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy – Raymond James:  All right. That’s very helpful. Thanks again.
Operator:  We have a follow-up question from the line of Niamh Alexander. Please proceed.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  I’ll be very quick. Market share of January so far and what can you share with us. And then just on Xtraker, what is it at this point, is it just regulatory approval. Should we think about maybe end of first quarter, just helping us from the modeling perspective. Thanks.
Rick McVey:  Yeah. We gave a small clue on January volumes, but recognize the range between last January and the fourth quarter shows relatively wide. But suffice to say in January overall levels of activity are attractive. We are above the average daily the volume over the entire system on where we were in the first quarter of last year. So the overall level of activity is quite attractive. What we’re seeing in the very near-term, Niamh, over the first three weeks or so of the year is slightly lower than expected market share in high-grade and better than expected results again in high-yield and EM, so a little bit of a mixed bag...
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Okay.
Rick McVey:  But the overall levels of activity are attractive.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks. And then on the Xtrakter, just on the timing?
Rick McVey:  Yeah, that’s – we are waiting for FSA approval. The range of dates that they gave us is anywhere between around now and the middle of March would be their normal cycle on approving a transaction like this. So we continue to expect at sometime in the next four to six weeks, we will have their approval, we will be able to move forward to close on Xtrakter.
Niamh Alexander – KBW:  Okay, great. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.
Operator:  You have a follow-up question from the line of Jillian Miller. Please proceed.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Thanks. Just have a couple of really quick – number of questions. How much Xtrakter related stuff was in the professional fees line, was it $1 million or $0.5 million?
Tony DeLise: So, Jillian, the – for the fourth quarter there were two Xtrakter related expenses on two different lines. And to be specific, there was around $700,000 in the professional and consulting.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay.
Tony DeLise:  And there was around $300,000 in the other expense. So those two tallied up to about $1 million.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. And that $700,000 should be moving to $1 million next quarter?
Tony DeLise:  Right, right. So in the first quarter when the deal closes, there is some investment banking fees. There is some other legal and tax related fees. And as Rick mentioned, we are hopeful here the Xtrakter transaction will close soon, and when it does, we expect that $1 million – and that will all be on the professional and consulting line, that will hit in the first quarter.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. And then is there any reason to think that the tax rate would for some reason be higher next year than it was this year at 38.5%, because I know you’ve guided 38% to 40%, but it seems like anything more and more of your revenue is kind of coming from Europe. So maybe just a little bit more guidance there?
Tony DeLise:  Sure, sure. Two things on the tax rate and one of them related to this tax adjustments, but just to be clear on that one time non-recurring tax adjustment, that will not influence the expected tax rate going forward. So I don’t want anybody to be confused or model in something on that one time adjustment. And then in terms of the guidance range of 38% to 40%, if you look back now over the last three years, we’ve been right between 38% and 39.5% or so, the last three years now. But I will say, if we – if more of our income is sourced from our international operations that could drive down our effective tax rate. Right now looking at our projections for 2013, we still think – take a look at what we just reported for 2012, that’s a pretty good proxy for what we’re expecting right now in 2013.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay, that’s helpful. And then just finally, on the guidance of $118 million to $123 million for expenses, I know you guys have said before that there was going to be like investments you had to make related to Xtrakter and kind of growing that business. So, I know that it doesn’t include the like actual Xtrakter operating expenses, but does it include projected investments to grow that business after it closes? Does that make sense?
Tony DeLise:  So, Jillian, right now – and it was – yeah, we had a lot of debate on how to report Xtrakter. And given the fact that there is some uncertainty on the exact closing date, we opted to tell you what we expect the monthly spend to be. So, post acquisition, we’re expecting that monthly Xtrakter-related spend to be around $2 million. That would be inclusive of the expected investments we make – we expect to make around technology and that includes people, systems, infrastructure. It includes – there is some – we’ll be hiring some shared services positions, which previously were provided by EuroClear. We’ll be hiring in new position. So, that $2 million per month would be inclusive of all of those sorts of investments.
Jillian Miller – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator:  I’ll now turn the call over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-02 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded November 2, 2012.
 I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. 
David Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then, Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results.
 Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company’s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.
 For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website.
 Now, let me turn the call over to Rick. 
Richard McVey: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2012 results. Earlier this morning, we’ve reported third quarter results, which show records in a number of areas. Despite software overall market volumes during the quarter, revenues were up 4% to $48.3 million driven by an 18% increase in variable transaction fees.
 Diluted EPS improved to a record $0.36 compared to $0.34 one year-ago. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share reached a record level of 12.5%, compared to 11.6% in the third quarter of 2011. Combined emerging markets and high-yield volumes were up 35%, compared to a year-ago and reached a new quarterly record.
 CDS volume was up 51% sequentially and represented our best quarter ever for CDS trading volume. We are increasing our investment in Europe. Earlier today we announced that we have agreed to acquire Xtrakter Limited from Euroclear. Xtrakter will expand our regulatory transaction reporting, fixed income trade matching and data services for European clients.
 Slide 4 displays some details on our quarterly results and financial strength. We are investing heavily in new markets and technology solutions that expand our future opportunity set. In spite of these investments, we continue to report growth in operating income and EBITDA. September year-to-date EPS was $1.05 up 14% from $0.91 in the same period in 2011, and year-to-date EBITDA is $71.2 million.
 Free cash flow was over $61 million for the trailing 12 months, and our cash and securities balance at September month end was $204 million or $5.44 per diluted share. Our strong cash flow and cash balances will allow us to complete the Xtrakter acquisition from existing cash balances.
 The board has approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share. In addition, during the quarter, we made some modest share repurchases pursuant to our existing share repurchase plan.
 Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. New issuance volume strengthened in the third quarter from softer levels in the second quarter. TRACE volumes have also bounced back strongly in September and October after a weak month in August. We currently expect full-year TRACE volumes to be around the same level as the last 3 years.
 Taxable fixed income fund inflows continue to be very strong due to the search for yield and favorable asset class diversification.
 The impact of the dealer balance sheet constraints continues to be visible in the decline in block trading as a percent of overall high-grade TRACE volume. Block trades represented 38% of total trades volume in the third quarter, down from 43% in Q3 of 2011. We view this trend as favorable for our business, since we typically had a higher market share in smaller non-block trade sizes.
 Slide 6 summarizes the trading volume across our product categories. Overall, global volume in the third quarter was up 5% year-over-year to $138 billion. Q3 high-grade TRACE volumes were down 2%, compared to a year ago, and down 6% sequentially. The 5% increase in our U.S. high-grade volume to $86 billion was due solely to the market share improvement. Growth in investor orders was the principle driver of the market share gain. Hit rates especially for investor buy orders declined during the quarter reducing overall high grade market share gains.
 Eurobond volumes were down 21% from the third quarter of 2011 to $6 billion. In spite of the regional softness in Eurobond trading, our cross regional business from European investor clients into emerging markets and U.S. high-grade bonds grew 23% from the prior year period. Combined volume from European investors is flat versus the year ago period.
 Other product category volumes were up 9% from the third quarter of 2011 to $46 billion in the third quarter of 2012. Combined emerging markets and high-yield volumes increased 35% from the third quarter of 2011 to a new quarterly record. We believe these gains were primarily due to market share gains as high-yield TRACE volume was down 2% versus the prior year period. As you may recall, we are not reporting CDS volume in our monthly volume release. However, CDS volume was up 51% sequentially from the second quarter and reached a new quarterly record.
 Overall, October volumes were negatively impacted by Hurricane Sandy and a lack of trading on Monday and Tuesday of this week. Excluding those 2 days, our total average daily trading volume was similar to the very strong results in September. October estimated U.S. high-grade market share was in line with September while EM and high-yield average daily volumes hit new records.
 Slide 7 gives an update on our new initiatives. We remain focused on expanding our U.S. high-grade market share. We believe that structural changes in the credit markets caused by regulatory reform will drive electronic market share higher in credit markets. We are focused on growing investor order flow and expanding our electronic trade matching solutions, less block trading and smaller trade sizes are already increasing demand for electronic trading.
 Our dealer-to-dealer platform continued to gain traction in the third quarter. D-to-D high grade volume increased 49% from the second quarter with 58 different dealers trading. We will roll out additional functionality for the D-to-D market in the coming quarters.
 Our open trading solutions are designed to increase trade matching opportunities between investors. Investors submitted 22% of orders to the market list open order book during the quarter and October will show another significant increase. While still a small part of overall trading volume, investor trade matches are growing through market lists. We recently launched our client access functionality to allow clients to anonymously post indications of interest alongside dealer inventory. We have the technology ready for essential limit order book if investor and dealer demand grows for live trading.
 Slide 8, provides an overview of the Xtrakter business in the acquisition rational. Earlier this morning, we announced that we will acquire Xtrakter Limited from Euroclear. Xtrakter is a market leader in regulatory transaction reporting, fixed income post trade matching and market data services.
 We are very excited about the opportunities presented by this acquisition. Xtrakter’s business is highly complementary with MarketAxess and will provide us with an expanded set of technology solutions for European clients. The Xtrakter business serves over 200 dealers and other institutional market participants in Europe currently. The acquisition will more than double our European revenues and employees.
 Upcoming European market regulations including MiFID II, will increase demand for trade reporting and industry moves toward T+2 settlements will increase the demand for trade matching solutions. We expect to register Xtrakter as an Approved Publication Arrangement or APA and we will work with the industry on the upcoming requirement for a consolidated trade tape for fixed income. We believe that these data in post trade services represent an ideal fit with our existing electronic trading and data capabilities.
 Our value proposition for clients is driven by real-time data, electronic trading and straight-through processing tools. We believe that the acquisition of Xtrakter represents an important step to deliver a unique front to back electronic trading service including real-time data, electronic trading, regulatory transaction reporting and trade matching services for the European financial markets.
 Now, let me turn the call over to Tony, to provide some financial details on the Xtrakter transaction and our third quarter financial performance. 
Antonio DeLise: Thank you, Rick. On Slide 9, we have summarized some financial highlights for the Xtrakter transaction. The purchase price is GBP26 million in cash. Together with approximately GBP2 million in transaction costs, the total cost of the acquisition is estimated to be around US$44 million. Closing of the transaction is continued on obtaining regulatory approval from the UK financial services authority and satisfaction of other customary conditions.
 We are working through the regulatory approval process and currently expect to complete the transaction in the first quarter of 2013.
 Xtrakter’s 2011 actual and 2012 projected revenues are both approximately $24 million. We expect that near-term revenues will be consistent with this run rate and that new opportunities to expand trade matching and data services would be realized in 2014 and beyond.
 We expect the acquisition to be approximately neutral to earnings per share in 2013, including the impact of the amortization of intangibles and the opportunity cost of funding. We do expect to make certain software, hardware and infrastructure technology investments over the next several years and that revenue synergies would drive accretion into 2014.
 Slide 10 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $48.3 million were up 4% from a year ago, principally due to an 18% increase in variable transaction fee commissions, offset by lower distribution fees and lower technology products and services revenues. The year-over-year decline in technology products and services revenues was largely due to lower professional services fees. We narrowed our areas of focus and made some professional services headcount adjustments during this year.
 Total expenses were $27 million, up 11% in the third quarter of 2011 and down 2% sequentially from the second quarter. I will touch on the expense variance versus 2011 momentarily. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 36.4%. The year-to-date effective tax rate is now 39.2%, compared to 39.6% last year.
 During the third quarter, we benefited from a state income tax apportionment methodology refinement. The impact of this change in estimate related to prior years amounted to approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Our diluted EPS was $0.36 on $37.5 million diluted shares. Shares repurchased during the third quarter did not materially impact the diluted share counts.
 On Slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and in fees per million. Distribution fees were $14.6 million during the third quarter of 2012, down 10% from the third quarter of 2011 and consistent with the second quarter level. The year-over-year decline resulted from the first quarter 2012 distribution fee reduction on our major euro bound fee plan.
 We currently expect that fourth quarter distribution fees will be consistent with the third quarter level. U.S. high-grade fee per million were $203 in the third quarter, up from $189 in the third quarter of 2011 and consistent with the second quarter level. U.S. high-grade fee capture continues to benefit from the low yield rate environment and the longer average years to maturity of bonds traded.
 The other product category fees per million were $216 in the third quarter of 2012, up from $175 a year ago and from $205 in the second quarter of 2012. Higher fee capture emerging market and high yield volume accounted for the increase and represented 60% of the other product category volume in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 48% one year ago.
 Slide 12, provides you with the expense detail. The 11% year-over-year increase in total expenses was driven by a higher incentive bonus provision of $1 million, and $500,000 of Xtrakter deal costs. By way of reminder during the third quarter of last year, we’ve reduced the year-to-date bonus provision. Excluding these items, third quarter expenses were up approximately 5% year-over-year.
 Expenses for the first 9 months of 2012 were $83 million. Assuming a first quarter 2012, 2013 close date, we would expect half of the Xtrakter transaction cost to be recognized in the third and fourth quarter of 2012, and the remainder in the first quarter of 2013. Under this scenario, we believe that our full year 2012 expenses will be towards the upper end of our original guidance range of $107 million to $112 million.
 Excluding the Xtrakter cost, full year 2012 expenses would be near the middle of that original guidance range.
 On slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale as of September 30, were $204 million compared to $248 million at year end 2011 and $238 million one year ago.
 Cash return to shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly dividend over the past 12 months amounted to $96 million. We spent $1.5 million in the third quarter to repurchase 49,000 shares under the share repurchase plan. Capital expenditures totaled $9 million for the first 9 months of 2012.
 We recently had a successful deployment of our replacement disaster recovery data center and continue to expect that full year capital expenditures will be near the high end of the original guidance range of $8 million to $11 million. There was no change in our capital structure during the third quarter and we continue to have no bank debt.
 Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. 
Richard McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are seeing broad-based trading momentum across many product areas including U.S. high-grade, emerging markets, high-yield and CDS. We believe that we are on the right target with our open trading initiatives to develop alternative sources of liquidity for dealers and investors. We are enthusiastic about the pending acquisition of Xtrakter and the additional product capabilities it will bring to our European dealer and investor clients. We see growing momentum in our business and a larger opportunity set ahead.
 Now I will be happy to open the line for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy from Raymond James. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: First question on the deal that you guys did, can you elaborate maybe a little bit more on some of the - the revenue synergies, so many some of the cross-selling opportunities that you have with that deal and then maybe some of the cost synergies down the road, I think you kind of implied maybe 2014 for that? 
Richard McVey: Sure, Patrick. We are happy to obviously, we value the deal based on the Xtrakter core business as it exists today. So when you look the details around the MiFID II regulatory changes, and the industry move toward T+2 settlement, we do believe that there are 2 potential areas of synergies in bringing our capabilities and clients together with Xtrakter. The first is with their market leading position and regulatory transaction reporting today. They do have a broad base of transaction data that we believe will become an important part of the infrastructure as the European markets move to approve publication arrangements and eventually a consolidated trade tape. So we do think that this is an important part of the business expansion for Xtrakter, and obviously with all the work we’ve done in the MarketAxess bond ticker and the TRACE reporting in the U.S., we think it did perfectly with our value proposition for the overall electronic trading business. The second part of it is really around the trade matching services, and as dealers and investors are forced to comply with shorter settlement periods, real-time trade matching will become more important to make sure they can meet those obligations to settle trades on a shorter time cycle. So we do think in that area too given the position that Xtrakter now has with regulatory transaction reporting, there is an opportunity for us to expand those trade matching services and in some scenarios include more investor clients in the trade matching business. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay, that’s helpful. I guess a follow-up question, so this is probably the first deal that I think I remember you guys doing in quite some time. Do you think there could be more deals following this? So I guess you guys may be more inclined to use some of your extra cash to do deals at this point in your growth cycle or do think that this might be it for a while? 
Richard McVey: Yes, I think as we’ve said many times Patrick, if we can find businesses that fit as well as Xtrakter does with our strategic vision and our service to our clients, we will continue to be very interested. As you know, we have been disciplined, we haven’t seen that many deals that can compete with our organic growth opportunities over the last 4 or 5 years. And right now this was a transaction that fit us perfectly and if we see more of these along the way, we would be happy to take a very close look. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay, great. And then one last one if I could, your U.S. distribution fees, I believe went up a little bit $300,000 quarter-over-quarter, did you send up another dealer, or that’s just kind of an accounting thing? 
Antonio DeLise: Patrick, on that one, towards the end of the third quarter, we did have one of the dealers on the all variable plan, move up or convert to the fixed plan. So, that accounted for most of that distribution fee difference in the U.S. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Then can we expect to see a little bit more sequential increase than in the fourth quarter? 
Antonio DeLise: I said that will be largely consistent distribution fees that'd be consistent with the third quarter. There could be a slight uptick for this one dealer, yes. 
Operator: The next question is from the line of Niamh Alexander of KBW. 
Niamh Alexander: Hi, just on the cash again, I guess this is a time, ahead of all the tax changes to our - folks are trying to figure out, who is going to pay a special dividend ahead of taxes and what all that means. Can you help me understand, you’ve done this deal, I still think you have excess cash outside of this deal, but am I thinking right that you probably want to keep some powder dry here because they could be some opportunities with all this regulatory changes and some fall outs. And as well as, maybe Tony, you would update us, I know certain levels it’s a may be a return of capital if you did do a certain place dividend, so therefore impending tax changes might not make a difference? 
Richard McVey: Sure, sure. Niamh, you’re right. We still have even after the Xtrakter acquisition, we’ll still have a lot of cash and even looking at it right now, if we payout $44 million or so for Xtrakter and even after paying out the year-end bonuses, it’s pretty reasonable to expect that we have something north of $150 million in cash. And even at that time, still a strong balance sheet, unlevered, lots of debt capacity, still generating lots of free cash flow. We still think that we can maintain the capital management policy and still act accordingly along with dividends and share repurchases. We still have that flexibility. When it comes to things like special dividends, I will tell you right now it’s probably a little less likely having done the Xtrakter acquisition, but we will continue to access whether we want to do something around a special dividend or expand the stock repurchase plan. And there is still a lot of uncertainly around what’s happening with the expiring tax rules, so we’ll continue to take a look at it with the board in the fourth quarter. But we do still have the capacity, I think you’re right, so your observation on and the question before from Patrick also around acquisitions and are there others out there. I think we do want to maintain a strong balance sheet, strong cash position for those opportunities that could come along. 
Niamh Alexander: And then, if I could, what you’re beating it’s at the rate card because of this continued strength in high yield and the emerging markets. Great to see. Can you give us some more color. You think you’ve gained some share because the overall industry volume is down. Have you gathered new customers, is it the same customers, the European customers trading, what is that do you think that’s driving overall market growth? And then can you give us an update on kind of the go local in the emerging market. How is that going? 
Richard McVey: Yes, happy to do so. I think we are seeing a broader base of clients active in the EM products and high yield products. It tends to be the people that have been active with us in the high grade product that are increasing utilizing the trading capabilities and the transaction services for EM and high-yield. And the industry volumes have been kind of flat. Clearly the EM and high yield traffic is partly driven by the search for yield, but we are very pleased that we are starting to see a significant pickup in market share that’s traded electronically and more comfort from investors and dealers in doing so across the MarketAxess platform. With respect to local markets, we are on track with our plans for the year, we are signing up more Latin American clients that can be active not only in the Latin American local markets, but also on our U.S. and European platforms. We are increasing the number of dealers that are available for market making in the local markets. Not a huge part of what we’re doing in the EM business overall today, but we’re happy with the progress and we think it will have an impact down the road. 
Niamh Alexander: Okay, fair enough, thanks. And then if I could move back to your high-grade market and you’ve rolled out the list functionality. Thank you for the data points you’ve given us in the presentation on the increasing trade count. Can you just maybe give us an update or some more color about how that’s going? And then secondly in the high-grade, just to go back to all the things that we felt moved your stock earlier in the year, but headlines about a new potential competitive venues, have you had any clients - have you been reaching out, have you had any clients kind of data switching or finding more matches on these venues or by the way we want you to cut your fees in MarketAxess, because we have an alternative? 
Richard McVey: Yes, I’m happy to address that, I think this path involves a significant shift in behavior for investor clients. In my own views it will take time to develop. And we’re very pleased with the foundation that’s being built on the MarketAxess system. We obviously have the largest base of investor electronic order flow in credit in the U.S. markets currently. And virtually every week, we’re seeing an increase in the number of orders that are going into market lists. There was a significant step up as I mentioned in the third quarter. There has been another big step up in October. So I think investor willingness to expose orders more broadly and get orders into market list is a very encouraging sign. On the other side, every week we are seeing more investor set up watch lists, so they can be alerted when orders come into the system that may fit with their portfolio needs. And that is starting to trigger more investor-to-investor trade matches. As I cautioned earlier that too is in early stages and it’s a tiny part of what we are doing, but I think if you look at the number of clients that are involved, the number of orders that we are seeing, the trade matches, all of these are encouraging signs and we think are complementing the service that we provide to expand beyond just purely the dealer liquidity pool. With respect to the competition, we don’t really have anything new there, obviously, there are a number of initiatives out in the marketplace. It’s our understanding that none of them are seeing instant gratification. In many cases, we continue to believe that they do not compete directly with what we do. And I think our independence and the size of our dealer and investor installed network give us a very large advantage, as long as we continue to innovate and add new technology matching solutions to the existing platform on MarketAxess. 
Niamh Alexander: Okay. So there are no inclination or push back on the fees, other than the unusual? 
Richard McVey: Obviously, we have not made any fee changes. As Tony reported earlier, the fees remain constant on the system and it’s really product and maturity mix that is moving the fee capture around. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller, Sidoti & Company. 
Hugh Miller: Just I guess as a follow-up on kind of the improvement in the use of order lists that you guys have talked about. Obviously you guys have tried to add some functionality there. But is there any particular reason you are hearing from clients as to that the change in sentiment there and why they are more willing to kind of use that and kind of focus on the client-to-client cost matching now relatively to times past? 
Richard McVey: Yes, I think that our constraint on market liquidity is causing investors to be much more proactive about developing alternative sources of liquidity. And even though as you know, TRACE volumes are likely to be flat again this year overall. If you look at the turnover of outstanding corporate debt, turnover is declining, because the base of outstanding debt is up about 28% or so over the last 4 or5 years, so flat TRACE volumes reflect a decline in overall market turnover. And if that continues, it becomes more and more difficult to create alpha in active portfolio management strategies. And investors I think are moving with their fee to develop new solutions to address that problem, created primarily by the regulatory changes that are taking place in the industry. So we see tremendous support, not just in what they are doing with market list, but also in the input that they are providing to us, and various ways that we can help to address the problem. Obviously as I mentioned earlier, the declined in block trading, may be positive for electronic market share in credit markets. It’s a very difficult challenge for large money managers that are trying to move larger positions through the market. So I think you do see that there is a broad recognition among institutional investors and dealers that they need to act differently to develop new solutions. And we’re very pleased to see the breadth of support that we have around the new functionality that we have been developing. 
Hugh Miller: Okay, great color there. And I guess, in talking about some of the comments you made about market share and obviously with some of the challenges to the hit rate during the third quarter, anything touch of an headwind. I was wondering if you could just make any commentary about the hit rate you’re kind of seeing in October. And I know you typically tend to have a seasonal benefit on the market share towards the latter part of the year as we see even more trading of the non-block size trade. So, I mean is that something you are still confident in as we think about the fourth quarter on your share? 
Richard McVey: Yes, let me address the hit rate question and then Tony can talk a little bit about the seasonal impacts on share typically for the fourth quarter. But oddly enough we have a shortage of credit bonds in the market currently and you can see that with the demand that exists for new issues as they come to market and also the demand for secondary paper. And dealer inventories as you are at 10-year lows. So we are seeing the biggest gap currently in our hit rates for bids wanted versus offers wanted that we have ever seen. And as a result offers wanted are having a very difficult time getting filled and that is where the overall hit rate on the MarketAxess system has declined somewhat. And as I mentioned earlier, we think that that has held back our market share gains, because the investor order flow growth continues to be very strong. Typically, these imbalances do get corrected over time, but that’s the short-term situation that we are in. And in a healthier environment, we would expect not only the growth in investor order flow. We would also expect to see the hit rates back above 70%. And I think in a more balanced market, that’s what we continue to expect. 
Antonio DeLise: And then just a follow-up just on October share and how that relates to the full fourth quarter, just looking back over the last several years, and if history does tell us anything, the fourth quarter is typically our strongest market share quarter, and just looking back over the last several years, it’s anywhere from 60 basis points to 130 basis points higher than the third quarter. Now it will be a typical pattern for us, but even within the quarter, we can look at market share by month. October is always the lowest market share. As everybody knows, December is always the highest market share month during the quarter. So, if history proves out here, we are confident we can get this market share number back above Q3 levels and back in line with the historical growth you’ve seen from Q3 to Q4. 
Hugh Miller: Okay, great color there. And one house-keeping question, I do appreciate the additional detail for the Xtrakter deal. As we think about the revenue that you guys have mentioned there, roughly about $24 million, is that all in kind of the revenue areas with the technology fees or will some of that actually flow through on the European high grade based on some of the trading solutions or how should we think about that? 
Richard McVey: We haven’t settled on exactly where we are going to report the Xtrakter revenues. I think if we keep with the current view, it would end up following down in the data area and any exhaust that we get from the trading on the Eurobond onside, would flow up into the product category. We haven’t quite settled on how we’re going to show that right now. 
Hugh Miller: Okay. And last question I had was just, obviously, I think, the noise around the elections has kind of pushed off progress made on any type of CDS regulation, but can you just give us an update on where things stand now and what you’re hearing in your expectations for timetables? 
Richard McVey: Sure. I’d be happy to and I think you’re right. The elections have sidetracked things temporarily. I was invited to a small gathering with Chairman Gensler for about a week ago with the group of likely SEFs. And in that meeting he said that the CFTC still hopes to finalize the SEF rules by the end of this year. He acknowledged that they do have a busy calendar over the next few months. But he said that the final rule set was now on the hands of the commissioners and that they would be studying that carefully. And that was his hope that they could come to consensus and finalize those rules by the end of this year. We’ve heard less from the SEC with respect to their timetable for the securities-based SEF rules. I think we would all be guessing, but most people think at this point, it’s likely to be later in 2013 when we see the SEC securities-based SEF rules. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz from Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Matthew Heinz: Just have a question on the hit rates in the market share trends in 3Q. I guess I’m just wondering if you’re seeing some of that new issue backlog. I think we saw some record issuance for this time a year in 3Q. Just wondering if you’re seeing some of that backlog clear out, this may have weighed on hit rate share a little bit in 3Q and whether you expect that new issuance to begin and turning over in the secondary market in 4Q, the lack of liquidity is out there? 
Richard McVey: Yes, October was obviously another pretty good month for new issues. The activity is higher than it was in the second quarter and you’re absolutely right to point out that when the new issue calendar is active, typically our share falls a bit as the focus goes to the new issue allocations and trading that’s being conducted on swap with the underwriters. We would typically expect as we move later into the fourth quarter that the new issue calendar does slowdown. And that’s one of the factors that I think causes our share through the fourth quarter to typically improve. And then when you flip into the New Year, the first quarter is normally very active quarter for new issues. I think part of the question is on the timing. We are seeing pre-refunding and early rollovers and issuance from various corporations because the yield rate environment is so attractive. So there may be some front loading of new issue supply coming to the market now, that all else equal would cause supply to be a little bit less in the future periods. 
Matthew Heinz: Okay. And do you think there’s been any kind of pull forward of new issuance that typically takes place in the first quarter and generally weighs on your share in that period? 
Richard McVey: It’s hard to know. The new issue numbers are strong, but they are not off the chart, so I would be hesitant to say that we think that the activity in the last few months has pulled anything meaningful out of the first quarter calendar. 
Matthew Heinz: Okay. And then if I could just a follow up on Xtrakter, you said it would be EPS neutral in 2013, including amortization, but I’m just wondering how much accretion you might expect on a cash basis? And then also how much did you bake into your valuation in terms of maybe the regulatory catalysts with MiFID II and the consolidated trade tape in Europe? 
Antonio DeLise: Sure, so Matt's just taking the first part of the question on the cash flow piece of it. In the prepared remarks, I mentioned that it would be neutral to earnings in 2013. And that’s after the amortization of intangibles. And we haven’t finished the appraisal work there, yet, but you just sort of rule of thumb for acquisitions like this it’s something like 25% of the purchase price over the tangible assets. It could fall into amortizable intangibles. And again, we haven’t finished the work but that number could be something like $1 million U.S. in terms of amortization of intangibles each year. But I do caution, what we’re doing here, we will be investing in people, and systems, and infrastructure mainly on the technology side. So when we look at over the next 4 years for Xtrakter, it’s based on our current view. It could be something like $8 million sterling or $9 million sterling that will be investing, and again technology investments around people, systems and infrastructure over the next 4 years or so. And some of that is capital spending, for example we will be building out some new data centers and investing in technology system. So some of that is capital spending, a lot of that is front-end loaded, so purely looking at it from a cash flow standing point. We do not expect it to be a significant contributor to free cash flow. 
Richard McVey: On the second part of the question, Hugh, as we mentioned earlier, we valued the Xtrakter business based on its core business today. As you would expect, we looked at a number of different ways with respect to multiples, comparable transactions, DCF model. But we are attracted to the potential synergies that may come from this deal down the road, which you alluded to as the MiFID II regulations take hold probably later in 2014. And with over a 4 million transaction regulatory reports per day going through Xtrakter and the leading position in fixed income trade reporting specifically, we really like being in the center of that. And we think we can expand our services to our European clients, and certainly operating in a real time environment for trade reporting and transactions is what we do today. So that’s clearly part of the appeal to the transaction, but our valuation was based on their core business as it exists today. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead, sir. 
Jillian Miller: So I just wanted to ask one more question on Xtrakter, I’m sure you guys are getting sick of hearing it. But when I hear consolidated tape that makes me think of kind of like a utility business and something that wouldn’t necessarily be generating the type of margins that you guys are used to in your other businesses. So I just - I’m just sure I’m just missing something some nuance of the business model, but maybe you could just give us a little bit more detail about that? 
Richard McVey: Ron, talk about the margins and I will talk about the… 
Ronald Hersch: Sure, sure. Jillian, just looking historically at this business standalone, the operating margins have bounced around a little bit. But in recent years, they’ve been in that 15% to 20% range. And we will be making as I mentioned, making some investments here in the near-term, so that will cause some depression in operating margins, but we certainly think, once the revenue synergies kick in, and once we come from these new technology investments drive some efficiencies into the business. We do think longer-term that we can get those growth rates and margins. If could be consistent with what you are seeing out from us, out of the Xtrakter standalone business. And that would be excluding the potential synergies and impact on trading on our European platform. So, Rick mentioned one of the important elements is integrating what Xtrakter does and can do into our trading platform in Europe. And there, we do think that there is a significant benefit there if we have strong form of price discovery built into the trading platform would give us an advantage. 
Richard McVey: And, Jillian, just looking back at the experience in the U.S. there was a significant uptick in the electronic trading market share of following the implementation of the TRACE tape in 2002. And I do think all the quality real-time price data is critical to getting investors and dealers more comfortable with increasing electronic trading share. So, we do believe that this is a core part of our future European product offering, again in line with the regulatory changes. That really getting our quality real-time product fully integrated in what we do in electronic trading is likely to be positive for the electronic trading share in Europe. 
Jillian Miller: Okay, that makes sense. Then one other thing I want to ask you guys about, TradeWeb last month added, I guess a dealer-to-dealer portion to its electronic trading platform for CDS seems to be getting some initial traction and there is a lot of buzz about it. I just want to get your thoughts on whether, opening up your dealer-to-client model to dealer-to-dealer as well might be something you’re looking at and I guess just more broadly in how you're looking to position yourselves competitively in the evolving CDS electronic trading market? 
Richard McVey: Yes, we’re not exactly sure exactly what’s the buzz of activity is on other competitor platforms for CDS. We saw some of the press reports on D2D that you alluded to. Certainly we’re wide open to that. We have obviously expanded our bond offering to dealer-to-dealer business because of the demand that we have from existing bond clients. And we would certainly be open to doing that with respect to the CDS platform as well. And it is early days. We’re going to have some fairly significant regulatory changes for the CDS market in the upcoming year or 2. And I think a lot has to be determined in terms of the competitive landscape around SEF’s for both indices and single names and in the D2D and the client-to-dealer market. We do feel very good about the functionality that we’ve been adding to our CDS system. The breath of participation that we now have and the independence that we enjoy as a public company, which is also one of the key criteria outlined in the SEF proposed rules. 
Jillian Miller: Okay, thanks. I mean, with respect to the SEF proposed rules, it looks like there is some delays coming and - but potentially if Romney is elected, we could see more than delays that could be - that the SEF rules are fundamentally changed watered you’re down or even eliminated. So I just would like to get your thoughts on what that means for the CDS initiative? I mean is this a viable business that it still have the same type of growth potential absence SEF rules or in a scenario where the SEF rules are materially different? 
Richard McVey: I think that’s a good question. I agree that there is a bit more uncertainty about the timing now then what we would have expected 6 months ago. And our view is that the benefits of electronic trading within fixed income securities and derivatives are coming through in the market share gains and the investor behavior changes that we see across multiple products. And eventually CDS will follow suit and move in that direction as well. The pace of that adoption clearly will depend on the regulatory changes. And I continue to believe that when it comes to the swap rules that there seems to be bipartisan support. There might be some differences in the rule side and the timing of implementation. But it’s our view that in most scenarios you’re going to see them continue to move forward with finalizing and implementing the rules for SEFs and security-based SEFs. 
Jillian Miller: Okay, thanks. And just one final one from me on the incremental margins, I mean they are going to be lower this year and I know you are investing a lot in CDS and some other new initiatives, but just wondering as we look to 2013 especially given some of the investments you mentioned related to Xtrakter, Should we be back at that 60% to 70% type of incremental margin level that we are at kind of before this year or going forward should we be more around kind of the 2012 level? 
Richard McVey: Yes, Jillian, on the incremental margins, our view continues to be and this would be absent the impact of Xtrakter that, we still can generate incremental margins in that 60% to 70% range, albeit we haven’t yet demonstrated those sorts of incremental margins this year, but we still believe that over the longer-term for that core business we can still generate those types of incremental margins. Then obviously it’s going to be an impact once we roll in Xtrakter here. We’ll try and give you more visibility on that as the months go on. The deal-- hopefully we’ll closing the first quarter, we’ll have more to say about it and more to say about the financial impact and outlook for 2013 at that point in time. But again, just thinking about the core business, even with the investments we’re making, if we can continue to drive that top line revenue growth, we still feel good about those longer-term incremental margins in that 60% to 70% range. 
Operator: The next question is from the line of Howard Chen of Credit Suisse. 
Howard Chen: I think the financials you present that are helpful and there has been a lot of questions. But could you just give us a sense of what’s growth has been like over the past few years under the Euroclear ownership before accounting for integration cost, amortization and your synergy expectations? 
Antonio DeLise: On the - Howard, on the top line revenue numbers, you look back over the last or 2 or 3 or 4 years under the Euroclear umbrella. Xtrakter’s revenues have been around US$24 million, US$25 million, something between GBP15 million to GBP16 million. That’s been a pretty consistent revenue number there. And again, I mentioned before, on the margin side, they’ve bumped around a little bit, but thinking about sort of a normalized margin, it’s been in that 15% to 20% range. 
Howard Chen: Great, that’s really helpful. Thanks Tony. And then, one of the last meaningful transactions I recall you doing was Greenline that helped you bolster your technology business and fixed connectivity. Rick, maybe just as it appears down the road. Can you just update us on how growth within that portion of the business has been and how returns have been versus your initial expectations upon deal announcement back in 2008? 
Richard McVey: Greenline, obliviously, we are reporting within our technology business, so it’s been quite visible. The transaction, much like Xtrakter, was a bolt-on to our existing business. We feel good about promoting fixed standards throughout the fixed income industry and the work that we are doing with clients there. It’s obvious to see that the growth rates from Greenline have not matched the core business, but perhaps that’s because the core business growth rates exceeded most expectation over the last 4 years. So we still think that fixed certification software solutions are valuable piece of the overall offering and fit with our business objectives, but the growth rate there has not been as strong as what we’ve seen in the core. 
Howard Chen: Okay, great. And then just final one, just a follow-up on what you briefly touched on before regarding issuance levels and your market share. You spoke in the past - right post of new issue good to that business might still be done over the phone. Has that evolved or changed at all with all the structural and cyclical issues going on in the credit markets and is that any different in your experience in the high yield market versus the U.S. high-grade market? 
Richard McVey: I think the impact is similar and certainly, Howard, you are familiar with that dynamic. When a new issue calendar is active all of the focus in the credit markets is on that calendar. And often times, investors have large block swap trades to do to clear room to purchase new issues and it’s highly likely that those transactions are going to be conducted with the underwriters that control the allocations on the new issue. So there is a slice of that secondary market in a TRACE volume that is directly attached to the new issue supply. And when the new issues are more active than not, that will else equal will have a dilutive effect on our overall share. And I think the key thing is if you look over time and this is why we think quarterly measures of market share are probably a better guide than looking at monthly stats, but if you look over time the share gains continue to be very visible in our business. And then based on everything we see going on with investor orders across products, we think that trend is still very much intact. 
Operator: And the next question is from the line of Niamh Alexander from KBW. 
Niamh Alexander: Hi, sorry. Just one follow-up on Xtrakter and I know you said it’s going to be earnings neutral next year anyway and you’re hoping for some accretion in 2014. But for me it’s like the leading with the trade analytics has been so important for you to kind of build the business especially with liquidity so fragmented. So I don’t consider it to be utility, but to understand better in the European context, does TradeWeb competitor over there, do Bloomberg, do they have to use that data, does everybody have to kind of report their trades there yet? Or is it something kind of hoping for as a rule kind of get more clear? 
Richard McVey: The primary clients of the regulatory transaction reporting services of Xtrakter are the dealers need. 
Niamh Alexander: Okay. 
Richard McVey: So irrespective of where they transact their bond trades in Europe, they would be reporting them in many cases through Xtrakter. There are other approved regulatory mechanisms in Europe today, but the leading provider of those services for the fixed income markets in Europe is Xtrakter. 
Niamh Alexander: So your competitors would likely have to have access to that information as well? 
Richard McVey: I suspect that in terms of some of the data contracts that exist within Xtrakter, some of the competitors that you mentioned are currently utilizing that data, yes. 
Operator: Thank you. We have no further question in queue. [Operator Instructions] 
Richard McVey: Well, thank you very much for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Thank you.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-07-25 00:00:00) =====
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. 
David Cresci: Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess second quarter 2012 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results.
 Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website.
 Now, let me turn the call over to Rick. 
Richard McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2012 results. This morning we released solid second quarter financial results, in spite of industry-wide headwinds during the quarter.
 Revenues of $48.8 million and pre-tax income of $21.2 million were both 7% above the second quarter of 2011. Diluted EPS improved $0.34 compared to $0.30 one year ago.
 Despite the softer overall market volumes, we feel very good about the progress made during the quarter. Our estimated U.S. high grade market share accelerated to a record level of 12.4% compared to 11.1% in the second quarter of 2011.
 Emerging markets and high-yield volumes were both up over 25%, and reached record levels during the quarter. Importantly, we continue to deliver new electronic trading solutions to help our dealer and investor clients interact with new counter-parties and develop new sources of liquidity.
 Slide 4 displays some details on our quarterly results and financial strength. Solid revenue growth in the quarter was the principal driver of the growth in pre-tax income to $21.2 million.
 EBITDA was up 8% to $23.2 million versus the second quarter of 2011. Operating and EBITDA margins were 43% and 48%, respectively.
 Free cash flow and strong balance sheet have allowed us to return cash to investors through share repurchases and growing dividends. Our cash and securities balance at June month end was $188 million or $5.03 per diluted share. The Board has approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share.
 Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. Credit concerns reemerged in Europe during the quarter and market volumes of cross products were softer than the first quarter averages. For the first half of 2012, high-grade TRACE is on pace for $3 trillion in annual volume, flat to 2011.
 Inflows into bond funds remain strong in spite of the decline in new issuance and flattening of the yield curve. Block trading, or trades of $5 million or more, continues to trend lower as a percentage of overall high-grade TRACE volume, as primary dealers operate with much smaller market-making balance sheets.
 Block trades represented 38% of total TRACE volume in the second quarter, down from 45% in the second quarter of 2011. Smaller trade sizes, where we typically have a higher market share, continue to make up a larger percentage of TRACE.
 Slide 6 summarizes the trading volume across our product categories. Overall global volume in the second quarter was up 9% year-over-year to $145 billion. Q2 high-grade TRACE volumes were flat compared to a year ago, and the 12% increase in our U.S. high-grade volume to $91 billion was due solely to market share gains. A 24% increase in investor orders versus the second quarter of 2011 drove the market share gain.
 Eurobond volumes were down 22% from the second quarter of 2011 to $7.8 billion. Volatile credit spreads and investor risk reduction in Europe had caused market volumes to decline. Our cross-regional business from European investor clients into emerging markets and U.S. high-grade bonds grew 46% from the prior-year period, offsetting the volume decline in Eurobonds.
 Other product category volumes were up 10% from the second quarter of 2011 to $46 billion in the second quarter of 2012. As mentioned earlier, growth in high yield and emerging markets drove the increase in the other product category.
 Slide 7 provides an update on regulatory activity. New regulations are having a far-reaching impact on the way bonds and swaps trade. Basel III capital requirements, the proposed Volcker Rules and Dodd-Frank are driving a number of important market changes. Primary dealer market-making balance sheets are declining due to an increase in capital requirements leading to a reduction in block trading.
 New non-bank affiliated dealers are increasing their capital commitment to market making and increasing their market share. Electronic trading is growing in credit bonds and CDS. Dealers and investors are seeking increased electronic connectivity to develop new sources of liquidity.
 In CDS, we currently expect the CFTC to finalize SEF rules and implementation schedules in the third quarter. The SEC has not yet published a time table for securities-based SEF rules, but we would expect the SEC rules for single name CDS to slip into 2013. We are investing heavily in CDS trading functionality and clearing connectivity to prepare to register as a SEF.
 While still in early days of adoption, our efforts paid off during the second quarter with CDS trading volume on the system up more than 150% versus the first quarter. We are seeing growing participation from dealers and investors.
 Slide 8 gives an update on our new initiatives. We have expanded our suite of electronic trading protocols to help investors and dealers more effectively source liquidity in the credit markets. With our enhanced market list functionality investors can now display any live order anonymously to the entire MarketAxess institutional community consisting of over 1,000 investor and broker-dealer firms.
 Over 32,000 orders were submitted to market list during the second quarter. We have a defined roadmap to rollout additional trading protocols and functionality to increase order matching opportunities for investors and dealers. Demand for these new solutions is running very high.
 As announced yesterday, we have developed the industry's first anonymous request-for-a-quote trading protocol for credit markets on DealerAxess, our dealer-to-dealer electronic trading platform. Over 100 dealers are participating and more than 5,000 trades have been executed since the anonymous functionality was introduced 2 months ago.
 These new products, client segments and trading protocols combined with the strong results in our core products demonstrate the growing opportunities that we see for MarketAxess in global electronic credit markets.
 Now, let me turn the call over to Tony, for more detail regarding our financial results. 
Antonio DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Slide 9 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $48.8 million were up 7% from a year ago, driven principally by growth in variable transaction fee commissions.
 The year-over-year decline in technology products and services revenues was due to lower professional services fees. Total expenses were $27.6 million, up 7% from the second quarter of 2011, and pre-tax income was $21.2 million, also 7% above last year.
 Our year-to-date incremental margins were 63%. This means for each additional revenue dollar generated, approximately $0.63 fell to the operating income line. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 40.6%. We are trending towards a higher-end of our 2012 tax guidance range due to a decline in foreign-sourced income.
 Our diluted EPS was $0.34 on 37.4 million diluted shares. The second quarter diluted share count reflects the full impact of the share repurchases completed in the first quarter of 2012.
 On slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees-per-million. Distribution fees were $14.3 million during the second quarter of 2012, down 8.5% from the second quarter of 2011 and 11% from the first quarter. The $1.8 million sequential decline is consistent with the guidance provided on our first quarter earnings call. We currently expect that third quarter distribution fees will be consistent with the second quarter level.
 U.S. high-grade fees-per-million were $202 in the second quarter, up from $184 in the second quarter of 2011, and $188 in the first quarter of 2012. The sequential change was primarily due to a combination of an increase in the duration of high-grade bonds traded and greater impact of the execution fee from the all-variable dealer plan.
 The other product category fees-per-million were $205 in the second quarter of 2012, up from $182 a year ago and consistent with the first quarter of 2012. The second quarter volume mix in the Other product category, which consists of emerging market, high yield and agency bonds, was largely consistent with the first quarter.
 Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. The 7% year-over-year increase in total expenses is in line with our 5-year compounded annual growth rate and driven by a combination of expense growth in core products and investment in new initiatives.
 The sequential quarterly decline in employee compensation and benefits is mainly due to seasonally higher payroll tax in the first quarter and a lower incentive bonus accrual, which is tied directly to operating performance.
 The expenses for the first half of 2012 were $55.6 million. Our full year 2012 expenses are trending toward the higher-end of our original guidance range of $107 million to $112 million.
 On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale as of June 30, were $188 million compared to $248 million at year-end 2011 and $211 million 1 year ago.
 Cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly dividend over the past 12 months amounted to $94 million, and was mostly funded by pre-tax flow generated over that period of $64 million.
 Capital expenditures, which include computer software and equipment together with capitalized software development costs associated with trading platform enhancements and new products, totaled $3.6 million for the first half of 2012.
 As mentioned on our year-end earnings call, we're in the process of building out a replacement disaster recovery data center. We expect that capital expenditures will increase in the second half of the year, and believe that our full year capital expenditures are trending towards the high-end of our original guidance range of $8 million to $11 million. There was no change in our capital structure during the second quarter and we continue to have no bank debt.
 Now, let me turn the call back to Rick, for some closing comments. 
Richard McVey: Thank you, Tony. Our second quarter results show solid growth in core products and positive progress in developing new electronic marketplaces. We believe that we have the right trading network and technology capabilities to provide a full menu of liquidity solutions to address today's changing credit market structure. We are excited about the opportunities ahead.
 Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Howard Chen from Credit Suisse. 
Howard Chen: Rick, just wanted your latest thoughts on competitive landscape. Over the years, you've been really consistent and saying that any electronic offering that come to this market is ultimately good and validation of the MarketAxess business model. But it does look like maybe you're becoming like more in direct competition with some of these new offerings that we read about. I mean, would you agree with that statement? And is there any different sense or evolution of the thinking on competitive landscape from your perspective? 
Richard McVey: Not really. No. I think what you see from some of the new initiatives is a desire to promote investor-to-investor order matching, especially in larger trade sizes. And that is where there is strain in the secondary markets today and you can see that through the decline in block trading that is coming through on a quarterly basis in the high grade. And I think when we look at these initiatives it does validate that there is a desire for more electronic connectivity in the market. We need to keep building new solutions, which we are confident that we are doing. And I think you'll see a core belief here that while investor-to-investor order matching can compliment dealer liquidity, it will never replace it. And where we are going, Howard, it is to really make sure that we have a full suite of electronic trading solutions that promote not only investor-to-investor order matching, but investor-to-multi-dealer and now increasingly dealer-to-dealer, so that we can help all clients move bonds through the market more quickly and efficiently. And as you're well aware, during the quarter, investor-to-investor matching has certainly made for some interesting headlines. But when you really get into the facts in the secondary market for credit, there is a limit to the amount of investor matching that could conceivably take place. And specifically, when we look through our TRACE and the customer buys and sells on a daily basis, we estimate that if you had access to 100% of the investor orders during the day, you could match approximately 12% to 16% of high-grade TRACE volume. And I think this reflects the challenge in the market, which we also think supports our strategy, that we need solutions across every possible client segment to promote more liquidity in the markets. So I do you think that the world is changing and people are going to try different things. What we're seeing from our investor and dealer clients, broadly based, is full support for the direction that we are taking, the independence of the company and the size of our network. And we think we're on the right track. 
Howard Chen: And then second one for you, Rick. Nice expansion within the U.S. market share. I'm curious, if you have any thoughts about how much of the share gaining is secular trends, as in more electronification, increasingly constrained dealer balance sheet? And how much of this is maybe cyclical, that the company gets a bit of a rebound when issuance levels are low and overall liquidity is low within the broad U.S. high-grade industry? 
Richard McVey: There is definitely a cyclical nature to the quarterly share, Howard, as you know, where typically the fourth quarter is very favorable for electronic share and the first quarter, where you have very heavy new issuance, tends to be slightly softer. But I think anyone looking at the last 3 years of share gains would say that there is a meaningful and sustainable increase in electronic market share taking place in credit. And I think the second quarter was another great data point. And as we pointed out earlier this morning, the 12.4% share during the second quarter compares quite favorably to the second quarter of last year. And that trend has been with us now really for 3 straight years coming out of the credit crisis. 
Howard Chen: And then final thing for me, Rick. The 150% growth in CDS volumes, I realize we're probably talking about growth of a very modest base. But could you just provide a little bit more detail about where that growth is coming from? How the flow is maybe changed since you've launched the offering? And what if 150% growth and volume translated into revenues and earnings? 
Richard McVey: Yes, and just to repeat, we are not currently charging transaction fees in the CDS platform. So it has no current impact on revenue or earnings. But we are seeing very good signs of growth in participation in our CDS platform from both dealers and investors. And we're seeing growth and activity, and it's becoming more consistent on daily basis. And what differentiates our offerings, we think, from the others in the marketplace, are the breadth of the solutions that we provide, where each quarter we're adding new functionality. We're now trading not only in the index markets, but we're also trading in the single-name markets. We have completed our connections to both ICE and the CME for central clearing. We've added limit or capabilities to the platform. We have both request-for-quote and multi-dealer streaming protocols. So we feel very good about the developments. And we think it's starting to come true in the increase in trading activity on the platform. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: First question, kind of going back to the competitive landscape question that Howard had. So when we read stories about the buy side getting together with the sell side in Boston and trying to come up on the new system, how much do we read into that, that the buy side is not satisfied with the MarketAxess solution versus some other trends that might be taking place that you think are an opportunity for you guys? 
Richard McVey: I think that the growth in buy side participation and share on MarketAxess reflects their satisfaction with the service that we are providing. Having said that, Patrick, with 12.5% of the market now on MarketAxess, investors are still trading 87% of their volume the old fashion way. And much of the interest in meeting with dealers is to talk about the changes that are taking place in dealer balance sheets and how investors and dealers can work together to develop new solutions. And much of that feedback, whether it's from investors or dealers, is coming directly to us. We've had many, many meetings during the quarter, both individually and with groups of investors, about the new solutions that we are delivering. We've been taking their input on a regular basis. They are defining our roadmap for the next 3 or 4 quarters. And we also work very closely with the dealer community. So I think what it reflects is that there is a shift in market structure taking place and as a result some new enhancements and solutions need to go to work. And we're very pleased with the amount of interest that we're getting directly to MarketAxess in jointly developing those solutions with investors and dealers. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Second question touching on revenue capture. To what extent do you guys think that these trends that you've seen are sustainable? My guess is, the component of the dealers moving from the fixed rate to the variable rate plan, that's probably going to stick, it seems like. But how confident are you that the duration-aided benefit that you guys are experiencing is going to be sustainable? 
Antonio DeLise: Patrick, it's Tony. On the U.S. high-grade fees in particular, there is a lot of different variables in there. It's not only duration dependent, which is influenced by years to maturity and yields. We also have -- within our plan, there is a tiered plan based on volumes, so that the larger the trade size, the smaller the fee. And also that dealer mix does influence it, just between the mix between the all-variable plan and dealers on the major plan. So you've got a bunch of different variables there. And I'll just tell you -- you look sequentially, that we did have a sequential increase in the fee capture and it was almost equally split between duration impact and the execution fees. So they both equally contributed to the increase. But you look out from where we are today and can we maintain that current level? Certainly with what's coming out of the Fed in terms of keeping rates low, we can at least see that in the near-term that will be the case. The yield curve has definitely narrowed over the past 12 months. It's probably come in 150 basis points between the 10 year and the 3 month. So that yield curve's narrowed, it really has not influenced the years to maturity. And as a matter of fact, years to maturity actually extended slightly in the second quarter. And even though those dealers on the all-variable plan, we haven't seen a significant movement in the percentage of their volume. But it's still -- the execution fee is still contributing significantly to that fee capture. So I guess, it's a long-winded way of saying there's lots of variables, it's tough to predict. In the near-term it seems like it's sustainable. You have to have, from here on forward, a marked movement saying years to maturity more than anything else at this point in time to bring down that fee capture. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then if you can remind me, as far as revenue capture specifically on the high yield. Is there an element where you guys get, all else equal, you get paid less for lower rate bonds? 
Richard McVey: This is on high yield, Patrick? 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Sorry, high grade. 
Richard McVey: Can you just repeat the question? 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I think there is a couple of elements to your revenue capture on high-grade. One is the duration of the yield to maturity. The longer duration, you guys get paid more. I think if I recall correctly, there is also a second element, which is kind of a higher rate that is on the bond, the more you guys are going to get paid. Is that correct? 
Richard McVey: It's a tiered plan. I say tiered, so it's tiered based on trade size. So the smaller the trade size, the higher our fee. So our fees are designated on high grade, it's in yield spread over the underlying treasury. And it does range from 0.5 on the high-end with a smaller trade size to 0.1 of the low end, typically averages about 0.2 of 1 basis point. But yes, because we have this tiered-plan based on trade size, the smaller the trade size, the higher the fee capture. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then, lastly, just kind of touching on your expenses. You said that it looks like you are running towards the high-end of your guidance. Are you sticking by your guidance for the full year? 
Richard McVey: We're still sticking by the guidance for the full year. When you look at the first half of the year, we were at $55.6 million. There will be, or at least we're expecting is, just a moderate increase in expenses in the second half of the year. And even if you just took the second quarter as the run rate for the second half, you'd be closer to $110.5 million or $111 million. So right now, sitting here, it does feel like we'll be more towards that higher-end of the range, but still within the $112 million upper-end of the range. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Heinz from Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Matthew Heinz: Given the new kind of new anonymous trading protocols that you're rolling out and introducing, and also the well-known problems that are facing the buy side in block liquidity and cross matching, what issues other than maybe just familiarity do you think would prevent clients from turning to MarketAxess increasingly as a solution to execute more of that 12% to 16% that you cited kind of as the market as cross matching potential? 
Richard McVey: I think it's just continuing to deliver the various matching solutions that buy side thinks could be viable. I do think, Matt, that we have a terrific head start in this. We've been fast at work on bringing new investor clients onto the MarketAxess system for the last 12 years. We have close to 300 of them that are directly integrated into this system with their STP and order management systems. And they are very familiar with the technology and the trading platform. So we think we're in a great place to continue to be the platform of choice as investors look for new matching protocols to complement the existing liquidity that they have in the marketplace. And I don't really see any obstacles. In fact, from what we've seen so far, we do have enthusiastic support in the meetings that we've been holding with a variety of different investors. 
Matthew Heinz: And then just kind of piggy-backing on that question. Have you seen any dealer pushback towards your promotion of market lists and some of the other efforts to encourage more client-to-client matching? 
Richard McVey: The answer to that is really no. I think the dealers are as aware as anyone that market structure is shifting. Dealers need to operate in different ways. We have worked, in all of our solutions, to be inclusive of dealers and investors, because ultimately we think that will create the best liquidity solution. So in no way are we trying to go around the dealers, because we don't think that would be particularly successful overtime. So we're working very closely with them. They're well aware of our strategy and what we're doing. Some of them are offering clients various ways to get orders to them as well. And I think that reflects their recognition that the business model is changing. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Hugh Miller from Sidoti & Company. 
Hugh Miller: I guess one question I had, I didn't catch. Did you guys comment on initial expectations for July market share? 
Richard McVey: No, we didn't. And you and others criticized us for misguiding you because we said something last quarter, when we still had 5 days of trading left and we actually outperformed expectations because of those last 5 days. The first thing we would say is that we do have 5 important trading days still left in July. And probably especially important this month, Hugh, because the July 4 week was a very soft week across markets because of the fact that the holiday fell right in the middle of the week. So our guidance to you right now would be, that based on what we see so far, we would expect July share to be above the second quarter levels. But we do have 5 important days of trading still in front of us in the month. 
Hugh Miller: And would you also anticipate that you'd probably give back a touch of the gains you enjoyed in June? 
Richard McVey: Can't really comment on that just yet, with those 5 important day still remaining. 
Hugh Miller: And I guess another question I had is, if you take a look at kind of the industry-trading volume on an average daily basis, TRACE trading was somewhat sluggish in June compared to the prior June. As you look at the trends, and obviously as you mentioned, we've got some important trading days left, but as we look at July, it is trending down again on an average daily basis. Can you just talk about why you think that, that might be for the last couple of months, just given that we are still seeing solid inflows into taxable funds? 
Antonio DeLise: Hugh, when we look at TRACE volumes and look at the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year, it’s almost identical. Same thing within the quarter. Second quarter was virtually identical to the second quarter of last year. Albeit, off 15% from the first quarter, which was at record levels. And even when we look at July, and Rick mentioned that first week was really a killer. When we look beyond the first 4 trading days, which is in, say the past 4 years, the only time we had a midweek holiday. We look beyond those first 4 trading days and the TRACE volume is spot-on with the prior 3 years. So if you look at say, July, in isolation, the July average daily trading volume in the last 3 years is right around $11 billion. You take out the first 4 trading days, again which were a killer, take out the first 4 trading days in July of this year, and it's a little north of $11 billion. So we're not seeing it fall off, again if we exclude those first 4 days. So Rick made some -- in the prepared remarks, some comments about it trending towards $3 trillion for the full year. Again, without having the ability to forecast trades with any real accuracy, we're still seeing that trend right now. 
Hugh Miller: I understand that over -- you take a look at the half it looks a little bit differently, but when you look at it for June and July, and it's good color that you provided in July, being that the holiday fell midweek, so that may have influenced it more than it normally does. But if you just look at for the last 2 months, it's just been a challenge. And I know that it wasn't the case for your trading activity in June, when you saw tremendous market share growth. But I appreciate the insight there. 
Richard McVey: And just to expand on Tony's comment. The holiday impact this year with the Fourth on a Wednesday, was really a 4-day impact. And when we looked at the prior Julys, it was maybe 1 or 2 days. And I assume, Hugh, that you're seeing that across other asset classes, too, just highly unusual with that holiday sitting right in the middle of the week. 
Hugh Miller: And another question I had was, if you can give us an update on kind of your efforts to leverage your transaction cost analysis with clients. Obviously you saw, and I see, year-over-year improvement in inquiries. But what's the feedback you're getting from clients you are sitting down with? How many, to this point, have you been able work with and how many more are kind of on the plan for the rest of the year and next year? 
Richard McVey: It's now become really part of our quarterly work with investor clients, both those that are using the system actively and those that are using it less than others. And it's been very well received. I think they feel that the analysis is done in a professional and credible way. We do think that is one of the key drivers that is continuing to move our market share up. And it's reflected in the significant increase in investor order flow that we reported this morning with orders up 24% from a year ago. So I think the transaction cost savings are a key part of the value proposition that we are delivering to investors. And all signs are that, that's one of components that's helping us drive the share higher. 
Hugh Miller: So is it safe to say then since you're kind of already incorporating that with your quarterly reviews, that a good portion of that benefit is already now kind of worked in, because you've kind of had a chance to review that analysis with the majority of your clients? 
Richard McVey: I think that the work is more familiar to people. We still see investors at various stages of adoption around electronic trading. And I think what the recent press has done is it's refocused everyone on the benefits of electronic trading and some of that is clearly accruing to us. So the work is out there. Is the full benefit being reflected in the potential yet? We don't think so. But we think we're moving in the right direction. 
Hugh Miller: And another question I had was, as we think about the kind of the focus on growing the dealer-to-dealer trading, how does the pricing in that product compare to client-to-dealer? And how should we be thinking about that? 
Antonio DeLise: Hugh, right now it doesn't vary significantly from what you're seeing on the client-to-dealer side. And it's a little bit of a nuance here, because in that case we're a counter-party to both sides of the trades. So as is the norm, we are reporting both sides of the volume. So I think if you looked at it as a single trade, the pricing would be higher. But when you count both sides of the volume, it looks similar right now to the client-to-dealer pricing, in that $200 per million ranges. 
Hugh Miller: And then the last question I had was just with regard to your share buyback authorization. I know you still have a little bit remaining, given that you haven't been using. But given the pullback we've seen in the stock, is there a kind of a change in sentiment there to revisit share buyback and potentially increase the authorization? 
Antonio DeLise: Hugh, at this time, the Board didn't take any further action to increase that buyback to what's remaining under the buyback. And it's really, when you look at what we did back in the first quarter in terms of big block repurchase with J.P. Morgan., they just didn't feel it was necessary at this point in time. Having said that, we did suspend the repurchase plan in connection with the J.P. Morgan offering. We still have $10 million remaining, authorized under that plan. And while we didn't make any repurchases under the plan in the second quarter, we're still free to utilize that authorized amount. But the Board, again at this point in time, they did look at regulatory and working capital requirements. We're closer to the SEF rules, so we'll have more visibility on the SEF capital requirements, investments we're making obviously in these organic initiatives around CDS and D-to-D, and open trading and international expansion. So I think in light of all of that and in light of what we did in the first quarter, they just didn't take any further action right now. 
Operator: Niamh Alexander from KBW is online. 
Niamh Alexander: The credit derivatives businesses. Should we still think about maybe you targeting more of the single-name credit default products rather than the indices, which kind of it seems like the regulators would very much like to guide the indices more toward exchange-type venues. And in that case, that's the SEC right, who you're signaling is probably going to be 2013 before they approve the SEF stuff. Is that fair? 
Richard McVey: That's our best sense right now. And I think there are two different questions there, Niamh. One is about our focus in CDS, index versus single-name. And then, two, about the regulatory path. We're really -- we're focused on delivering the broadest CDS product offering, which we ultimately think will serve our dealer-investor clients the best. So you do see us out ahead in functionality that addresses both index and single-name trading today. When we get into single-name trading, the liquidity dynamics of single names look more similar to corporate bonds than what you would see in a highly liquid index. And that's why we think some of our technology and network advantages will come through most clearly in single names. Based on what the commissions have been saying, we do expect that the CFTC is very close to finalizing their SEF rules and we would expect those rules to be out this quarter. So we'll get more clarity on the trading protocols, on the implementation dates, et cetera, that are important on index regulation. From what we can tell, and again this is just our best guess and all of you have your own sources as well, but it would appear that the SEC is probably about 6 months behind that time table, which is why we said this morning, if we had to guess we think these security-based SEF rules are more likely to come out in 2013. 
Niamh Alexander: The other thing, I guess we've seen your stock and I thought it was taking a hit as these, kind of, competitive news headlines were coming out. But there is almost like 2 different markets in the corporate bond world, where you have the block trades happening and then you have the non-block, which is your core business. And it seems like the industry is really struggling and looking for solutions for the block trades, on the big size trades, but your stock still gets hit every time there is an announcement of, or a discussion even, of some competitors. Am I understanding it correctly that right now, the struggle is finding liquidity for the bigger size trades and finding a solution for those? And while you absolutely have functionality to participate in that, that's still not the core, the majority of what you do today? 
Richard McVey: I think that's right. What we are excited, when you look at block trading, the nature of block trading is changing, right? More of it is shifting into what people traditionally think of as our sweet spot, in $1 million to $5 million trade sizes and undoubtedly that's another factor that's driving our share higher. But when we think about some of the anonymous order matching capabilities that we have started to deliver and the plans that we have over the next 2 or 3 quarters, we think we've got some really interesting solutions to participate in more block trading business, too. So what this really reflects is, I think, that all 3 major segments of TRACE, whether it's D-to-D, block trading or the $5 million-and-under client-to-dealer business all have greater potential for electronic trading. And we think we are the best position to deliver the solutions across all 3 of those segments of TRACE and I think this quarter is a great sign of support and validation for some of those new initiatives which to us increased the size of our addressable market. 
Niamh Alexander: And then on the dealer-to-dealer, thanks for the new data points there. So you said, like over 32,000 orders submitted. Can you help me understand, is the hit rate improving? Is the match rate improving? Because if the traders don't get the hit and the match, then eventually they give up putting in the orders, too. So are you seeing a notable improvement here? Are you seeing a notable level of hit rate there that you could share? 
Richard McVey: I think you said D-to-D first, but it sounds like you're asking about Market List. So far the hit rates are still pretty low but this is a multi-pronged process to get to the point where more matching could take place. The orders coming in is a great sign to us. And we are starting to see some clients default to making all of their MarketAxess lists publicly available through Market List. We are also seeing a lot of take-up in more investors setting up watch lists to match the bonds that they are trading and most interested in, which will then create alerts for them when other investors are in the market trading those bonds. So we think we're on the right build up here. We have people thinking about creative ways to use Market List to encourage more investor-to-investor matching. On the D-to-D side, since you gave me a small opening there, too. Initially, if you look at our D-to-D platform, we have almost double the number of dealers participating in our dealer-to-dealer system than we do in our client-to-dealer high grade platform. And what that really reflects is that we're starting to connect the institutional dealer market to the retail-dealer market and we're providing a valuable service in terms of allowing the large dealers to move inventory items off of their balance sheet more quickly and get those bonds out to regionals that might be servicing retail customers or very small institutions. That's also part of the new market structure because if we could help those dealers to clear capacity on their balance sheet through our D-to-D solutions, it's then going to free up more capital go back to work in our institutional system with institutional investor orders. So in our mind, all 3 of these things are really interconnected and that is why we're excited about the unique position that we have to provide solutions across all of these different parts of the market. 
Niamh Alexander: And then I guess just lastly. The international offices expansion you had kind of kicked off in Latin America. Initially you were kind of trading a local product -- or trading the international product, but now you're also going to be trading the local product locally. What are the plans for Asia? Are you kind of plowing ahead with that? Or are you going to take it a little bit more slowly there? 
Richard McVey: We are still doing all the work around expanding our EM local market capabilities. We are seeing nice take-up in terms of new Latin American clients coming on the MarketAxess platform and we're getting more local market debt trading done in both Mexico and Brazil. We really want to see those efforts paying off with validation from the market, but at the same time we are studying additional EM local markets and some of those, as you point out, are in Southeast Asia. 
Niamh Alexander: And the access fees. Have you explicitly changed your fee levels at all over the past quarter? 
Antonio DeLise: No, Niamh. We haven't changed the fee schedules. We did have that fee change in Europe back in the first quarter. But no, we haven't changed the fee schedules. And even when you look through that Other category, I know it gets little muddied up when we have 3 different principal products in there. The fee capture individually for emerging markets, high-yield agencies did not swing really with any significance quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, and no, we have not made any fee plan changes in the second quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Justin Hughes from Philadelphia Financials. 
Justin Hughes: I just want to follow-up actually I think on one of Hugh's questions, when he was talking about kind of the weak start to July, although you had some good explanations on why it could pick up. If -- historically, we've seen in kind of quieter periods you've picked up market share, in the real volatile periods market share's maybe pulled back. Do you think that's still the case or is that from kind of dated in year's past and you should be a more net market share grower consistently? 
Antonio DeLise: Where we've seen -- at least in recent times, where we've seen pockets where our market share has slowed down it's been in those times where there's been a significant imbalance in orders. So when you look, say, at February of 2012, October, 2011, those are periods where there was big imbalance in the market and in particular favoring the offer side at a time when dealer balance sheets are at these all time lows. So that probably more than anything else influences, at least in the market share side, it's really that bid offer mix and the big imbalance that could take place. 
Justin Hughes: And you don't see anything like that currently, correct? 
Antonio DeLise: It's interesting you'd say that because at least in July to date, and again 5 important days left, at least what we're seeing in terms of order flow, there is a bit of an imbalance. It looks similar to that February and October timeframe where it's more of, say, a 60-40 split, offers to bids, which in a more historical context would be more challenging from a market share standpoint. But as Rick said, right now our market share for July is trending above the second quarter level. So we'll see what happens the next 5 days, but July is, at least right now, is looking like one of those imbalanced order type months. 
Justin Hughes: Is your read through that it's from maybe some of these large investment banks that have announced new initiatives to try to lower their leverage and take down their balance sheet? I think Deutsche Bank, just yesterday or the day before, said that they're going to try reduce leverage more. Morgan Stanley said they were going to reduce their FICC exposure. Is that what you would read through on that? 
Richard McVey: It is what I would read through, is I think that they are looking for additional ways to participate in client orders while still operating with smaller balance sheets. 
Justin Hughes: And then, related to that if it does end up being a slow second half to the year, would you rethink your expense guidance or you wed to that because of the initiatives you have? 
Antonio DeLise: There is still some variability in that expense number for the second half of the year. And if market volumes continue to trend lower, let's take that sort of scenario, we do have pretty big element of our expense base which is variable. And in particular, that's our variable bonus incentives gain, which is tied directly to operating performance. So sort of in the natural course, if you did see a drop in overall market volumes and even with an increasing market share, a drop in revenues for us, there would be a natural decline in expenses vis-à-vis that incentive bonus. 
Richard McVey: I think just expanding on that a little bit, Justin, given the number of large opportunities that we see in front of us in bonds and in CDS, I don't think you should expect us to radically change our investments during the second half of the year. This is a time where we want to be expanding our capabilities to address the long term opportunities. And while there is some natural variability in our expense base that Tony pointed out, we are committed to making the investments in the solutions that the market really needs to address the changing market structure. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Couple of quick follow-ups. On the dealer-to-dealer, are you able to quantify what percentage of your volume, at this point on the high-grade, is dealer-to-dealer? 
Antonio DeLise: Patrick, we're not sort of disclosing that separately but I will tell you it's a very small, almost negligible portion of our market share. And just to put it in context, if you look at overall second quarter market share, 12.4%. It was about 0.2 of 1%, is what it accounted for. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then on CDS, you talked about how you're not charging for it right now. Do you have a timeline that you're willing to share in terms of when you think you will be at a point where you're ready to charge for that? 
Richard McVey: We do not have a stated timeline on that. We've said that with the cost involved in operating a SEF we would expect that transaction fees on CDS are likely to come into play around the time of implementation of the new regulatory rules but we have not stated any official timeline on that. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Matthew Heinz from Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Matthew Heinz: Just a quick follow-up on the capture rates in the Other segment. It looks like you're trending towards all time highs there, up quarter-over-quarter. Can you just speak a bit on the changes in mix shift and whether the kind of shift towards more emerging market in the high yield has continued in the third quarter? And then also, how much impact has the elimination of CDS volume reporting had on those metrics? 
Antonio DeLise: Matt, on the very last point in terms of the CDS impact, really negligible, if any impact. So as Rick mentioned, we are not reporting CDS volumes in there and even when we looked at it year-over-year, it's just -- where there were some CDS volumes in the second quarter of last year it's sort of a negligible impact. What you've seen here, and Rick mentioned in the prepared notes, we've got EM and high-yield volumes continuing to grow at a pretty healthy pace, both north of 25% year-over-year. And we've had really a moderation on the agency side. So we're not seeing the type of growth in agency bonds that we saw in 2009, 2010, 2011. So that mix has shifted and just to put it in little bit of context, if you went back to last year, say the second quarter of last year, it was probably closer to a 50-50 split. If you took agencies compared to emerging markets and high-yield combined. So about a 50-50 split. And then you fast forward to the second quarter of this year and it's closer to say, 57% or 58% is in emerging markets in high yield and agencies is the residual. So you've seen the shift again, really around the moderation on the agency side and a continued growth in high yield and emerging markets. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We're showing no further questions at this time. So I'll now turn the call back over to Rick. 
Richard McVey: Thanks for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating .You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-25 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. 
David Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. For the call Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our business. And then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results.
 Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.
 For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website.
 Now let me turn the call over to Rick. 
Richard McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2012 results. We are pleased to report another set of strong quarterly results, with record revenues of $50.7 million, up 16% from a year ago, driven by strong credit market trading conditions and increases in market share from the prior year period.
 Pretax income was a record $22.7 million, 29% above the first quarter of 2011. Diluted EPS improved $0.35 compared to $0.27 one year ago. On the heels of significant growth in client inquiry flow, across all trading categories, total trading volume was a record $158 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Emerging market and high yield volumes were both up over 30% from the first quarter of 2011, leading to a 9% improvement in overall fee capture per million traded.
 Slide 4 displays some details on our quarterly results and financial strength. Strong revenue growth in the quarter was the principal driver behind the record pre-tax income of $22.7 million. EBITDA was up 28% to a record $24.6 million in the first quarter of 2012. Operating and EBITDA margins improved to 45% and 49%, respectively. Incremental margin for the quarter was 71%.
 Our cash and securities available for sale balance at March month end was $180 million, or $4.65 per diluted share.
 We continue to return money to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. During the first quarter we repurchased 2.4 million shares, including 1.8 million shares from JP Morgan as part of their sale of shares acquired as a founding dealer of MarketAxess in 2000. We expect the share repurchases to be accretive to earnings and secondary trading liquidity has improved in our shares since the offering. The Board approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share.
 Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. The first quarter of 2012 saw significant improvement in the credit trading environment in both the U.S. and Europe compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, following the introduction of ECB long-term refinancing operation in early 2012.
 Credit spreads and credit spread volatility declined during the quarter as investor sentiment improved and risk appetite increased. The improved market conditions led to record quarter U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes of $864 billion and helping new issuance volumes of $254 billion for the first quarter of 2012.
 Sovereign debt issues have reemerged in Europe in April, and market trends across products in the very early part of the second quarter are softer than the first quarter averages. April volume trends in both high grade and high yield are about 15% below the first quarter of 2012.
 Inflows into bond funds remain strong, in spite of the flattening of the yield curve over the last year. The block trading percentage of TRACE represented 42% of total TRACE volume, down from 46% in the first quarter of 2011. And primary dealer balance sheets are down approximately 52% over the same period.
 Slide 6 highlights our improved client and dealer participation; U.S. high grade investor order count reached a new record during the new quarter and was up 21% from the prior year period. The number of active U.S. high grade trading clients also hit a record during the quarter. Dealer hit rates have be hovering in the 70% range for the past 3 quarters, down from approximately 78% in the first quarter of 2011.
 The level of dealer balance sheets committed to market making provided an ongoing challenge in meeting investor needs to source liquidity, especially during times of order imbalance. We believe the increase in capital requirements for bank affiliated dealers represents a permanent change in dealer balance sheets for market making. We believe we are ideally positioned to provide credit market solutions due to our e-trading technology capabilities and our vast trading network. We are launching new functionality this quarter to enhance Market List, our electronic open order book.
 We have also introduced improvements to our dealer-to-dealer offering to respond to dealer interest in using MarketAxess to increase inventory turnover. While still a small part of our overall results, D2D trades and volume were up over 300% from the first quarter of ’11 and up over 25% sequentially from the fourth quarter.
 Estimated high-grade market share was 11.4% for the first quarter, up 150 basis points from the prior year, but down from 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011. With 4 important trading days still remaining in April, we currently expect April high-grade market share to be around the first quarter level.
 Slide 7 summarizes the trading volume across our product categories. Overall global volume in the first quarter was up 17% year-over-year to $158 billion.
 TRACE volumes set a new quarterly record, but we’re just slightly above the first quarter of 2011. The 15% increase in our U.S. high-grade volume to $98 billion was due solely to market share gains.
 Eurobond volumes were $12.7 billion, the highest in 2 years, and up 13% from the first quarter of last year. The increase reflects improvement in the region’s market conditions and the early signs of support for the fee plan changes we implemented in the first quarter.
 Total trading volume from European clients in the first quarter was approximately $23 billion. Emerging markets and U.S. high-grade trading volume from European clients was up 65% from year ago levels. Our other product category volume increased to a record $47 billion in Q1, up 21% from a year ago, driven principally by high-yield and emerging markets volume gains.
 As previously referenced in our monthly volume statistics reporting, we are no longer reporting CDS volumes in the Other category; however, the first quarter marked our best period ever for CDS trading. We continue to make enhancements to the CDS platform and onboard dealers and clients.
 The regulatory timing continues to shift and we now expect the CFTC SEF rules to be finalized in the second half of 2012. The final Volcker Rules have also been delayed and bank-affiliated dealers will have 2 years to comply with the final rules. As a result, we do not expect any further changes to dealer market making in the near term due to the Volcker Rules.
 Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more detail regarding our financial results. 
Antonio DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Slide 8 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $50.7 million were up 16% from a year ago, driven principally by growth and variable transaction fee commissions. The year-over-year and sequential declines in technology products and services revenues were due to lower professional services fees and the impact of a design shift to a rental model for software sales. Total expenses were $28 million, up 8% from the first quarter of 2011, and 7% sequentially from the fourth quarter.
 First quarter expenses reflect some seasonal and one-time items, which I will cover momentarily. Pretax income was a record $22.7 million in the first quarter, up 29% from last year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 40.7%, up from 39% in the first quarter of 2011. We're trending towards the higher end of our 2012 tax guidance range, due principally to a decline in foreign source income.
 Our diluted earnings per share was $0.35 on 38.7 million diluted shares. On Slide 9 we have laid out our commission revenues, trading volumes, and fees per million. Distribution fees were $16.1 million during the first quarter of 2012, up 6% from the first quarter of 2011, but down 4% sequentially from the fourth quarter.
 On our fourth quarter call, we flagged the distribution fee reduction on our major Eurobond fee plan as well as several dealers, including MF Global, that were coming off of the major U.S. high-grade fee plan. In addition to these changes, one more U.S. dealer has migrated to the all-variable plan at the beginning of the second quarter.
 Absent any other changes, compared to the first quarter 2012 level, distribution fees are projected to decline by approximately $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2012. We expect some offsetting benefits in variable transaction fees relating to this most recent dealer migration. U.S. high-grade fees per million were $188 million first quarter, which was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2011, but up from $172 in the first quarter of 2011.
 The year-over-year change was primarily due to an increase in the duration of bonds traded and an increase in volume derived from broker dealer client on the all-variable plan. There is some noise in the Eurobond fee capture in the first quarter as we were transitioning dealers to the new fee plan.
 Given the current mix of corporate and government bond trading on our platform and fee plans in place, we expect that our Eurobond fee capture will continue to average around $65 per million. The Other product category fees per million were $202 in the first quarter of 2012, up from $166 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $176 in the first quarter of 2011.
 The sequential and year-over-year increases in fees per million was due to product mix shift in this category, resulting principally from significant growth in emerging markets and high-yield volume.
 Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. Total expenses for the first quarter were $28 million, up 8% from a year ago. Excluding a sale tax reimbursement claim of $700,000 recorded in the first quarter of 2011, expenses were up 5% year over year.
 The first quarter 2012 expenses include approximately $200,000 of costs associated with the JPMorgan secondary offering and seasonally higher payroll taxes and advertising spend. We continue to expect that our full year 2012 expenses will be within our original guidance range of $107 million to $112 million.
 On Slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash-equivalents, and securities available for sale as of March 31st were $180 million compared to $248 million at year end 2011. In addition to paying out our annual incentive bonuses during the first quarter, we also returned $75 million to shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly dividend. The trailing 12 months' pre-cash flow for the period ended March 31, was $70 million. Our capital structure now consists of a single class of voting stock, and we continue to have no bank debt.
 Slide 12 gives an update on share repurchases and changes in our shareholder base. Since mid-December 2011, we have repurchased a total of 2.6 million shares of common stock. We expect that our second quarter diluted share count will reflect the full impact of these recent share repurchases and at current share price levels, would expect it to be approximately 37.8 million shares. There is 10 million in authorized repurchases remaining under our $35 million program, which at this point, we would expect to use opportunistically.
 The JPMorgan secondary offering marked another step in increasing the public slope and diversity of our shareholders. In the past 3 years, the average daily trading volume in MarketAxess shares is up more than 5 times, and the average daily dollar value of MarketAxess shares traded is up 15 times.
 Now let me turn the call back over to Rick. 
Richard McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the record results from the first quarter. Trading volume and revenue momentum is evident in many of our product areas, and we continue to demonstrate operating leverage. The changes taking place in fixed income will require new solutions, and we'll ultimately increase the addressable market for electronic trading.
 In closing today, I would like to extend a very personal thank you to Nick Rohatyn, our lead independent director. After playing an instrumental role in the founding of our business, and 12 years of service on the MarketAxess board, Nick has decided to step down following the end of the current term in June. It has been a privilege to work with Nick through our formative years, and all shareholders have benefited from his vision, advice, and support. We will continue to call on Nick as a friend and fellow shareholder for years to come, even though his official responsibilities as a director will soon come to an end.
 Our nominating and governance committee has successfully recruited 2 new outstanding directors to our board. Jim Sullivan is the head of Fixed Income at Prudential Investment Management, and an industry leader in credit markets. Steve Begleiter is a senior principal at Flexpoint Ford, a private equity group. Steve has extensive investment banking and business building experience. We welcome both Jim and Steve to our board, and we look forward to working with them.
 Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question will be coming from the line of Howard Chen from Credit Suisse. 
Howard Chen: Just a couple of fee, quick questions. First, Rick, you spoke to the really high growth in inquiry count during the quarter, and we can see that on Slide 6. Could you elaborate a bit more exactly where that's coming from, and what your expectations are going forward in terms of growth in inquiry count? 
Richard McVey: Yes. I think it's a couple of things. I think it reflects that in our normal sweet spot for trading activity, we're seeing an increase coming in from existing clients. We continue to work on clients that we think are under-utilizing the platform, and we have made progress with many of them with respect to the increase in activity.
 And as we also mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen very good growth in inquiry count from cross-regional clients, most notably out of Europe. So I think it's really been across the board, and it has been the primary driver of the increases in market share. 
Howard Chen: And then shifting over to Europe, I just wanted to dig in to some of that outlook and commentary on the variable pricing. I guess I don't quite understand what exactly is going on that's driving that reduced outlook to kind of the 65 level. So if you could please elaborate on that, that would be great. 
Antonio DeLise: Sure, Howard. It's Tony. There's a couple of things in there. Probably the first thing to note is that when we look at our Euro bond volume, it really is a combination of corporate bonds and government bonds. The way our fee plan works right now, corporate bonds are generally at 100 per million and government bonds are at 10 per million. So that mix definitely influences the fee capture.
 The second one, which is a little bit of a nuance, we did have a number of dealers who were on a hybrid plan, sort of similar to our U.S. high grade all-variable plan. We had several dealers who were on a hybrid plan paying a reduced fixed monthly distribution fee, a variable fee, and then an execution fee.
 We've now centered really around one fee plan that now eliminates that execution fee that some of these hybrid plan dealers were paying. So that hybrid execution fee was influencing fee capture prior to the fee plan change. And that's why looking at it going forward, it's really just a mix of corporate at 100 and government bonds at 10. Depending on that mixed set, $65 guidance could swing higher or lower.
 And I will tell you we are also very active in on-boarding new dealers. These would, in all likelihood, be sort of more regional dealers out of Europe. They would likely be on an all-variable plan, so that also could influence the fee capture going forward. But at least right now in terms of near-term guidance, think about it more around that $65 or $70 range. 
Howard Chen: That's very helpful, Tony. Finally, Rick, thanks for the update on the CDS and timing as you think about it. I just wanted a little more of an update. Are you charging today, and if not, how do you think about adjusting that fee schedule over time as you gain traction and share within that market? 
Richard McVey: Sure. No, we do not have any fee schedule in place today for CDS. And quite honestly, there are enough uncertainties in the final SEF rules and the timing of implementation that we do not expect to change that policy in the near term. We're doing the best we can with uncertain information about the rules to prepare the trading system in every respect to be ready to register as a SEF. And, Howard, I would expect that the fee model and fee capture will probably become more clear around the time that the SEF rules go fully into place. 
Operator: Your next question will be coming from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: First thing I wanted to ask you is, Rick, if I heard you correctly you said that April to date your U.S. high grade market share is running around 11.4%, basically what you did in the first quarter? 
Richard McVey: That's correct. We said it's around the first quarter levels. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: OK. So if that's the case, it seems like over the last few months your market share has stalled out a little bit, and certainly the long-term trend has been positive, but are you seeing some near-term headwinds that are kind of preventing you from seeing that next uptick? 
Richard McVey: No. You're correct, Patrick, we've been a little bit flat here over the last couple of periods after a pretty steep increase. And as you know from history here, as well as all the other companies that you’ve covered, nothing ever moves completely in a straight line. But we're pretty excited about the future.
 We do think that the long-term trend in block trading is reflecting a decline. We expect that to continue, given the capital requirements and the dealer balance sheet constraints. We continue to promote the price improvements that investors are achieving on the MarketAxess system, due to the level of competition on the platform.
 We're really excited about the early signs of take-up in D2D trading, and the enthusiasm that the dealer community has for the enhancements that we're putting into place this quarter. As you know, D2D trading typically represents somewhere around 25% to 28% of TRACE.
 So when we put all of those things together, along with some of the enhancements that we're making to market lists and the regulatory trends, we feel pretty optimistic that the electronics share is going to continue to grow over the next 2 or 3 years. It's difficult to predict quarter-in and quarter-out, what that path will look like, but we like the outlook. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: OK. That's fair. Next question. As far as the other categories fee capture, it sounds like you just had a really favorable mix shift.
 Is that a mix shift that you think is sustainable, going forwards? 
Antonio DeLise: Yes. Patrick, you're right. It was a pretty marked mix shift.
 Just to put it in perspective, we had the 3 main products in that category, which are emerging markets, high yield, and agencies. Just looking at 2011, you look at emerging markets and high yield, higher margin or higher fee capture products, they represented something like 46% or 47% of the volume in that category.
 We fast forward to the first quarter, and emerging markets and high yield were more like 55%. That's what really drove the significant out-performance in fee capture. It is sustainable at least.
 You heard some comments from Rick around, you know, where volumes are trending for April, again, very early in the month. High-yield TRACE volumes are down around 15%. Hard to gauge where emerging market values are.
 We've seen the same thing in agency volumes, where again, they're trending down from the first quarter levels. Where we're most excited really, it is around emerging markets anti-yield. We think that we can continue to grow market share there.
 Having said that, all three products are growing, so we're going to have to suffer a bit through the products mix shift as we go forward. At least where we are today, and what we're seeing in terms of increased client participation across product, again it's hard to say whether we can sustain this volume mix, but at least, in the near term it looks pretty favorable. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Then Tony, following up on the distribution fees, I think you said all told it is going to drop by about a million and a half in the second quarter.
 I think I have that roughly right. Then, most of that is going to be in the Eurobond distribution fees, but some of it's also going to be in the U.S. high-grade, does that sound right? 
Antonio DeLise: Yes, Patrick what I said is what we think it will drop based on what we know today, we think it will drop by about $1.8 million versus the first quarter level and think of it as a, sort of a 2/3, 1/3 split between the U.S. and Europe, U.S, being 2/3 of that number around $1.2 million and Europe being 1/3 or around $600 thousand. And what we have here in the U.S, there's two dealers that at the very end of the first quarter, very beginning of the second quarter migrated off of the fixed plan into the variable plan. Both were paying $200 thousand per month.
 You look at the second quarter impact it's around $1.2 million, and on the European side we do have the carry-over impact from the March 1st feed plan change. The impact there, quite frankly, is a little bit less than what we had anticipated.
 There are several dealers who have yet to migrate from paying $50 thousand Euros per month to $25 thousand Euros per month, so the impact in Europe is a little bit lower than what we had originally anticipated but $1.8 million in total impact.
 And Patrick, I say again, it's based on what we know today. I mentioned before that we're hoping to onboard some European dealers, all be it most of those we think will be all variable plan dealers. We have the same thing in the U.S. where we're in the middle of on-boarding a number of new dealers.
 There's also several dealers who are on the variable plan right now that may or may not upgrade to the fixed plan, yet to be seen. So there is some movement here in between plans and in the distribution fees. But at least, based on what we know today, that's the best guidance we can give for Q2. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All right, gotcha, and then one last modeling question, if I could. On the technology products and services revenue line item, it sounds like you changed your business model a little bit there in terms of how you charge. So is the $2.9 million that you put up in terms of revenue in the first quarter kind of the new run rate going forward? 
Antonio DeLise: It's a good question, Patrick, and it really is really the new sort of data point or baseline that we would suggest modeling off of. And there's 2 things there. It's not only the shift in the revenue model. So previously software sales were a onetime revenue event, so one time license event in the month that you booked the license and delivered the software you recorded the revenue.
 Beginning in the fourth quarter we began to shift to a revenue model, which we believe is beneficial long term increases reoccurring revenue, we think it's the right thing for the business. Definitely some short terms paying when you do that, so that is one item driving it. And really the second item, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that the professional services fees were down versus the fourth quarter level.
 We are making some adjustments in our professional services focus areas, some geographic adjustments. And that's why when you look at Q1, we really think that would be the new data point or the jumping off point for tech services going forward. 
Operator: Your next question will be coming from the line of Hugh Miller from Sidoti and Company. 
Hugh Miller: I guess I had one in housekeeping about the tax rate. It seemed to kind of come in at a touch higher than what we've seen in the past, and just your expectation going forward for that. 
Antonio DeLise: Sure. Sure. There are lots of estimates that go into a tax rate, and the single biggest one is projecting out for the full year income by taxing jurisdiction. So you have to make some estimates going forward. You're also estimating out levels of permanent differences like meals and entertainment, which are non-deductible, and tax-free interest.
 You could also have discrete items that impact the tax rate, like a tax rate change or an audit inclusion. But when you look at where we are in the first quarter, 40.7%, and even if you compare it to the full year 2011, which was around 39.5%, it's definitely up. And 2 items in particular; the biggest one is the reduction in foreign source income.
 So for us foreign source income is predominantly coming out of the U.K. Within our provision it's taxed at 35%. You compare that to U.S. source income, which is taxed at something above 40%. So when you take federal plus a state impact, something above 40%. That mix of U.S. and foreign source income is a big factor, and the biggest factor in why our tax rate is up.
 The second thing is, at least right now, Congress has not extended or acted to extend the research credit. We have some pretty substantial expenses around our capitalized software and improvements that we're making to the trading platform around CDS and D2D and open trading and all the other initiatives we have on.
 But right now since Congress hasn't acted, we can't build that into the effective tax rate. So right now it is trending at the higher end of the range, but, Hugh, there's things that could happen if Congress acted on the research credit.
 There are other favorable permanent differences around option exercises that could influence the rate. But again, based on the projections right now, it looks like we're trending at that higher end. 
Hugh Miller: All right. Great color there. And I know you guys reiterated your expense guidance for the year. I was just wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color on some of the geographic expansion efforts that you are taking upon you now and how that might influence costs, if there's much in the way of costs associated with that? 
Antonio DeLise: Sure, Hugh. I'll tackle the first part on the expense guidance. Let me give you a little more color on that. Within the expense guidance, it does include some of this geographic expansion that we have going on, predominantly in Brazil and in Southeast Asia.
 We reiterated our guidance, $107 million, $112 million for the full year.
 If you take that Q1 expenses, there's definitely a couple of one-time items, and some seasonal items in there that wouldn't make Q1, really, be a normal run rate. We did have the JP Morgan offering cost in there for $200,000. There's definitely some seasonal payroll taxes that do run through the first quarter.
 In order of magnitude on that one, for 2011, payroll taxes in the first quarter were $700,000 higher than Q2 through Q4. That's because we have the way FICO works, and we have restrictive stock vesting in the first quarter, that generates employer taxes. That's definitely a big seasonal item. Even to a lesser extent, on our advertising spend in the first quarter, particularly, around CDS, was higher than what we would have expect going forward.
 We also had a bad debt charge at our technology services group, which we hope to reverse in future periods. We have a very formula driven bad debt reserve policy right now, when something ages out not so gracefully, we end up reserving for it.
 When you tally up these items, it comes out to somewhere around a $1 million. If you take that $1 million off of the first quarter expenses that would get you a jumping off rate of something like $27 million for the quarter. Just in terms of overall guidance, if we make some adjustments to the first quarter, again, it gets you to somewhere around $27 million.
 Baked into our forward-looking estimates, that does include some of this geographic expansion; some of those expenses are already built in, even in the first quarter. We did open the office in Brazil, we have staffed up that office. We do have several people already on the ground in Singapore and Hong Kong. There's a couple of hires that will come on board as we go throughout the year. Again, baked into the guidance does include some of the geographic expansion, as well. 
Hugh Miller: OK. Great color.
 Moving into the color and detail you gave us with regards to the shift in the 2 dealers on the U.S. high-grade platform, going to variable from the all-you-can-trade option. I was wondering if you’re getting a sense as to what's causing them to make that change, and I realize the next question will be dependent of volumes from them, but do you anticipate that shift is going to be somewhat revenue neutral do you know in the second quarter or not? 
Antonio DeLise: Let me clear up on the 2 dealers, because in one case, and this was one that we had previously flagged, it's a dealer that had ramped up, in response to the credit crisis several years ago, ramped up a debt. They have closed down the debt. So in that one particular case, we don't think that there's going to be a variable revenue offset. So that's one of them.
 And the second one that just migrated off the beginning of the second quarter, yes, we do think that there will be a variable revenue offset. The way many of the dealers work on the variable plan, there is a minimum commitment. It's not quite what they were paying in terms of their distribution fee, but we do think there will be a revenue offset. It might not be exactly one to one, but there should be a revenue offset for that one. 
Hugh Miller: OK. Great. And then the last question I had was just with regards to, we've had a little bit of time since some of the news that hit the papers again about BlackRock's offering for a client-to-client trading platform. I was just wondering if you could give us your sense on any potential competition that you could foresee from that over time and your thoughts there. 
Richard McVey: Yes, I’d be happy to take that one, Hugh. I do think the discussions around the crossing network are reflective of growth and interest among all investors in promoting and establishing alternative sources of liquidity and moving toward a more open and electronic model for fixed income. And quite honestly, what BlackRock has said publicly about their intentions doesn't overlap significantly with what we do.
 And our own view is that any increase in electronic connectivity in credit markets will ultimately be a good thing for both MarketAxess and the overall market. So we have seen broad based support in the new initiatives that we have around market lists and some of our initiatives to complement dealer liquidity with open order books. We think we're on the right track there, and we are seeing very good early signs of support around those initiatives and some others that have come up along the way. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your next question is coming from the line of Matthew Heinz from Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Matthew Heinz: I'm wondering if I can just get an update on some of the new initiatives you highlighted at the investor day, primarily revolving around the retail initiative and the client-to-client open trading. 
Richard McVey: Yes, happy to comment on those. The D2D initiative, as we've said in the past, is mostly focused on helping dealers clean up smaller balance sheet items, and this is directly related to the new regulatory capital requirements. In the old model, dealers were perfectly happy to sit on thousands of line items, many of which might've been 3 million and under, and wait until they found a client order on the other side.
 That has changed entirely, and there's more interest now in using any possible channel to move those inventory items along more quickly. So mostly what we're seeing is an interest in using MarketAxess, and specifically our list functionality, to move smaller line items, typically 3 and 4 million and under, out through the system.
 It serves as a product pipeline for lots of regional dealers that may have an end investor order that the large dealers are not seeing, and I think it's a very positive development for us. And it's a way that we can add value back to the dealers in light of the capital requirement changes that they are facing.
 On the market list side there was a lot of interest in opening up orders on the MarketAxess system throughout 2008. Market liquidity improved in '09 and 2010, and the vast majority of business went back to the traditional channel between investors and dealers.
 There's more interest again in complementing dealer liquidity with the open order book. We've made some enhancements to our market list functionality so that it's streamlined, and we believe will be more efficient for all market participants to use, and many of those enhancements and changes are going out this quarter. 
Matthew Heinz: OK. And then one follow-up on the BlackRock network. Just wanted to get your incremental thoughts on how that could impact you, not so much from a competition standpoint, but more on how it could impact the volume that BlackRock currently does on your platform? 
Richard McVey: What they’ve said again, Matt, is that they're focused on crossing block trades within their own portfolios. What you and others saw last week was clarification that they have pretty modest expectations in terms of the amount of business that can ultimately be crossed because of the level of fragmentation and illiquidity in most corporate bonds.
 So I think at the margin that they expect to get some benefit from this. They've been clear that they don't have any interest in this hitting the Street. They don't expect to become a broker dealer, so we view what they're doing as complementary to what we do on the MarketAxess system. And, as I mentioned, we think there are ways that we can increase electronic connectivity with all major clients in the years ahead. 
Matthew Heinz: OK.  And then one quick follow-up to that. Have you seen any more major institutional clients that are implementing similar minimum sized requirements, like BlackRock has, that require certain smaller trade sizes to go through MarketAxess? 
Richard McVey: We aren't privy really, to the internal policies of any of our clients. I think it's pretty clear by the growth in our market share that more and more investors are embracing the notion that a greater percentage of their trading should be done electronically.
 We think that if we continue to deliver efficient functionality that allows them to access broader sources of liquidity through these changing times, that we will be successful in continuing to grow our share. We really, we don't have anything that we know specifically about internal policies but we can see very clearly not just in high-grade, but across almost all of our major product categories, that there is a trend toward greater electronic trading in credit. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from a line of Niahm Alexander from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. 
Niamh Alexander: If I could just, this on this kind of potential for other venues and to be out there. I mean, it's taken you a long time and a lot of client relationships to get to where you are. Didn't MarketAxess also at one point set up the functionality for buy side to match buy side and it's just very challenging. Is that fair?  People have to kind of shield their liquidity and I'm just trying to get a sense of how difficult it really could be for somebody like a BlackRock or even competitors to come out and do something. 
Richard McVey: That's right, Niahm. When we do the deep dive on TRACE, even if you had access to 100% of the client orders during the day you wouldn't see a huge percentage of matching opportunities, and it is reflective of the nature of the securities in credit that they trade infrequently. In fact, a vast majority of corporate bonds that are reported to TRACE only trade one time per day. So, there's a limited universe of more liquid bonds that could create some matching opportunities.
 We think the Market List functionality and a few other things that we can do to compliment what we do with multi-dealer liquidity today are very positive steps in that direction. But you're right. The total matching opportunity, because of the illiquidity in the market, is relatively small. 
Niamh Alexander: OK. Fair enough. Thanks for clarifying, Rick.
 And then, if I could go to Europe, because you saw, I guess we have another step down in price, but for a very short time, it was very good over there. I mean, you're starting to see corporate issuance and finally this intermediation of bank lending and the stuff you showed us at the analyst day for the quarter were looking really good in terms of volume. Is that fair?
 When things normalized you did see there is potential for a significant lift to the revenue base there, just from the activity. Is it more kind of the industry activity or is it still more your market position right now that's kind of limiting the growth there? 
Richard McVey: Well, 2 things on that. We do think we have a much larger opportunity in Europe. We've said in the past that we need to do a better job delivering unique liquidity in technology solutions. We've been fast at work on that every quarter. We did see a significant turnaround during the first quarter, but the market over there continues to be very volatile and very sensitive to sentiment shifts around sovereign debt concerns.
 You would know more about that than we would, Niahm, but our guess is that's here to stay. This is not going to be solved in a quarter or 2, and that over the next 2 or 3 years we're going to be faced with these swings in investor sentiment that radically change the risk appetite and liquidity in the market.
 We'll see positive periods as we did during the first quarter. We are optimistic that all of the initiatives to provide backstop funding for European sovereigns will ultimately pay off along with the fiscal responses that are working their way through the European region. But it's not going to happen overnight. I think we will see ebbs and flows in sentiment and market activity over the next few years. 
Niamh Alexander: OK. Fair enough, Rick. Then, lastly, on the revenue side again. You are seeing phenomenal growth in the revenue line, helped by the emerging markets and the high yield. That seems to be where a lot of the flows are going this year as well. You've had to pick up in the rate capture, do you think that it's within your sights that maybe that product category could at some point exceed the core kind of high-grade category in the next two to three years? 
Richard McVey: Well, we're pleased with the growth. If you're looking for a forecast of where that is going, I think the best we can do is be transparent with you on the trends and the fee models as the other category has consistently been outstripping the growth percentage in volume in the high-grade category.
 We do like the fact that we're seeing the market share trend coming through across more products more clearly now than we may have 2 years ago. As we've said many times, you know, with EM and a high yield, the market is at an earlier stage in embracing electronic trading, so we do think there is a significant growth opportunity there. We think we're on the right track. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] 
Richard McVey: It sounds like there are no further questions. So thanks very much for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-01 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 1st, 2012. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead sir. 
Dave Cresci: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter 2011 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The Company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2010. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick. 
Richard McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our 2011 results. This morning, we reported our fourth-quarter financial results, capping off a year of strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue of $45.1 million was up 17% from a year ago and pretax income of $18.9 million was 31% above the fourth quarter of 2010. Diluted EPS improved to $0.29 compared to $0.23 one year ago. These results were achieved in spite of softer industry trading volumes during the quarter. In addition, the failure of MF Global during the quarter resulted in lower distribution fees of approximately $400,000, and higher expenses of approximately $950,000 due to the full write-off of MF Global receivables. Total trading volume was $125 billion, up 20% from a year ago, driven by strong gains in market share. Our estimated high-grade market share reached 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011, up strongly from 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Increases in investor order flow continue to drive these market share gains
 Slide 4 displays some details on our annual results and financial strength. Strong year-over-year revenue growth, coupled with moderate expense increases, continue to drive record annual earnings. Since the credit crisis in 2008, we have reported 3 consecutive years of revenue growth in excess of 20% and EPS growth in excess of 50%. EBITDA was up 49% to $86 million for 2011. Operating and EBITDA margins of 44% and 47% respectively again hit record levels in 2011. Incremental margin for the full year was 80%. In light of the strong growth in earnings, and free cash flow of almost $60 million in 2011, our Board of Directors has declared an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.11 per share from $0.09. Our cash and securities balance at December month end was $248 million, or $6.22 per diluted share. We spent $6.9 million to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter under the $35 million share repurchase program.
 Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. An increase in credit spreads and credit spread volatility combined with a further decline in primary dealer balance sheets led to an overall decline in TRACE volumes during the fourth quarter. We believe the European debt concerns weighed heavily on the market, causing an overall reduction in risk appetite for credit. Market conditions in both the US and Europe have gotten off to a much better start in early 2012 following the introduction of the ECB long-term refinancing operation. Spreads have moved tighter and secondary volumes are on pace with the record first quarter of 2011. We expect to release our January trading volumes later this week once the FINRA TRACE volumes have been finalized. Those results will show a new record for monthly average daily trading volumes. Our US high-grade estimated market share will be below the December and fourth-quarter 2011 levels following the normal seasonal pattern. The reduction in primary dealer balance sheets is leading to lower average trade sizes in the corporate bond market and a lower percentage of TRACE volume in block trade sizes. Investors continue to seek out alternative sources of liquidity, leading to an increase in trades done with new dealer counter-parties. These market changes, combined with new regulatory initiatives, continue to support greater electronic trading in credit markets.
 Slide 6 highlights our improved client and dealer participation. The increase in trading connections on the MarketAxess system is allowing dealers and investors to find unique trading opportunities. Investor order count reached a new record during the quarter in spite of the fact that TRACE high-grade volume was down 13% from the third quarter. New dealers added to our system since the third quarter of 2008 accounted for approximately 28% of the trading by count and a record 21% of trading by volume during the fourth quarter, representing an important addition of liquidity for investors. Our transaction cost savings estimates show a meaningful reduction in investor execution costs on MarketAxess versus phone-based trades on TRACE. The decline in hit rates or percentage of orders resulting in a trade reflects the more challenging market environment over the second half of 2011. We have seen an increase in hit rates with the improved market conditions in January.
 Slide 7 summarizes the trading volume across our product categories. Full-year 2011 global volume was $525 billion, up 31% over 2010. Overall global volume in the fourth quarter was up 20% year-over-year to $125 billion. Despite a 7% decline in TRACE volumes from year-ago levels, our US high-grade volume was $75 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Eurobond volumes were down 25% from the fourth quarter of last year, continuing to reflect the uncertainty in the region's markets. By contrast, European clients trading of US high-grade and emerging market instruments on MarketAxess rose strongly during last year and was up over 40% from 2010 levels. We are confident that we can grow Eurobond volumes longer-term, and we will reduce our Eurobond monthly dealer distribution fees by 50% effective March 1st, in recognition of the difficult trading conditions and current level of investor flows in this category. In January, we have seen a rebound of Eurobond volumes from weak second-half levels. The Other product category volumes increased to $42 billion in the fourth quarter, up 38% from a year ago with the strongest growth coming from our agency product. For the full-year 2011, trading in our Other product category was up 52% with strong growth across all 3 main products, emerging markets, high yield, and agencies. CDS trading is our single largest investment area, and regulatory delays aside, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the electronic trading of swaps. The CFTC and SEC have pushed the expected SEF rules finalization beyond the first quarter of 2012. These delays would suggest that implementation dates are now likely to come toward the end of 2012. Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more detail regarding our financial results. 
Antonio DeLise: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for some perspective on our full year results. The 2011 performance highlights the operating leverage in our business. Compared to 2010, revenue was up 24% and pretax income was up 55%. Operating margin for the full year expanded to 44%, up strongly from 35% in 2010. $0.80 of every additional revenue dollar we earned in 2011 versus 2010 fell directly to pretax income. Overall US high-grade TRACE volumes were flat again in 2011. The majority of the revenue increase was derived from market share gains and the positive distribution fee impact from dealers migrating to the major US dealer fee plan.
 Slide 9 displays our quarterly earnings performance. Revenues of $45.1 million were up 17% from a year ago, driven principally by trading commission growth. Total expenses were $26.3 million, up 9% from both the fourth quarter of 2010 and sequentially from the third quarter. Fourth-quarter expenses reflect several one-time charges aggregating $1.5 million, which I will cover momentarily. Pre-tax income was $18.9 million in the fourth quarter, up 31% from last year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 39% and consistent with our full-year tax rate. Our diluted EPS was $0.29 on 39.8 million diluted shares. Buybacks under our share repurchase plan were initiated in mid-December and had a minor impact on the fourth-quarter diluted share count.
 On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Distribution fees were $16.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2011, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2010. As expected, during the fourth quarter, 2 additional dealers moved to the major plan. The impact of this movement in the US was offset by the loss of MF Global, a dealer on the major US high-grade plan. As Rick mentioned, we'll be reducing our Eurobond distribution fees by 50% effective March 1st. We expect that Eurobond distribution fees will decline by approximately $450,000 per month. In addition, 2 dealers in the US have or will be migrating off of the major US high-grade plan. Absent any other changes compared to the fourth-quarter level, distribution fees are projected to decline by approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2012. US high-grade fees per million were $190 in the fourth quarter and consistent with the third quarter and prior year. Our US high-grade variable transaction fees are dependent in part on the individual trade size. The expected decline in fee capture resulting from the 2 dealer migrations to the major plan at the beginning of the fourth quarter was offset by a shift in mix favoring smaller trade sizes. The Other product category fee captured decreased from $175 per million in the third quarter of 2011 to $166 per million in the fourth quarter. The sequential and year-over-year decline in fees per million was due to product mix shift.
 Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Total expenses for the fourth quarter were $26.3 million, up 9% from a year ago. The full-year 2011 expenses of $102 million were in line with the updated guidance we provided in October, but there were several items of note during the fourth quarter. We recorded a 100% reserve against accounts receivable due from MF Global, and a write-off of a minority investment. These 2 charges totaled $1.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the aggregate. Also during the fourth quarter, we adjusted the incentive bonus provision downward which resulted in lower-than-anticipated compensation and benefits expense. The final 2011 bonus provision of $20 million represented a 13% increase over the 2010 level.
 On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash equivalents, and securities available for sale as of December 31 were $248 million compared to $198 million at year-end 2010 and $238 million at September 30, 2011. We spent $6.9 million in the fourth quarter on the share repurchase plan. As a reminder, we believe that available unrestricted federal tax loss and credit carry forwards have now been exhausted. Carry-forward availability reduced our federal tax liability by approximately $13 million in 2011. We expect an increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2012 and subsequent years. We currently expect the balance of the share repurchase plan will be completed over the next several months. Assuming we complete the plan as scheduled and our share price remains stable, once completed, we expect our diluted share count to be approximately 38.8 million. We also anticipate that, when completed, the buyback will add approximately $0.01 per diluted share in quarterly earnings. There was no change in our capital structure during the fourth quarter and we continue to have no bank debt.
 On Slide 13, we have our 2012 expense, capital expenditure and income tax rate guidance. We expect that total expenses will be in the range of $107 million to $112 million. The midpoint in that range is consistent with our five-year compound annual growth rate in expenses of approximately 6%. We anticipate that expenses will show a modest sequential ramp throughout 2012. Capital expenditures include computer software and equipment, together with capitalized software development costs associated with trading platform enhancements and new products. The anticipated increase in our CapEx spending in 2012 is due to an expected build out of a new disaster recovery site. We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2012 will be between 39% and 41%. Among other items, the mix of US and foreign sourced income and changes in tax rates could cause variations in the effective tax rate. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. 
Richard McVey: Thank you, Tony. We are pleased to report another very strong year for revenue and earnings growth. We believe that market structure and regulatory changes are driving a demonstrable increase in demand for electronic trading in credit markets. In addition to our strong competitive position in core products today, we are investing actively in new product areas. Our revenue growth is allowing us to invest in new products, grow earnings, and returns more free cash flow to our investors through dividends and share repurchases. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication to serving our customers again in 2011. We expect 2012 to be another exciting year for developments in the e-trading space.
 Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen from Credit Suisse. 
Howard Chen: Rick, Tony, just a question on -- [indiscernible]. Tony, just on the expense guidance, I hear you on the sort of consistent growth rate over the last 5 years. But given that the midpoint is a good bit above second-half run rate last year, could you give a little more detail on which kind of line items you expect an increase in expenses? 
Antonio DeLise: Sure. I'd be happy to. On that expense guidance - and again, in the prepared remarks, I mentioned that the midpoint was consistent with our five-year compound annual growth rate. And when we look at expenses, around 60% of our expenses consistently come from the compensation and benefits line. And that line, probably more than any other line in our income statement, that's where you're going to see the growth in expenses. It won't be an immediate growth beginning in the first quarter. There will be some ramp up throughout the year, but that is the single biggest line where you will see expense growth. The second biggest line where you are going to see expense growth is in the depreciation and amortization line. If you look at all of our other expenses, those are expected really to be flat. On the depreciation and amortization line, we do have some expenses there associated with our data center build out. Some of that depreciation will hit in 2012. And even when you look at our capitalized software development spend, particularly in 2011 and what we expect to capitalize in 2012, it is significantly higher than prior years. When that amortization starts rolling into our depreciation line, that's where you're going to see an uptick. So again, picking out the 2 individual line items, by far the bigger one will be the compensation and benefits line, and then second one down the road, depreciation and amortization. 
Howard Chen: Great. That's very helpful. And just moving onto credit markets here, with regards to the mix shift toward smaller trade sizes, as we maybe see dealer balance sheets improve over time, risk appetite returns to the market, do you anticipate any reversals there? And how do you think that would impact your market share? 
Richard McVey: I think our belief is that the new capital requirements are likely to keep dealer balance sheets lower than they have been in the past. And interestingly enough, undoubtedly risk appetite is up to start the New Year with the improved market conditions in January. However, there's absolutely no sign that primary dealer balance sheets are increasing for corporate bond trading. So our expectation is that these changes are more permanent, and that dealers are going to operate their corporate bond trading operations with much smaller balance sheets than they have in the past. That is being reflected in the TRACE data when you see the decline in the percentage of TRACE volume being done in block trades, and the gradual reduction of the average trade size in TRACE. 
Howard Chen: Great. And just lastly for me, I think what you mentioned earlier, you're seeing an ongoing change basically in favor of e-trading. Maybe give us a sense of, in percentage terms, how much the market has moved over the last 2 to 3 years, and kind of where you ultimately see the percentage of trades that are traded electronically in the next 3 to 5 years. 
Richard McVey: Yeah, well, we certainly see an acceleration of estimated market share gains in US high-grade over the last 3 years, with another very strong increase in market share last year. And it's our belief when we look inside the TRACE data, primarily at the type of trades that investors are most comfortable doing electronically, which tends to be in the $5 million and under trade size category, that electronic trading over time will consume most of those $5 million in under trades. And recently, the $5 million and under trade size business has been representing more than half of all TRACE volume. Admittedly some of that is in the dealer-to-dealer space, but a significant portion is in the client-to-dealer space. So it's our view that the combination of the investor transaction costs improvement and the trading efficiency and the ability to reach more dealer counter-parties will continue to drive a higher market share of electronic trading in the years ahead. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So to circle back on expenses, Tony, can you give us the starting point or the run rate for compensation expense as we enter in 2012? So it sounds like you had, you kind of backed out some bonus accrual in the fourth quarter of '11 and you did in the third quarter of '11 as well. So where is a good starting point for 2012? 
Antonio DeLise: Patrick, when looking at the comp and benefits line, there was definitely some noise around the bonus provision over the second half of the year. And I think what you've got to look at is the -that comp and benefits ratio for the full year 2011, which was around 32% or 33%.That's what we are looking at going forward, something in that range and then going down as our revenues accelerate. But think about that jumping-off point, you’re more consistent with the full-year comp and benefits ratio. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay. That's helpful. And then something you mentioned on the prepared remarks, you have 2 dealers migrating off of the major dealer plan and back onto the regional dealer plan. Can you give some more explanation? It's a somewhat unusual event for you guys. 
Antonio DeLise: It's the first time we've had it, but I think, given what's going on the regulatory side and capital requirements and the Volcker rule, we should expect to see some movement here and going forward. And we had - in the prepared remarks, we referenced MF Global, certainly something nobody anticipated with that particular event. And then the 2 dealers now that are migrating off, they will migrate onto the all-variable plan. And there's pockets of liquidity that have been created post-crisis and there's changes in business models that occur and that's going to happen. Right now we have 27 dealers on the major plan. There will be some movement up and down, but Patrick, your observation is correct. It's the first time we've had it, so it does look a bit unusual here. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay. So you guys guided for the US distribution fees to be down in the first quarter of 2012. If we assume a similar mix for US high-grade trading in terms of average trade size and average duration, because these 2 firms are migrating from the major dealer plan to the regional dealer plan, we should expect the fee capture for US high-grade to go up in the first quarter of 2012. Is that correct? 
Antonio DeLise: I think, on the fee capture side of it, quite honestly there's a lot of variables that go into fee capture. A lot of it has to do with duration, which is interest rate driven and years to maturity. There's the trade size that impacts it and then there's participation by dealers on the all-regional plan, or the all-variable plan. And looking forward from here, I think there's a good chance that that -the $190 per million that you saw in the fourth quarter, there’s a good chance of at least maintaining that, possibly going higher. The Fed recently signaled that they are going to keep interest rates at near 0 through 2014. Look at trading on our platform, years to maturity of the last several quarters and again here in January have been in that 8.5- to 9-year range. The yield curve has flattened a little bit here, but it's been more of the short and midterm range. So we are still anticipating this longer duration or years to maturity. And even on the trade size, there's some - we had some discussions here on the trade size coming down. That did impact us as well and it favorably impacted us with our fee plan. There's a couple of breakpoints that are - the smaller the trade size, the higher the fees. So we look at these factors. And Patrick, the one you pointed out with a couple of dealers migrating down, we think, near-term, that $190 per million we think is a pretty good number near-term. And it possibly could go higher if the all-variable dealers increase their participation. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay. That's helpful. And then to kind of close the loop on the dealer environment, given that it seems like across asset classes, trading volumes have been a little bit softer. Now, you guys had a really nice run over the last few years of signing up new dealers, both major and regional. Do you kind of think that growth in your dealer base is more or less going to taper out at this point? 
Richard McVey: I think it's unlikely that we will take on new dealers at the same pace that we have over the last 3 years. There are firms increasing their commitment to credit trading virtually every quarter and we will see some of those coming in, and we will also see some dropping out as we did with MF Global during the fourth quarter. But I think, in terms of the total number of dealers’ active in the US, you should not expect to see a significant increase over the next year or 2. We think there is more to be gained from their participation and increased volume on the system across a number of different products. And I think you will see that continue over the next year or 2. And the other part is that we do believe we can do a better job with new dealer acquisition and being more flexible on fee plans in Europe. So we would like to follow the success of that dealer expansion in the US in the European region. That's one place where we hope to be able to show a larger dealer community over the next several years. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay. That segues very well into my last question before I jump back in the queue, which is, in Europe, you talked about having a 50% cost reduction for your monthly distribution fees. So is the goal behind that basically to prevent dealers from leaving because volumes are so slow? Is it to get more dealers to sign up? Is it to try to stimulate an increase in market share? I'm guessing you're going to say it's all of the above, but if you can talk through that, that would be helpful. 
Richard McVey: Yes, I think we do look at our fee structures in all products at all times to try to determine what's best for our dealer and investor clients and what's best for our shareholders. And it's clear that with the reduction in volume that we saw throughout 2011, the distribution fees were higher than they should have been. We were proactive about this, Patrick, because these are many of the same dealers that are very important to us in the rest of our product areas, in the US high-grade emerging markets, high-yield, and important to our development plans in CDS. So we wanted to address the distribution fee proactively in Europe. The key for us in that region and for our entire business is to grow volume in variable revenue. That's where our growth has come from in the largest way in the past and that's where we expect it to come from in the future. So with these changes, we think we are in the right place with dealers in Europe and we think we have a better value proposition for new dealers that we are trying to attract. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller from Sidoti & Co. 
Hugh Miller: I figured maybe I'd start off with a couple of housekeeping questions, one of which you mentioned the expected share count following the buyback, but I didn't catch when you expect that to be completed by. 
Antonio DeLise: Hugh, it’s Tony. On the buyback, we do expect the buyback to be completed over the next several months. And we’ve been active in the market since mid-December. We've got a program set up so it's running pretty much on autopilot. With that, if it's completed over the next several months and for arguments sake, let's say it's completed by the end of the first quarter, that full impact that I referenced you would see in the second quarter. 
Hugh Miller: Right. Yes, certainly. And then just a couple of other housekeepings, one of which was the reduction then from the fall-off of the 2 dealers on the US high-grade major platform, expected $1.2 million lower fixed rate fees? 
Antonio DeLise: So, Hugh, on the - what I had talked about in the prepared remarks was distribution fees compared to the fourth quarter. And the impact in there, it's really twofold. It's one month of the European distribution fee reduction and then it's the impact of these 2 US dealers migrating down. 
Hugh Miller: Okay. So if you net out the $450,000 - okay. So in other words, you just have to figure out the one-month from Euro, and then the remainder would be the change from the US high-grade. 
Antonio DeLise: That's right. And Hugh, not that I'm trying to be cute with giving forward-looking information, but just if you take it one more quarter to the second quarter, we have the full impact of Europe, we have the full impact of the US dealer migrations. We would expect the distribution fees - again, if there's no other changes in our dealer community, we would expect a further $1 million reduction in distribution fees in the second quarter. So again, compared to the fourth quarter, what I mentioned in the prepared remarks, $1.2 million reduction in Q1 and then a further $1 million reduction in Q2. And again, if nothing else changes with our dealer composition, we would expect that to continue for Q2, Q3, Q4. 
Hugh Miller: Okay. And on the European, it's a 50% reduction effective March 1. 
Antonio DeLise: Correct. 
Hugh Miller: Okay, all right. You guys also mentioned in the prepared remarks about that you are seeing the meaningful benefit for investor execution for electronic relative to telephone-based. I was wondering if you could talk to us a bit about any quantifiable numbers that you are seeing on how much of an advantage electronic is relative to telephone-based trading. 
Richard McVey: We are doing more and more work on transaction cost analysis in US high-grade in particular where we have the benefit of the TRACE tape. And you could see bid offer spreads widening out during the fourth quarter as the market conditions became more difficult. And our average cost savings within the corporate bond trades that we conducted during the quarter were around 4 basis points per trade. 
Hugh Miller: Okay. And I guess piggybacking off of the change in market conditions from the fourth quarter into what we're seeing right now in early 2012, as you think about TRACE volumes and considering that they were relatively flat in 2011, what do you see as the dynamics there as you think about the business with just industry volumes aside from your ability to take market share? 
Richard McVey: Obviously, a lot of factors will go into the TRACE volume for 2012, many of which we can't possibly predict today. Having said that, this continues to be an environment where investors need yield. Government bond yields, especially in the US, are extremely low, and we are seeing inflows of investors moving into credit and we are seeing them invest at the longer end of the curve where they can find more yield. I think the one mitigating factor to TRACE volumes during the second half of the year were the significant concerns coming out of Europe. And at least temporarily, there is a much more meaningful funding solution coming out of the ECB that's led to a significant rally in credit spreads in the European region that's having a ripple effect into the US. So the combination of the search for yield and the increased confidence in credit and the European solution is driving significant growth in trading volumes versus where we were in the second half of last year. So right now obviously this is a very favorable environment, and we would expect that the increase that we've seen in corporate bond debt over the last 3 years does give rise to more turnover in a normal credit trading environment. So we remain hopeful and optimistic that TRACE volumes will be active throughout the year. 
Hugh Miller: Okay, appreciate the insight there. And I guess, if you take a look at the slides, you do see obviously the hit rate in the fourth quarter was a bit lower than the third quarter. I know there was a particular softness in October, but was wondering if you could just provide us some color there on how the hit rate was at the end of the year in December, and any trends there that we are seeing into early '12. 
Richard McVey: I don't know that we've got the monthly numbers on the hit rate in front of us this morning, but it definitely was related to the environment. We have seen an uptick, as I mentioned earlier, in hit rates during the month of January. But we are not yet back to what we would consider a very healthy hit rate environment, which is where you see the MarketAxess hit rate tend to be somewhere around 75%. We are not back up to that level just yet. 
Hugh Miller: Right. Okay. And the last question I had was, when you think about the incremental operating margin now about 80%, up from about closer to 65% historically. Even with some of the investments you've made kind of in preparation for CDS, when I think about it, I would suspect that's just the shift in dealer participation mix, and then also obviously you guys have made some adjustments on the comp accruals. But are there any other factors? And if not, what's really driving that? Is there one driving it more than the other? 
Antonio DeLise: Hugh, on the incremental margins and maybe be more specifically on what the expectations are going forward, we were at 80% in 2011. There were some items driving that. I think we are more comfortable talking about what's happened over the last 5 or 6 years and that's been more in the 65% to 70% range. As I mentioned before, even when you look at our expenses going forward, the expense increase mainly comes from the compensation and benefits line, and that is controllable in large part. So I think we continue to target these incremental margins in that 65% to 70% range. If we can grow that top line revenue number, it's going to drive our overall margins higher. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander from KBW. 
Niamh Alexander: [indiscernible] I just wanted to touch on, firstly, the dividend, because you had indicated that you would deploy your excess cash for buybacks and dividends and you hiked the dividend. But I guess I thought your longer-term target yield was closer to 2%. So am I correct in thinking about that you're holding a little bit back here? Are you starting to see some acquisition opportunities? Help me understand that. 
Antonio DeLise: Niamh, on the dividend, maybe I'll let Rick talk about the acquisition side of things. But on the dividend itself, we did have some initial targets there that we had expressed, which was that 2% to 2.25% yield and paying out around a third of our free cash flow. Share price quite frankly has taken care of that first item. Prior to making this - to adopting the increase here in the dividend, we are down around 1.2%.We got up to about 1.5% yield. I think more important than that, when the Board, when we are looking at dividends, this is our second consecutive annual increase. I think the more important thing to look at is what we are paying out in terms of either free cash flow or EPS now is around 30%, so it's pretty close to that target that we set up. And even looking at the combination now of the buyback and the dividends, we're going to pay out around 85% of free cash flow generation in the combination of those 2 items. It's - so I'd say that those initial targets are not hard and fast targets, but probably the more compelling item was around our payout ratio and again targeting that one-third payout ratio. 
Niamh Alexander: Okay, that makes sense. I guess on the acquisitions, I felt over the last few months maybe you've been signaling that maybe you are starting to see some opportunities. I thought maybe retail came up. Could you give us an update on that, Rick? 
Richard McVey: Not really, nothing new to report, Niamh. But I think that the key message is that we continue to be very enthusiastic about the organic growth opportunities and confident in our capabilities to execute on those opportunities. So the Company's primary focus is on organic growth. No change. We do look at things and if we can find complementary acquisitions, we would be interested, but our primary focus is on organic growth. But as it relates to the dividend and our balance sheet, we do like a strong balance sheet for a whole host of reasons. And one of them is based on our ability to be opportunistic if the right acquisition does come along. 
Niamh Alexander: Okay, fair enough, Rick. And can I get an update on what are you doing now with respect to clearing CDS? Because you are actually clearing some of the credit default swaps and I think realistically we probably shouldn't be modeling any revenue or net contribution to earnings, shall we say, from this kind of nascent product for another year or so. Is that fair, but can you just give us an update on what's actually happening? 
Richard McVey: Yes, happy to. Actually, the fourth quarter, in terms of product development, was a very productive quarter for us. We have about 9 dealers streaming executable CDS index levels through MarketAxess now. We have been able to develop some new trading protocols around not just RQ, but streaming quotes and request for markets. We are getting clients to start trying the new functionality that we have available on the CDS system and we are working very hard on post-trade connectivity, and we have established most of the links that we need to the clearinghouses and the affirmation hub. So a lot of work has gone into it and a lot of work has gone into preparing to register and apply to be a SEF. With respect to trading volumes, it's still a small part of what we are doing. There's more activity over the last quarter, more clients and dealers participating, but it's still a very small part of what we are doing. And I think that there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the regulatory outcome and what the final rules will look like. And I think that the CDS market is looking for more clarity before really starting to change their trading behavior in a larger way. 
Niamh Alexander: That's helpful, Rick. Just given the regulatory kind of hold-up as it were, everyone is and clearly you are going ahead and making the investments and getting the connectivity to the clients. But is it more realistic just to expect this to potentially get more incrementally additive to the earnings, so 2013 at the earliest? 
Richard McVey: It's been a moving target and it's hard to say. I think, Niamh, it's exactly what I said in my prepared comments, that the CFTC has bucketed the SEF rules in the April and beyond category. We hear anecdotally that they have SEF rules in mind for the early part of that window, which would hopefully be this spring, but the market will need time before fully implementing those rules. And they have consistently talked about 180 days from rules being finalized to implementation dates. So I think, with respect to the big catalyst and the regulatory changes, yes, it would appear to us now that the best guess is that those rules will be implemented sometime around the end of this year. 
Niamh Alexander: Okay. Fair enough, Rick, I appreciate the answer there. Just on the other one, the $1 million question, the market share gains, it was a very consistent performance last year in terms of the market share growth on top of the prior year as well. Where are the opportunities? Where are the biggest opportunities to continue growing the market share at that pace? Are there maybe some potential big customers that you could bring on board? Is it deeper penetration of existing customers, or is it also the market structure shift in that just more of the dealers doing the smaller trades away - over the phone? 
Richard McVey: Yes, I think it's all of the above, really. We are working very hard as always on promoting the benefits of electronic trading on MarketAxess to investors and dealers. On the investors’ side, I think the transaction cost analysis and the price improvement is making a big difference in the way they think about order flow coming into the MarketAxess system. We do still have some very large clients that do very little electronic trading. They are all on MarketAxess, but they are doing far less than their peers on average, so we are redoubling our efforts with them to get them to embrace the system more significantly. We also are using the TCA work to prove that price benefit applies not only to small trades but to larger trades as well to get investors more comfortable with moving their trade sizes up. Some of them sit in very small trade sizes electronically and are not even pushing the $5 million and under boundaries yet. So we think there's more we can do on moving the trade size up. And I think you should expect us to continue to be ambitious about expanding trading conductivity on the platform. These changes will continue to create new trading desks and new dealers and there's a lot of interest in using electronic trading to connect with more and more counter-parties and you should expect that to be part of our strategy going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Wong from Morningstar. 
Michael Wong: Can you remind me if your planned OTC derivatives SEF platform will be more vertically focused buy side to sell side versus let's say sell side to sell side, and if your current buy side customer base are already large users of credit default swaps? 
Richard McVey: Yes, 2 good questions. Our primary focus continues to be the institutional customer to multi-dealer space and that is our focus in CDS, just like it is in bonds. I think it's quite possible that, over time, on the back of central clearing and more electronic trading, when you look at the most liquid swap contracts like the CDS indices, that there may be some blurring of those lines between the client-to-dealer and dealer-to-dealer space. But our primary focus is client-to-dealer and we think that market segmentation for the most part will remain in CDS much the way that it is today. 
Michael Wong: Okay. In terms of your traditional US high-grade customer base behavior, besides extending the duration of the bonds they trade of US high-grade, have they also been contributing more towards your other products such as emerging market debt? 
Antonio DeLise: Michael, it's Tony. Yes they have and I don't have the statistics in front of me on the number of products traded by clients. I apologize for that. But yes, that is the case. Even when we look across each one of our products, we have more clients trading across each individual product quarter-over-quarter. And again I don't have those particular statistics in front of me, but that increase in client participation across each individual product is coming from our existing client base. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow up question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: A couple more follow-ups for you. The first is on your Other product group. Pricing was down a little bit sequentially in the fourth quarter. I apologize if you already spoke about that, but I assume that was just a function of product mix where you did more agencies and less relative in high-yield and emerging markets. And assuming that's the case, I was curious what your expectations are for 2012. 
Richard McVey: Sure, Patrick. You're right. That decline in fee capture really mix-driven and it doesn’t revolve around agencies and a little bit of CDS and I'll tell you one thing. Prospectively, I think we're going to give you a little more information, particularly on CDS or at least breaking out credit derivatives from the credit bonds that are traded, so that we take out some of that noise around fee capture. So when we plan on releasing volumes in all likelihood tomorrow, at that point in time we'll try and give a little more clarity on what's going on around CDS. But in terms of that decline, Q3 to Q4, mix-driven, the fee capture across the individual products, whether it was agencies, emerging markets, high-yield, individually did not change, but some change in the mix there. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay. And then 2012, I think it sounds like you are trying to place some emphasis on growing your emerging markets and high-yield business. Do you think you're going to get much traction to the extent that we should see your fee capture maybe pick up a little bit? 
Richard McVey: We were really pleased, Patrick, with the growth across all 3 of those categories in 2011 and the trend seems to be in place that investors and dealers are doing more electronic trading across all credit products. So we would remain optimistic that there are growth opportunities in 2012 for all of those product areas. Having said that, the absolute level of volume is highest currently in agencies and as you know, that is where we have a lower fee capture due to lower bid offer spreads in the agency market. So I think that's something to watch that growth rates could be the same, but we would still be accumulating more volume in that category in the agency product. But certainly in the kind of environment that we've had in January, we are very optimistic about the electronic trading appetite for high-yield and EM as well. 
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Okay, fair enough. And then lastly, I want to touch on your dealer-to-dealer initiatives. I know you touched on it a little bit in past calls. Just wanted to get an update on where you stand as far as dealer-to-dealer. How big of a priority is that for you and with trade sizes maybe ticking down a little bit, does that make it maybe more - provide a little bit easier entree into the dealer-to-dealer space? 
Richard McVey: It does. I don't think you should think of us in the dealer-to-dealer space as a primary competitor of the large inter-dealer brokers. We are trying to help our dealer clients address the balance sheet issues that they are currently facing. And there is a lot of demand to move $3 million in underline items off balance sheets more quickly than they have in the past. It really wasn't a priority 3 years ago for dealers to move those bonds off their balance sheet. If they could sell them, great. If not, they were happy to manage that risk and earn carry on those line items. The environment is very different now and they don't want to clutter their balance sheet with lots of small ticket line items in corporate bonds. And with about 55 or 60 dealers participating in high-grade and even more in our D-to-D initiative, allowing dealers to send lists and inquiries to each other so that those bonds can more quickly find a natural home and reduce overall balance sheets, is a service that we think fits these times very well with our dealers. We are seeing increased take-up, and we are, at their request, making some technology changes to be able to do more of that more efficiently. So we do think it's a new opportunity. It's a small piece of what we are doing today, but we think it's another sign that electronic connectivity can help dealers with the balance sheet constraints that they are currently confronting. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Rick McVey for closing remarks. 
Richard McVey: Thanks very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-10-27 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Dave Cresci - IR Manager Rick McVey - Chairman and CEO Kelly Millet - President Tony DeLise - CFO
Analysts:  Hugh Miller - Sidoti and Company Howard Chen - Credit Suisse Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, October 27th, 2010. I would now like to turn your call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Cresci: Good morning. And welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2010 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review highlights for the quarter, Kelly Millet, President, will provide an update on trends in our businesses and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. I'd also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2010 results. This morning we reported another set of stronger quarterly results. Our record revenues and earnings reflect strong momentum at our core e-trading product areas, continued strength in investor order flow and disciplined expense management. Operating margin improved to 36% during the third quarter, a significant increase from 28.5% one year ago. EPS of $0.22 was almost double year ago levels. Variable transaction fees were the largest contributor to revenue growth and were up 29% driven by a combination of volume and fee per million growths. Fee capture per million increased during the quarter, reflecting additional contributions from our regional dealer fee plan and stronger emerging market and high yield bond volume. Total trading volume of $105 billion was 25% above a year-ago and the highest since pre-credit crisis levels in the second quarter of 2007. Industrial order flow in to the system was up 8% and 16% in US high grade. Increased investor order flow and improved dealer hit rates combined, increased our estimated US high grade market share to 8.3% versus 6.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Slide 4 displays the details on our financial strength. For the third quarter EBITDA grew to $15 million and our EBITDA margin reached 40% up from 34% one year ago. Free cash flow of more $50 million in the last 12 months has provided the financial flexibility to comfortably execute our share repurchase program and meet our quarterly cash dividend. During the quarter we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $23 million. We expect the repurchase program to conclude in the fourth quarter, which will meet the objective to offset the increase of our diluted share count, which occurred from 2009 to mid 2010. Our cash and securities balance at September month end was $183 million compared to $188 million at the end of June. During the third quarter we expended a total of $26 million on the share repurchase program and the quarterly dividend. We largely covered the entire capital management related expenditures with cash flow generated during the current period. Our Board will continue to consider capital management opportunities for our share holders on our regular basis. Slide 5 provides an update on regulatory reform in our credit to flows swap platform. We are encouraged by the pace of activity in the rule-writing process, by both of the key regulators the CFTC and the SEC. We believe the regulators are on track to finalize the new rules for OTC derivatives markets by the target date next July. The first rules on conflicts of interest have already been released and we expect further clarification on swap execution facility principles within the next few months. We believe that our transparent trading protocols and our independent governance model will meet the principles for a swap execution facility. We would expect the new rules for trading and clearing, standardized swaps to be in effect 60 to 90 days after the rules are finalized. We don’t know yet how broad the universe of clearable swaps will be, but we continue to expect to run 80% of the CDS market will eventually be centrally cleared, which will trigger the requirement for execution on an exchange for a swap execution facility. Bond within the CDS market was down from pre-crisis levels is still substantially greater than volumes in the cash credit bond markets. A good portion of the CDS volume takes place in highly liquid indices and we believe the client-to-dealer volume represents about 35 to 40% of the CDS total. Key questions remain on whether the rules will provide exemptions from the execution requirements for block trades and the number of viable entities that could become [SAS]. We are actively engaged in the process with both regulators and market participants and we believe that our credit trading connectivity and trading technology creates valuable competitive advantages. Now, let me turn the call over to Kelly, for more detail regarding our third quarter business results.
Kelley Millet: Thank you, Rick. Slide six, provides an update on market conditions. During the third quarter credit market conditions remained healthy. High grade credit spread is measured by the credit suite LUCY index ended the quarter at 136 basis points over treasury, a decrease from 158 basis points at the end of the second quarter and credit spread volatility was 4.3% at the end of September, down from 6.5% at June month end. During the third quarter non-government guarantee new issue volume increased to $208 billion, the highest it has been since the second quarter of 2008. The yield curve flattened relative to the second quarter, but remained steep on a historical basis. Taxable bonds, funds and ETS continue to see strong inflows creating additional demand for corporate bonds and other credit assets. Slide 7 highlights our improved client and dealer participation. The decline in primary dealer corporate holdings from pre-crisis levels highlights the importance of the increasing participation of non-primary dealers. During the third quarter new dealers added to the platform since the second quarter of 2008 accounted for 15% of the volume and 23% of the trade count. As a result of the increased participation of new dealers and better performance from existing dealers, hit rates have shown a strong improvement. High grade hit rates were 74% for the third quarter compared to 66% in the third quarter of 2009 and 70% during the previous quarter. The increase in US high grade market share for the third quarter and year-to-date demonstrates the contribution of both improved investor [increased wealth] and dealer hit rate. The continued self focus on late adapters, transaction cost analysis, connectivity and technology enhancements can drive additional share gain. Slide 8, summarizes the trading volumes across our product categories. Overall growth of volume is up 25% year-over-year to $100.5 billion. The last time quarterly volumes reached this level was in the second quarter of 2007 when 18% of total volume was attributable to floating rate note trade. Record quarterly volumes were reached for US fixed rate, emerging markets, and agency bonds. In US high grade our estimated market share for the third quarter improved to 88.3% as [volumes] rose to 60 billion up 28% year-over-year and up 4% from the second quarter. Eurobond volumes declined 35% from the third quarter of last year and 16% from the second quarter 2010. Europe continues to face a challenging market environment due principally to sovereign debt concerns. The launch of the click-to-trade protocol gives us access to a larger addressable market. We are also increasing sales resources aimed at addressing underperforming clients and regions, which can support future volume growth. The other product category volumes increased to 29.4 million, up 75% from the third quarter of 2009 and 7% from the second quarter of 2010. The increase was driven primarily by another quarter of strong growth in emerging market volumes. Slide 9 highlights the revenue drivers of the business. US high-grade TRACE volumes remain strong driven by number of factors that I spoke to you earlier. US high-grade TRACE volumes are paced to reach the highest annual level since 2003. Product variable fee per million of $188 increased $13 from the second quarter of 2010 and were up $6 from the third quarter a year ago. Dealers on the high grade regional fee plan and higher emerging market volumes were the main contributors to the higher fee capture. Total variable transaction fees of $18.9 million accounted for 60% of the total commission. A portion of the variable transaction fee growth is attributable to the incremental execution fees generated by the regional plan dealers. Given the continued success of the dealers on the regional fee plan, we do except several of them to migrate to the major dealer fee plan. With that let me turn the call to Tony for more details regarding our third quarter financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you, Kelly. Please turn to slide 10 for our earnings performance. Our record revenue of $37 million increased 25% from a year-ago, primarily driven by commission revenue growth and continued positive contributions from our technology products and services group. Third quarter revenue has also included a one-time gain of approximately $400,000 on the sale of a treasury note. Total expenses were $23.9 million, up 2% sequentially and 11% in the third quarter of 2009. The revenue growth and expense management, led to record pretax income of $13.5 million, up 58% from last year. Incremental margin year-over-year was 64%. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 36.3% and reflects favorable adjustments, principally resulting form the filing of our 2009 tax returns during the period. We expect our full year tax rate to be towards the lower end of the guidance range of 39% to 41%. The share repurchase plan activity reduced third quarter diluted share count by approximately 900,000 shares. As Rick mentioned we expect to complete repurchases under the $30 million plan in the fourth quarter, at which time we will have bought back a projected total of approximately 1.9 million shares. Assuming an average share price around last night’s close of $18.31 we would expect our diluted share count for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 38.2 million to 38.6 million shares. On slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Distribution fees of $12.3 million were up $1.6 million from the third quarter of 2009 due principally to the addition of several major dealers over the past year. We project that distribution fees will increase by approximately $800,000 in the fourth quarter. The US represents the majority of this increase as several dealers participating in the regional plan migrate to the major plan. At third quarter volume, duration and average trade size levels, the migration is revenue neutral. All else equal the increase in distribution fees would be offset by a corresponding decline in variable transaction fees resulting in a reduction in US high grade transaction fee per million of approximately $13 to $15. The Euro bond fee capture reflects the fee plan change made late in second quarter of 2010. The other product category fee capture increased to $189 per million for the third quarter compared to $166 for the second quarter. Fee capture in the other product category is driven principally by the mix of volume in high yield emerging markets and agency bonds. Compared to the second quarter emerging market bond represented a higher percentage of volume in this category. Slide 12 provides you the with expense detail. Total expenses for the third quarter were up 2% from the second quarter and in line with the first half of the year run rate. Employee headcount was little changed during the quarter. We do expect to additional sales and technology resources in the fourth quarter and believe that we are tracking towards the higher end of the full year 2010 expense guidance range of $94 million to $96 million. We anticipate that there will be incremental expenses beginning in 2011 associated with running a swap execution facility. The incremental expenses, mainly personal related, would ramp up in the second half of the year. We currently expect that staff related headcount could result in a 3% to 5% increase in total headcount by year end 2011. Consistent with our past practice we will provide full year of 2011 expense guidance in conjunction with our year end earnings call. On slide 13 we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash equivalent and securities as of September 30 were $183 million or $4.72 per diluted share compared to $174 million at year end 2009 and $162 million one year ago. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $51 million including a deferred income tax benefit of $16 million. With the recent earnings performance we are quickly utilizing our US federal tax loss carried forward. At the current level of earnings, we will have some tax loss and credit carry forward available for use next year but we expect to be in a federal tax paying position during 2011. Total stockholders equity including the Series B preferred stock was $256 million as of September 30, representing book value on a diluted basis of $6.61 per share. We continued to have no bank debt. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Tony. Our strategy to expand our trading network and our great product capabilities is paying off with record revenues earnings and cash flow. Consistent revenue growth is driving earnings momentum and improved margins. In addition to the significant growth potential in existing products, we’re excited about the new opportunities emerging in the OTC derivatives space. We are actively investing the benefit from the regulatory changes. We believe the addressable market opportunity for electronic trading in fixed income markets is getting larger. While at the same time our competitive position is getting stronger. I would now like to open the call for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Hugh Miller of Sidoti and Company.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti and Company: You guys have mentioned a little bit about some of the swap execution facility cost you had expected to incur in the second half of ‘11. I was wondering should we be thinking about the possibility of some revenue enhancement from that trading, to kind of offset a portion of the cost or is that on a [likely] scenario?
Rick McVey: I think, Hugh we would anticipate that the additional cost for operating a swap would hit in the second half of the year at the same time that the new trading requirements would also kick in. So yes, we would expect expenses to revenue and revenues both to start emerging during the second half of the next year.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti and Company: Okay. So is they are likely to kind of be more of a wash? Would you say at this point obviously no one has a crystal ball where you know or one kind of outweighing the other?
Rick McVey: Yes. It’s really difficult to say right now.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti and Company: Okay. And how are you seeing the competitive landscape shaping up for the number of clients-to-dealer SAS and how do you expect kind of competition to emerge from that category?
Rick McVey Tony DeLise:  Depending on the speaker, we have heard estimates at anywhere from 30 SAS to as high as 8o to 100. So, nobody really knows but it’s across all asset classes and across all client segments. And as you are aware there are very few networks that are positioned to easily accommodate a swap execution in the institutional customer to multi-dealers phase. And we were pleased with the developments that we saw during the quarter. The conflict of interest rules clearly favored independent governance structures. We think we are in great shape there. There has been commentary that it’s unlikely that single dealer systems would qualify at SAS. So, we think the viable entities active in the institutional customer in the multi-dealers phase or CDS are fairly limited.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti and Company: Okay. Do you have a sense or any sense I guess on where you would anticipate variable fee per million of pricing would kind of workout for index single name or is it something that you don’t have a great handle on to share at this time?
Rick McVey: We really don’t have a great handle on it to share at the time. I think we’ve said consistently that a little over half of the CDS volume is taking place in a highly liquid indices, with varied site that offers spreads. And you would expect the transaction fees for those indices to be significantly lower than higher bid offer markets like corporate bonds. So, the indices fees we would expect to be consistent with liquid product fees and I think single name fees depend on liquidity of the name, but we would currently expect it to fall somewhere between the index fee and the corporate bond fee.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti and Company: Got it. Okay. You mentioned in the slides about the split between dealer-to-dealer and client-to-dealer and obviously, the client-to-dealer would be more in line with what you currently do. Is there a possibility that you guys could be able to pickup business in dealer-to-dealer or is that really not an addressable market for you?
Rick McVey: Yeah. I think we have those capabilities and we will continue to consider all opportunities in E-trading in a variety of different client segments. Our strength is clearly in the client-to-multi-dealer segment and that is our primary focus to start out. And, we really don’t know how the trading models will evolve either but it’s quite possible that liquid markets like indices will start to evolve into a more open trading protocol.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti and Company: Okay. And question just with regards to obviously, we have seen an improvement in the hit rate now reaching towards 74%, a nice pick up for the last quarter. Is it realistic to think that the hit rates could kind of trend up over 75% or they are kind of, I know from a historical stand point, I don’t think its kind of done that but what are the trends you are seeing there? How strong could the hit rate potentially get to in your opinion?
Kelly Millet: Hugh, its Kelly I think on a historical basis again drilling down to the hybrid business I think our high-tech in terms of hit rates were more in this sort of high 70s to 80. I think a couple of variables will affect our ability to continue to improve on that. Obsessively it’s the continued growth and importance of our regional dealers and that’s both regional dealers that migrated as Tony said up to the major plan as well as back-selling new regional dealers into that group and the continued focus and work with existing major dealers. A lot of that is day-to-day work around rallying and credit with our dealer customers but there is also a lot of work going on associated with automating their capability to interact, whether its delivering inventory of the API at a more regular, more high quality basis, whether that instituting trading APIs, so that they can interact not necessarily just [aggregate] within their own system, as well as what you have number of them to provide software and tools that they can aggregate prices across markets and execute either more efficiently or in fact on an auto execute basis in the smaller ticket sizes. So I think they are subject to caveat of market conditions, volatility, risk appetite. I do think there is upside based on the initiatives that are laid out there.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti and Company: Okay, great color there. And just a last question with regards to market share trends for US high grade that you could potentially share with us regards to what you are seeing so far in October?
Kelly Millet: Yeah, I know its interesting, look I spoke a lot about that for the last couple of days I mean market share can vary as you know day-to-day, week-to-week and even month-to-month. And it’s impacted by a number of factors including risk appetites. It’s impacted by the overall level of new issue activity. And can even be about which clients are busy in a given day week or month.  What I would try to do with the Rick’s leadership and with the team is try to focus on a sustainable improvement in share. And I try to look at that on quarterly basis and if you look at on quarterly share gains in high grade go from 79 to 81 and now to 83 in the last quarter. So that’s sort of my marker of US, sort of saying that’s sort of what might drive. So we feel comfortable that we can continue to drive share higher on that sort of measurement basis quarter-to-quarter and there can be month-to-month fluctuation that to some degree quite frankly are out of our control.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Howard Chen of Credit Suisse.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Kelly I just have another spin on the previous question. I guess it’s around US high grade business. What do you think we should be looking at to gauge the possibility to just make further market share gains so that 8.3%, is it a hit rate increased volume and what should we be looking out that’s out there to see that expanded to the double-digits and beyond.
Kelly Millet: Well if you look at slide 7, to lower rate quadrant. It really was a contribution from both elements of the classes right hit rate, it was a function of improving [in play], as well as improving hit rate so on the increase side we work in two rates we have the late adaptors those that we, those that we think are in a sense of punching below their weight and should be doing more business over the platform. We do that with new and more senior sales people. We do that in delivering transaction cost analysis, best execution analysis, which is a very compelling argument in the US market place. And then as I said on the dealer side, in addition to gathering more dealers who are pushing dealers up to the major plan, its working with their traders from a technology standpoint from very fundamental issues of routing and how they filter their pop up to their ability to more automatically and efficiently responding to. And there is gradation or rather they just either you are contributing or receiving levels through API all the way to their ability to [stake] from various sources in order population, to order to execute the increase. So, there are lot of efforts going on both the supply side and the sell side, on a consistent basis. And really it’s that combination of the two that we think on a quarterly basis and push it to grind that share higher. Regarding the caveat it also is though to be subject to market conditions as you know volatility as well as risk appetite. So, there are really a few sort of parallel facts that we take with both supply side and the sell side on an aggressive basis.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Thanks, Kelly. And shifting gears to the regional dealers moving fees schedules just post the $800,000 revenue neutral shift that we see in the fourth quarter that Tony spoke to you, where are we after that and how much is there left to go?
Tony DeLise: Howard, this is Tony. On the regional deals, we had a slide in there. On slide 9, we actually broke out the variable transaction fee to give you a sense of the execution fees, the additional fees generated by the regional plan. So, if you look at the slide, you would have seen that healthy growth, a 100% growth year-over-year in the execution fees. You said about to $3 million level in Q3. While, a chunk of that will shift over to fixed distribution fees, I think the positive thing we’re seeing is that there is another group of regional dealers who if you look at their performance months-over-months and quarter-over-quarter are increasing their participation. So, the guidance we gave assumes that, there is no further improvement in contributions from the regional dealer. I think the reality is, what history is showing that those regional dealers are participating, representing a bigger portion of trade content, trade volumes. So, I think we’ve given some guidance there on a revenue neutral, volume neutral basis but again there are some up and coming regionals that are increasing their participation.
Rick McVey: Another way to think, in other way to think about that is, as you look at the chart around corporate holdings amongst the co-primary dealers, although that stabilized, that is no we’re near back as you’re aware to pre-crisis levels. So, we generally continue to believe there is an opportunity, not only to migrate successful regional dealers to the major fee plan, which gives us that distribution fee, gives us a greater degree of certainty around that revenue flow. But we’ve actually have been pleasantly surprised that we’ve been continuing to add dealers in a sense, into the regional dealer pipeline and these are not necessary all small firms but rather firms who or either international or have recommitted to the cash markets. So, Tony’s numbers are like apples-to-apples, all are equal basis being revenue, neutral. My job, my team’s job is to ensure that we continue to in a sense grow that regional pie and continue to have that growth in their participation. I would point out that the most relevant nature of that participation is just the amount of tickets that in fact that group were doing and we think that is very important because we continue to think there is a large portion of that addressable market in that sort of odd market three million [bucket] size that these guys truly can help us to capture. So I think it’s the right statement to make financially because the job at hand is to continue in a sense to replenish that regional group, so that we don’t in a sense see that complete degradation in fees per million that Tony referenced.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Great thanks and then just to complete that thought, Kelly. So how many regional dealers do you have now and what do you see at the universe? And how many are switching over to the major plan, I don’t know how much of that you’ve disclosed?
Kelly Millet: We don’t give a tremendous amount of details on that but just sort of in a rough terms right now participating on the major plan we have around 25 dealers that participating in regional plan there is around 25 dealers, it’s also around 50 in total. We will with the numbers I gave you there is definitely two regionals that will move up to the major plan, one did in the third quarter, one in the fourth quarter. We probably have two or three other regionals in the course of the next three or four, five months have a very good chance of moving up. In terms of bringing new dealers on, there is some fluid movement in some of the smaller regional that we bring on. I think as far as we bring the regional on they can go one of three ways, they can outperform or move up to the major plan, they can speak with the regional plan and pay the execution fee and in some cases, quite frankly they don’t perform and they fall off of the platform. So there is still a handful that will come on this quarter and its likely there is something handful that are going to fall off as well.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks for that detail. And just a quick one on the numbers, investment income and other revenues stepped up nicely from the second quarter. Could you just help to lay out any drivers there or unique items?
Tony DeLise: Sure. Howard, this is Tony again. There is really, and just to be honest there is one number that sticks out in that other. I did reference, that we had at sale of a treasury note in the third quarter, we simply extended the maturity on a portion of our Treasury note investments because the rates have going down and prices are going up, we were sitting on an unrealized gain at that point in time. Think of it as a onetime event, it’s not something we are doing in a normal course and that’s really drove the increase in that other revenue category.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James Financial Inc.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: Can you provide a little bit more color on the traction that you’ve got with the click-to-trade platform over in Europe? Certainly I think you guys got it towards fee capture over there falling to about $100, it sold at 93 for the quarter. So it’s little bit more than what you have expected. Is that because may be you got more pickup into the trading months that you were thinking or I guess what accounts for the variance there and just overall what sort of client reaction are you getting to the product?
Tony DeLise: Yes, just a moment on the fee capture, when we introduced the click-to-trade protocol and it is beta phase, we also recognized we had to understand what fee model we would put in place across both the RFQ business and the click-to-trade. So, we moved for all products. Except for government products, we’ll see over $100 per million. So, any variance around that $100 a million will be a function of what the participation of our contribution of government bond trading is in the total amount. So, that’s really the fee plan discussion. In terms of where we stand, we have approximately, a dozen dealers who are now contributing live market into the click-to-trade protocol. We don’t give a lot of specific details but we’re very pleased with the growth number of line items as well as the gross number of line items where we are seeing a minimum of pool prices. We purposely launched this on our database to a fairly narrow select group of customers in order to get a feedback on most field functionality and the rest. We will be launching it out of this on beta phase to very narrow select group of customers to order to garner feedback of multi-deal functionality in US. We will launching it out of this beta phase in approximately the middle of November, opening up to all of our European buy side customers. So, we feel that with critical mass on the dealers and that work is ongoing coupled with now opening up the products to the full universe to European customers, I think we’ll really begin to get a good hand on in an enchanting mark-to-market about the competitive success of that alternative protocol. We do feel it has been very well received. The feedback from the typical traders that use RFQ love it because it provides instantaneous price discovery, and points to who are the dealer that they should chose within the arc real quick. So, still a lot of work to do, but should have a lot of more detail in fact to discus at the end of the fourth quarter.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James: Understood. Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then, kind of, on a summer vein, over here in the US regarding the falls loss. Certainly, I think in Washington there is been a lot of discussion around, whether the RFQ protocol is appropriate for kind of all swaps or whether it should be more of a live streaming code type system. What is your latest take on that? And how do you think that you guys are positioned if it does go to click-to-trade type protocol?
Tony DeLise: I think it’s a great question, Patrick. I think, the regulatory objective is to ensure that the OTC derivative market has both pre-trade and post-trade transparency. And I think that the appropriate questions are being asked about whether the RFQ model offers the appropriate level of pre-trade transparency. We’ve had many meetings with the regulators, many discussions, we’ve been part of the round table panel that they’ve had in Washington. And our current read is that they are getting increasingly comfortable with the pre and post trade transparency of our RFQ model. So it’s possible I think that there would be required, we would be required to make a few tweaks to what we do today. But we think they’re pretty straight forward in terms of the technology work. And quite frankly, with the number of trading protocols that we already have built in the system, we think we’re ready today for virtually any outcome.
Operator: If there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for his closing remark.
Rick McVey: Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2010 Q2  (2010-07-28 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Dave Gretzky - Investor Relations Manger Rick McVey - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kelly Millet - President Tony DeLise - Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts: Hugh Miller – Sidoti Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill Howard Chen – Credit Suisse Michael Wong – Morningstar
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a remainder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, July the 28, 2010. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Gretzky, Investor Relations Manger at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Gretzky: Good morning. And welcome to the MarketAxess second quarter 2010 conference call. On the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review highlights for the quarter, Kelly Millet, President, will provide an update on trends in our businesses and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. I'd also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2010 results. We are pleased to report another set of strong quarterly results with record revenues of $35.3 million of 37% from a year-ago. And a record pre-tax income of $11.9 million, 107% above second quarter of 2009. The strong revenue growth combined with operating leverage lead to a marked improvement in operating margins to approximately 34%. EPS of $0.18 was more than double year-ago levels. Variable transaction fees were the largest contributor to revenue growth and were up 53% driven by a combination of volume and fee per million growths. Fee capture remained strong reflecting additional contributions from our regional dealer fee plant. Total trading volume of $98 million was 47% above a year-ago. Investor order fall in to this system was up 30% and we now have 80 market making dealers up from 60 one year ago. Slide 4 displays the details on our financial strength. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30th 2010. EBITDA and free cash flow were both approximately $50 million in each case more than double the levels from one year ago. Trailing 12 months operating margin expanding to 32%. Our cash and securities balance at June month end was $188 billion or $4.75 per diluted shares. When assessing alternatives for deploying our capital we have four priorities. Our first priority is to grow the business by investing in both existing products and new product opportunities such as CDS. We continue to evaluate additive acquisitions in the e-trading market data or trading technologies states. We are returning capital through our shareholders through our regular quarterly cash dividend. The Board is approved our fourth quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share. Finally, we recently announced the $30 million share repurchase program. The buyback was principally established to offset the increase in our diluted share accounts. The repurchase program started in July and it expected to be accretive. Slide five provides an update on the current regulatory reform in our credit to flows swap platform. On July, 21, the financial regulatory reform bill was signed which contains two important mandates regarding electronic trading of OTC derivatives. First, standardized swaps must be cleared by an approved clearing organization. And second, Clearable swaps must be traded on an exchange or swap execution facility. We believe that in regulations will create a stronger and sounder OTC derivatives market. The ultimate result is likely to be a larger OTC swap market with a broader set of industry participants. We intended to register and operate as a swap execution facility which will be regulated by the SEC and CFTC. Although the room making process is expected to take approximately 12 to 18 months we are preparing now for transition to e-trading for standardized swaps. Based on data published by the DTC [ph] Trade ware house, we estimate that the total average daily trading volume in the client to deal our CDS market is approximately 50 to $60 billion including index and single main swaps. We currently expect the e-trading mandate to apply to 50 to 75% of the daily CDS volume. We believe our improving credit trading technology and our large institutional credit-trading network are valuable assets in the CDS space. We are focused on this opportunity. Now, let me turn the call over to Kelly for more detail regarding our second quarter business results.
Kelly Millet: Thank you, Rich. Slide six provides an update on market conditions. Through the second quarter credit market conditions weaken slightly demonstrated by an increase in credit spreads and credit spread volatility along with softer new issuance volume. High-grade credit spread as measured by the Credit Suisse Lucy Index end of the quarter at 158 basis points above treasury, an increase from 118 basis points at the end of the first quarter. And credit spread volatility with 6.5% at June on '10 up from 3.8% at the end of March. Non-government guaranteed new issuance declined to 106 billion during the second quarter to the level since the fourth quarter of 2008. Taxable bond and corporate bond EPS inflows remain positive but have slowed. Slide seven summarizes the trading volume across our product categories. Overall, global volume was up 47% year-over-year in 98.3 billion. Despite more challenging market conditions during the second quarter where U.S. high grade head rates were down slightly, but in line with fourth quarter 2009 level. Market share grew to 8.1%. Year gone buyings declined 3% from the second quarter of 2009 and 20% from the first quarter of 2010. Europe continues to face a challenging market environment to principally due to sovereign debt concerns. We have seen a rapid increase in volatility and spread as measured by the Credit Suisse Liquid Eurobond index, and retail bonds outflows in the region. The other product category volumes increased to 27.4 billion, up 74% from the second quarter of 2009, and 26% from the first quarter of this year. The increase was driven by another quarter of strong growth in agencies and emerging market volumes. Slightly highlight the revenue drivers of the business. The increased volatility, slowdown in new issue and tax over bonds on inflows, led to a 10% decline in U.S. high grade trade, average daily buying compared to the first quarter of 2010. Available transaction fees work modestly from the first quarter of this year. And the decline in overall market trading activity was more than offset by the increase in U.S. high grade market share, and continue to recapture strength. Variable fees per million of $175 remained flat in the second quarter, selecting the continued positive impact of the regional LOC plan. The 17.2 million in variable transaction fees accounted for 58% of total commission reflecting a healthy mix in our business and the inherent earnings leverage from a variable plan. Redistribution fees remain stable, and we expect them to be relatively unchanged in the second half of 2010. Slide nine, highlights our improved clients in dealer participation. As Rick mentioned earlier, our total market making dealer count now stands at 80 dealers up from 60 a year ago. Importantly, new dealer activity helps to improve liquidity or a institutional client and enhance our variable feet for million capture. Recent credit markets volatility again highlight the importance of the increasing participation of the new dealers. 14% of the volume and 21% of the trade counts were executed by new dealers in the second quarter. The new dealer activity by volume more than doubled from the year ago. We are pleased with the overall inquiry count growth along with the increase in the number of investor firms that traded no the system across all products categories. Slide 10, highlights our technology and information services Eurobond and other trading category. In record quarter, from Greenline Financial Technologies led to a 38% increase in technology and information services revenues versus the second quarter of last year. We are seeing attractive growth in software sales and maintenance as well as in professional services. Sovereign-related event risk impacted European market conditions in the second quarter. Our Eurobond commission revenues were flat compared to the second quarter of 2009 and down 15% from the first quarter of 2010. We have taken steps to improve our competitive position in Europe including expanding the range of trading protocol hosting, including click-to-trade and by increasing free trade price transparency for our clients by better integrating market data into our system. The European credit trading market is indeed different from the U.S. market, due a higher portion of trading volume that is composed of high tech account, retail oriented client. There are new trading protocol we have effectively expanded our addressable market and expect to be able to capture more of this volume over time. Finally other commission increased 37% from the second quarter of last year. And other volumes were up 74% driven primarily by U.S. agencies and emerging markets. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results.
Tony DeLise: Thank you Kelly. Please turn to slide 11 for our earnings results. Our record revenue of $35.3 million increased 37% from a year-ago primarily driven by trading volume improvement. Total expenses were $23.5 million up 17% in the second quarter of 2009 largely due to higher employee compensation costs. Income before taxes was a record $11.9 million up 107% from the second quarter of 2009. Incremental margin for the first half of 2010 versus the first half of last year was 63%. This means that $0.63 of additional revenue dollar fell to the pretax income line. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 was 39.5% and consistent with the rate we reported in the first quarter. We expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 39% to 41% reflecting the benefits of the state tax modification that we discussed at year end. Our diluted earnings per share of $0.18 was the highest quarterly EPS we have generated as a public company. On slide 12, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volume and fee per million. Distribution fees of $12.3 million were up $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2009, due principally for the addition of several major dealers of the past year. Excluding any migration of a regional dealer up to the major plan we expect the distribution fees in the second half of the year will be consistent with the first half of the year. Local fees per million were inline with the first quarter and up slightly from the second quarter of 2009. At a more detailed level the increase in U.S. high grade fee capture versus the first quarter of 2010 and then second quarter of 2009 was due largely to the higher commission rate under the regional dealer fee plan. In connection with the trade launch, the Europe on fee plan was revised as a standard commission rate was established across most types of bond. Going forward, we expect the fee capture on European trading volume to be approximately $100 per million. The other product category fee captured declined versus prior period, due to a larger percentage of volume and product that carry a lower fee per million principally agency bond. Assuming agency bond volume growth continues, we would expect the fee capture in the other product category to trend downward. Slide 13, provides you with the expense detail. Employee compensation and benefits increased by $2.3 million from the second quarter of 2009 as a result of higher incentive compensation which is tied to operating performance and an increase in employee headcount. Employee headcount increased from 200 as of June 30, 2009 to 222 as of June 30, 2010. The majority of the new hired related to the expansion in our dealer and client networks and new initiatives. We expect to add additional resources in the second half of this year to support our TTM and other ongoing trading initiatives. During our first quarter call, we indicated that our full year 2010 expenses are trending toward the higher end of our guidance range. Based on our updated plans, we are revising our expense guidance for full year 2010 to a range of 94 to $96 million. On slide 14, we provide balance sheet information. Cash, cash equivalent and securities as of June 30, were 188 million or $4.75 per diluted share compared to $174 million at yearend 2009 and $145 million as of June 30, 2009. With the recent earnings performance we are quickly utilizing our U.S. federal tax loss carried forward. The current level of earning, we would expect to be in a federal tax paying position during the second half of 2011. Total stockholders equity including the series B preferred stock with $260 million as of June 30, 2010 representing book value on a diluted basis of $6.59 per share. We continued to have no bank debt. Now I will return the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: Our strategy to expand our trading network and our product capabilities is paying off with record revenues, earnings and cash flow. We are pleased with our growth rates and continue to believe that our operating leverage will drive earnings growth. In addition to existing products, we are excited about the new opportunities emerging in the OGC derivative space. We are actively investing the benefits from the regulatory changes and we believe the opportunity is such that electronic trading in fixed income markets is getting larger. I would now like to open the call for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Sidoti. Please proceed.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Was wondering you guys mentioned just quickly about the sequential increase in the U.S. variable fee per million during the quarter. Was wondering if you can, may be touch on in a little bit more detail about kind of what's driving that.
Tony DeLise: There's three things that typically drive the U.S. high grade fee capture. It's the contribution from the dealers under the regional, participating under the regional program. It's also what duration and size mix, the size of trade over the platform also impacted fee capture. The third item is the contribution and the execution services debt. And I just mentioned those three, it's really in those three priorities that drove the fee capture, so most of what you saw both compared to the first quarter and compared to the second quarter of last year which driven by the increase in the regional dealer execution fees that are generated under that program.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Okay. And I guess concerning there were eight dealers that were added across the platform. Can you just talk about I guess the incremental benefit from them? Collectively what type of ability do you see in their collective – the ability to add liquidity to the platform I guess collectively from these newer dealers?
Kelly Millet: As we referenced, we went from 60 market making dealers to 80 in the current period. I think they have a benefit in the number of different ways. First the Tony's point obviously with 14% of the volume and 21% of the count being executed by that group, obviously, it add and supports the high fee capture. That can be what we have found as we've added these dealers is those dealers tend to have some specialization either by industry segment or specific relationships with specific clients or greater or more effect performance in certain bucket sizes specifically lower or smaller size trade. So it's really a combination of those three things that we believe make that program important to what we're doing and continue to support the modest growth in share that we saw in the second quarter as well as to continue strengthen in a fee capture.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: And I guess considering some of the trends we been seeing here with a moderation of new asset flows into taxable funds and couple of months of year-on-year declines in trades volume inclusive of July here. But can you just talk about the company – the confidence level in the company's ability to grow market share to kind of offset some of these headwinds and what kind of you think has to happen in order to get back to may be a double-digit type market share in the U.S.?
Kelly Millet: I think you if look back historically if you recall that as we peaked our market share that was double-digit, a substantial portion of that nearly 3% of that was driven by the FRN business. And to this point there is less FRN business in the market place unless at risk FRN business. So to your point as we look at our fixed share at 8.1% or there about which is close to an all time high. We tackle this in a number of fairly straight forward ways. The first is to improve the size and quality of the network by adding dealers as we discussed by documenting and having a material number of new clients trading at least one actively on the systems. So it's connecting and obviously expanding that network. In addition there is a lot of ongoing work from an FTP and kind of activity standpoint to ensure that we are more fully integrated in to the buy side or the management system and the straight through processing and efficiency benefits for both the buy side and sale side. And then obviously we look for ways to utilize technology especially in the smaller size trade to take advantage of less resistance in the smaller trade side. And there are a number of technology initiatives in place to make responses too, and hopefully the quality and quantitative response to claim increase in those smaller trade sizes more effectively.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: Right. Great, color there. And just a question or two on Europe, I think you mentioned about the variable fee per million trending down, because of the focus on some of the retail trading of effect maybe going on there and I think you mentioned about $100 million in fee capture, do you anticipate that will be something that will drive quickly, you know to that level in 3Q or towards that level as you ramp-up activity on that type of trade?
Tony DeLise: On the fee capture in connection with the launch in early June we did an immediate change to the fee grade. So, you're going to see you know beginning with Q3 you should see that captured closer to $100 per million as we -- as we made that fee -- that fee change across most of the products and really we did it in conjunctions with both protocol. So both that quick to trade sort of indicative live market protocol as well as request for whole protocol you know both of those will have a similar or standard fee grade.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti: And then last question I had -- I guess looking at some of the volume in Europe, can you talk just about whether or not you think I realize if there is not a treasure reporting system to gages as much as you can do in the U.S., but can you talk about, I guess what you think whether or not a shift more towards telephone based trading given some of the malaise is going on there or just maybe a reduction in overall activity?
Kelly Millet: I mean these are conversion with my dealer colleague in London. There sort of collected view is that number one, overall trading volumes in Europe were depressed especially in the sort of peak of the recent sovereign debt prices through that period of sort of four to six week, and including an anticipation of the stress test results that are just down. In addition, as I got a little bit more granular, they also said that the total volume of e-trading across a number of platforms was down as well. So to your point, now I would aggregate volume down but there was more of that volume being traded sort of more on an agency basis by phone. We would expect but again it's just a view that with the stabilization at least currently in sovereign debt spread as well as what appears to be a reasonable market acceptance of the European stress test results that European market conditions should stabilize. And then hopefully, if they do, we have the right tools as I said earlier to capture more of the investment of market in the European marketplace.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.
Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill: Rick, to move on to the opportunity from the financial reform in the U.S. and I know it's early here. But it seems to be one unique opportunity you have really how you positioned yourself as with the buy side relationships, with the institutional batches and what the dealers. Can you give us some flavor of what kind of conversation do you having with people, as you position for being a flop execution facility both on the institutional side and the dealer side.
Rick McVey: Sure I'd be happy to, I think as you point out, it is early days. We have broad principles established so far in the Reform Bill and many unknown details to follow in the rule making process from the key regulators. So we do think it's probably 12 to 18 months before rules are finalized and implemented. And given the amount of uncertainty in the details, there's is not a lot of knowledge yet on exactly how this will play out in terms of clearable swaps and swap execution facilities in major market participants. Having said that I think everyone realizes that there is likely to be a significant transition to e-trading for major market participants and financial institutions in standardized swaps. And as we look into the detail from DTCC in the CDS space, a significant portion of the CDS volume isn't what we consider to be standardized swaps, either the industries or the actively traded names. So I think institutional clients as well as dealers are starting to prepare for a fairly significant transformation in the CDS markets that will entail a significant increase to the amount of electronic trading activity.
Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill: And just in the sense you can get a little deeper on what the institutions are looking for them from the market. If they are more interested in solutions that aren't through the traditional dealer relationships that they have, the voice-based ones in looking more electronically now, or they have been on hold for a bit, waiting for the regulation or sort of just uncertainty.
Kelly Millet: There has been a high degree in uncertainty obviously just into the fundamental things such as the definition of a clearable swap. And I think there is a lot of dialogue around, but no certain outcome about where one things such securities or CDS will trade. As you know the indices tend to be the more liquid larger size trades. There is some discussion within the dealer and (inaudible) community that question whether that can trade in a true and exchange model. Even with the liquidity there is some skepticism that there is not sufficient continuous liquidity for that to occur. The feedback that we have gotten from both (inaudible) by-side and it's very preliminary is that they could imagine a handful of different protocols. There could be something along the lines of a request for stream where people provide life crisis for a great re-period of time and then refresh. There could be a more traditional request for market whether you ask for a bid and an offer without disclosing the by-side size intent our market that has then from there launch in RFQ or simply launching our Q with a typical benefits of price discovery and all the inherent sneak through processing and efficiency most likely with shorter timers, or a shorter at risk periods versus the cash market. So our job is to ensure from both a sales perspective as well as from the technology perspective that we can deliver multiple protocols soon such that as the market evolves more towards an accepted standard of execution we are fully prepared to capture that business.
Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill: Is that if I connect the dots here appropriately that part of the additional headcount resources and your spending for the remainder of this year?
Kelly Millet: Yeah. We, as Tony mentioned it's principally associated with the new initiatives it was notably CDS. Not surprisingly there is a significant portion of that in our technology world as we have a dedicated CDS technology group as well as some other elements of the CDS strategy from both – both from a regulatory marketing and sales perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: One for Rick or Kelly to kick off, I guess back to broader financial service reform, Rick as you noted very early days but specifically like what are the key provisions you are going to watch during this room making process. And what should we be watching to guess just how big of a potential winner this can be for you?
Rick McVey: Great question, I think a numbers of pieces are important to determine the likely opportunity for MarketAxess in the E-trading space. One is which swaps well in fact be clearable, the clearable swaps are the ones that trigger the E-trading requirement. So there is detail to follow in terms of what percentage of the swap market ultimately will be clearable by one of the clearing organizations. Secondly I think there is important detail to follow on the exact principles around swap execution facilities. We are very confident that we will qualifies the swap execution facility, we don't know yet how broadly those rules will be written and how many other swap execution faculties are likely to be in the market. So, I think that's an important piece as well. We think that the definition around major market participants there are subject be trading mandates are more clear currently and the way we see that is most significant players in this CDS space are probably going to be in the major market participant category and they would be require to trade there swaps electronically. So those are some of the areas that we're watching closely in terms of determining ultimately, what the e-trading opportunity looks like for us. I'd say also we remain confident that we will see on the back of standardization of swap contracts central clearing and more transparency a broader set of industry participants without the significant concerns about around bilateral credit risk, we think the OTC derivatives market will allow more market marker to participate actively in the market and we continue to believe that more institutional investors will utilize the OTC derivative market more actively. So, I think that the other important piece, how it is what ultimately, do the overall market volumes look like on the back of these changes, and in our view is currently that we will see growth there as well.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Rick it feels like the company will continue to do this relatively de novo with what you've got and organic build out, but just you know thoughts on the acquisition landscape and do you think just now that we have the passage of legislation that could accelerate industry consolidation?
Rick McVey: I think as we pointed out several tax today we think our organic growth opportunity is growing, so that continues to occupy most of our time and attention is capitalizing on that larger addressable market. And as you know in the e-trading landscape there are just a not that many viable entities in the marketplace currently, so there are limited opportunities in the e-trading space for acquisitions although we continue to look at them. And it remains to be seen swap execution facilities will require. We think new staffs in order to manage the regulatory responsibilities that go with that and its certainly possible that you will see an increase in consolidation in order for companies to build the scale and critical mass to make it more cost effective to participate in the new regulatory regime.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: And then final from me, I know there is a few things going on in that other bucket. I mean Tony you touched how to think about the impact of agency growth on the revenue capture. But I guess just more broadly, just could we get a flavor for what's going on within the big buckets of other obviously U.S. agencies continuing to be good market share story but also kind of high yield in the EM business as well?
Tony DeLise: Yes. We don't breakout specific detail. But that being said, we have seen a good performance in our EM market. I think a lot of that is a function, as you know the market has been very robust. And a lot of trades in EM bucket now as investment grade, whether it is in Latin America, parts of Asia, as well as in parts of Europe. We like that business and we are continuing to push to grow that business not only outright in the U.S., but working with European customers in order to trade that emerging markets for us as well. We are seeing signs of a more stable, high-yield environment, from the market making and risk taking stand point, and we are seeing some signs of improvement in our own activities there. And that's the real focus, in addition to a number of the other things that we addressed including U.S. market share, our trade and execution businesses, our information and technology businesses. But high yield has a very high fee capture and therefore, we are spending some special attention to address some of the specific issues being both dealer and client issues as well as modern technology issues to look to continue to accelerate that growth. Ultimately if the fee capture is declining a bit, it's a function of the agency businesses doing well, slight takeaway from that situation strength, and a growing market and the increase in revenue, obviously, in that other category.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Michael Wong with Morningstar. Please proceed.
Michael Wong – Morningstar: In terms of your swap execution facility, are you looking at any other swaps besides CDS? And will your swap execution facility have any type of hybrid broker component?
Kelly Millet: Two quick questions given that our primary focus is always been credit, CDS is the logical extension for us into the CDS space. Having said that, we would not exclude other types of our derivatives -- derivative contracts including the interest rates swap market but I think you should expect us to focus primarily on the CDS space.
Michael Wong – Morningstar: And I guess this wasn't touched upon, but were there any material impact this quarter due to changes in exchange rates?
Tony DeLise: On the FX impacted, really was not that significant in the second quarter either versus the first quarter of '09 more than second quarter of 2009. From a revenue standpoint, the foreign exchange impact was less than $200,000 and on the expense side, it was right around $100,000 so revenues were approximately $200,000 lower because of the strengthening of the dollar versus the pound, principally.
Michael Wong – Morningstar:  And in terms of, can you just go into a little bit more of why you're making the European fee change?
Tony DeLise: Yeah. Sure.
Michael Wong – Morningstar: Is it a real competitive environment over there and you just need to be price more for the market?
Tony DeLise: Right. When we introduced the new clip to trade or what is a sort of live market hitter list on a dealer price tag, we assess the competitive environment for that's specific trading protocol. And it was the assessment that the approximate $100 per million was appropriate given that competitive environment. And obviously, we've been looking at our leading RFQ request for growth platforms, we did not want in a sense to have pricing arbitrage within our own system. But I will summarize my belief in Europe that a lot of the issues that we were faced were European based, market based. We do believe that we will see some stability going forward and we are very excited about expanding our trading protocols. Because as I said earlier we generally believe that the European market is different as large private banking institutions I think as you are aware in Switzerland, Germany, France, etcetera. Our high volume sort of ticket oriented trading desk which don't in a sense lend themselves to the traditional request for protocol. So by introducing this new click-to-trade protocol we opened that addressable market which us significant in the European arena and we think we kind of capture that addressable market for that over time.
Michael Wong – Morningstar: And I guess my final question, can you just reconcile your revenue, sequential revenue increase versus the large fixed income revenue declines at some of the major i-banks and broker dealers. Is it just because you are a pure agency and may be didn't have some excess outside profits that is needed to be taken away. Or whether you believe they were taking losses on their inventory?
Rick McVey: Yeah I think if you look at our sequential increases its coming from a number of areas, it does reflect the opportunity that lies ahead for E-trading because even with leadership position in the electronic trading market in the U.S. for corporate bond trading we are still on the 8% of the overall market. So there is plenty of opportunity to grow share and perform well even an environment where the overall market may not be form --performing as well as it has in the recent past. But I think if you look across the board, we did very well in the number of categories. We have a small market share increased in the U.S high grade, Kelly and Tony, spoken about the fee capture increase as our newer regional dealers become more active on the system. The other category is growing actively as we pointed out and the contribution is coming from our technology information service business is growing. So the nice part about our markets position right now is we have many, many ways go grow revenues and earnings in any market environment, I think you're seeing some of that coming through in the second quarter results.
Operator: We currently have no more questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you so much for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-04-30 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Trey Gregory - Head of Marketing & Communications Rick McVey - Chairman & CEO Kelly Millet - President Tony DeLise - CFO
Analysts: Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs Howard Chen - Credit Suisse Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company Justin Hughes - Philadelphia Financial Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you standing by. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a remainder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, April 28, 2010. I would now like to turn the call over to Trey Gregory, Head of Marketing and Communications at MarketAxess.
Trey Gregory: Good morning and welcome to MarketAxess first quarter 2010 conference call. For the call Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will review the highlights for the quarter; Kelly Millet, President; who will provide an update and trends in our businesses; and Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, who will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial conditions may differ, possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. I'd also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2010 results. We are pleased to report another set of strong quarterly results with record revenues is $34.9 million up 42% from a year ago and record pre-tax income of $11.1 million, 134% above the first quarter of 2009. The strong revenue growth combined with operating leverage let to a market improvement in operating margins to approximately 32%. EPS of $0.17 was more than doubled year-ago levels. Variable transaction fees were the largest contributor to revenue growth and were up 64% from a year ago primarily due to higher volumes. Fee capture per million traders remain strong and total trading volume at $99 billion with 65% above a year-ago and the highest since pre-credit crisis levels in the second quarter of 2007. Investor order flow into this system was up 24% and we now have 72 dealers globally up from 48 one year ago. Our efforts to add new dealers to expand the liquidity pool resulted in better cap rates that continued to drive our trading volumes higher.  Slide four provides an update on the current regulatory reform in our CDS platforms. Financial regulatory reforms continues to progress through multiple congressional committees. Pre-proposals have been past, mandating trading of certain clearable swaps on an exchange or a swap execution facility. Although the final form of any regulatory action and the implementation timeframe are still subjected to debate. We see the recent regulatory activity as favorable fro electronic trading and we intend to register and operate a swap execution facility. We have and will take actions necessary to capitalize on the reform legislation, especially as it relates to credit default swaps. We’ve already developed CDS trading engines for index, signal name and bid offer list of trading. We have an established network of institutional credit market participants. To available first trade APIs, we can quickly connect to order management systems, confirmation hubs and clearing houses as our customers chose. Last week we announced the appointment of Dr. Sharon Brown-Hruska, a former Commissioner of the CFTC to our Board. Sharon will increase our knowledge of the regulatory environment and its likely impact on derivative trading. Slide five provides an update on market conditions. Over the past year credit market conditions continue to normalize with lower credit spreads and credit spread volatility. After peaking in the third quarter of 2008 high-grade credit spreads as measured by the Credit Suisse Lucy Index continued to decline, ending the quarter at 118 basis points over US Treasuries.  Credit spread by volatility decline further during the quarter of remains about free crisis levels. During the first quarter non-government guaranteed new issue volume was the highest has been since the second quarter of 2008. The steep yield curve continues to be a driving factor for strong inflows into taxable bond funds in ETS, creating additional demand for corporate bonds and other credit assets. All of these factors have contributed through a robust credit trading environment, which we currently expect to continue for the balance of 2010. Now, let me turn to call over to Kelly for more detail regarding our first quarter business results.
Kelly Millet: Thank you, Rick. Slide six summarizes the trading volume across our product categories. Overall global volume was $99 billion was up 65% year-over-year marking our strongest quarterly results since the second quarter of 2007. In the US high-grade volumes rose to $62 million, up 67% year-over-year and 11% from the fourth quarter of last year. Our estimated US high-grade market share of trades was 7.9%, up strongly from 5.7% one year ago, down marginally from fourth quarter level. Eurobond volumes were $16 billion, up 76% year-over-year, but down 11% from the fourth quarter of last year. Influenced by market issues in sovereign debt and other factors, I will talk more about our European business shortly. Our other category driven by US agencies and emerging markets trading volume grew to $22 billion, up 53% year-over-year, and up 16% from the previous quarter. Slide seven, highlights the revenue drivers of the business. US high-grade trade volumes remain robust, driven by a number of factors that Rick spoke to earlier. Global fees per million of the quarter of $172 were down $8 from last quarter and inline with year ago, but remain well above the levels before the credit crisis. As a reminder, these per million are influenced by factors such as average duration of securities traded on the systems, the general dealer activity and the metal of activity of our high-grade execution desk. Total variable transaction fees were $17.1 million in the first quarter of 2010 up 64% from the first quarter of 2009, and were 58% of total commission. We are pleased with the sequential growth of our variable transaction fees over the past five quarters. Distribution fees were $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2010, fees from new dealers have more than offset those we lost during 2008 and early 2009 due to dealer combinations in bankruptcies, and demonstrates the importance of our dealer expansion. Slide eight highlights our improved clients and dealer participation. Hit rates for the percentage of client inquiries that result in trade continued to improve across all product categories. In US high-grade, we saw a hit rate of 74% by trade count, up from 59% in the first quarter of last year. The high-grade hit rate increased due to the improvement in market condition, as well as the increase in the number of liquidity providing dealer, which grew to 72 from 48 a year ago. The new dealers continued to be an important contributor to liquidity and represented 21% of the number of trades executed.  In addition to the expansion of our dealer network, we are also pleased with the increased in client inquiry count and the growing number of investor firms that traded on the system, across all major broader categories compared to the year ago. The continued strength of our trading network is not only a key revenue driver, but create substantial barriers to entry, especially in the US market and creates efficiency regarding best execution and seamless straight-through processing for our customers.  Slide nine, highlights our Eurobond and other trading category. European commission revenue was $5.5 million up 33% compared to first quarter of last year. Although, revenue declined 8% from last quarter, despite a volatile sovereign debt market and greater competition in electronic trading in Europe, we were pleased at the number of investor clients executing at least one Eurobond trade grew by 10% in the quarter. We are currently expanding our European trading protocols to serve the specific trading patterns of our clients, giving them greater flexibility in how they trade credit. Furthermore in a market that lacks a TRACE likely reporting mechanism, we are actively working to integrate more robust data and more efficient price discovery into the European system. Our other trading volumes increased 53% and commissions for the category were $4 million up 45% from the first quarter 2009. Within the other category the emerging markets franchisee continues to grow and we saw a more favorable balance between sovereign and corporate debt trading activity across the platform. We are pleased with this result and look to grow this business and provide greater trading opportunities for our client network. We feel the more products that investor clients trade the greater the stickiness of the platform and this leads to more usage of the platform overall. In closing our focus remains on expanding our client and dealer network delivering diverse an appropriate trading protocols to meet the market need and providing connectivity that allow our clients to take full advantage of the benefits e-trading. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial result.
Tony DeLise:  Thank you, Kelley. Please turn to slide 10 for our earnings performance. Our record revenue of $34.9 increased 42% from a year ago, primarily driven by trading volume improvements. Technology product and services also contributed to revenue growth with a 56% increase from the first quarter of 2009. We have signs of improvement in the IT spending environment and are cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the rest of 2010. Total expenses were $23.8 million, up 20% in the first quarter of 2009, largely due to higher employee compensation cost and onetime expenses, which I'll talk more about shortly. Income before taxes was a record $11.1 million up 134% in the first quarter of 2009. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 39.5%. We expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 39% to 41% reflecting the benefits of the state tax modifications that we discussed at year end. Our diluted earnings per share at $0.17 with the highest we have generated as a public company. Our diluted share count increased by $1.8 million compared to first quarter of 2009 largely due to the impact that our share price has on the treasury method compensation. Asking any significant issuance or retirement of shares we would expect to share count to change by approximately 150,000 to 200,000 shares for every one dollar change in our average share price to the period. On slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees for million. Distribution fees of $12.2 million were up $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2009 due principally to the addition of several major dealers over the past year. Excluding any migration of a regional dealer up to the major plan we expect the distribution fees for the second quarter to be inline with the first quarter. As volumes continue to grow for certain regional dealers some conversions to the major plan may occur. We expect any conversions to be revenue neutral as well as variable transaction fees would be offset by higher distribution fees. As Kelly mentioned, global fees for per million were inline with the year ago, but were down $8 in the fourth quarter of 2009 at a more detailed levels, the decline in US high-grade fee capture versus the fourth quarter was due to shorter average duration of bonds traded on the system combined with the smaller contributions in the high-grade execution and trading desk. The other product category fee capture declined versus the fourth quarter due to a larger percentage of volumes in products that carry a lower fee per million. Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. Our expenses of $23.8 million were 20% above the first quarter of 2009 and fully compensation and benefit increased by $2.5 million from the first quarter of 2009 as a result of higher employee compensation and benefits increased by $2.5 million from the first quarter of 2009, as a result of higher employee compensation, which is tied to operating performance and an increase in employee headcount. Employee headcount increased from 198 as of March 31, 2009, to 219 as of March 31, 2010. The majority of the new highlights were added in 2009 to support the expansion of our dealer and client networks, and new initiatives. During the first quarter of 2010, we also incurred approximately $625,000 in one-time expenses provided to the move of our new headquarters and the Heady-Charity Trading Day. We are proud to report that we’ve raised and donated $178,000 to the American Red Cross to eight victims of the earthquake Haiti. You recall that during our year end earnings call, we provided full-year 2010 expense guidance of $90 million to $94 million. Currently, we believe that the full-year 2010 expenses are trending towards a higher end of that range, which represents approximately a 10% increase in expenses over full-year 2009. On slide 13, we provide balance sheet information; cash, cash equivalents and securities as of march 31, were $168 million, or $4.27 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $174 million at year end of 2009. The decrease in cash is largely due to the payment of annual bonuses during the first quarter of 2010, and $2.9 million of capital expenditures and move cost associated with our new premises in New York City. Total stockholders’ equity including the Series B preferred stock was $253 million as of March 31, 2010 representing book value on a diluted basis of $6.42. We continued to have no bank debt. Slide 14 displays our historical cash balances, investment returns, and capital management priorities. While we expected short-term rates will normalizes overtime the current rate environment that had a significant negative impact on our investment returns. At current cash levels, every 1% increasing rates would improve earnings per share by approximately $0.03 annually. Capital management continues to be in area of focus as we evaluate ways to best deploy our capital. We are investing in an organic growth opportunities, we continued to evaluate business acquisition opportunities in addition of product segments, or to round at our connectivity and market data capabilities; and we also have a program in place to return capital to our shareholders via our regular quarterly cash dividend. We believe that our balance sheet is financially sound enough to pursue all three priorities simultaneously. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey:  Our strategy to expand our institutional trading network throughout the credit crisis is paying off with record revenues and earnings as the markets continued to recover. We are pleased with the growth that we are seeing in all of our major product areas, and continue to believe that our operating leverage will drive attractive earnings growth. In addition to growth in existing product areas, we are excited by the new opportunities emerging as part of the regulatory reform process. We believe the opportunities set for electronic trading and fixed income market is getting larger. I would now like to open the call for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) and your first question comes from the line of Daniel Harris with Goldman Sachs; please proceed.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Rick, you led off with some discussion about regulatory reform, and my guess is most people who are listening have been dealing with this now for sometime. We’d love to get your thoughts on how you see things progressing and impacting your businesses and cash bonds? Bonds, but then also, if you start to say conversation pretty quickly with a discussion of your CDS opportunities and just capabilities, I’d love to hear how you think that’s progressed in terms of conversations you’ve been having over the last quarter or two with market participants.
Rick McVey: First although there is nothing specific in the regulatory reform proposals dealing with our cash fixed income markets, our belief is that, if the market comes to the conclusion that more electronic trading is a good idea for the fairness and openness of derivative markets they will also conclude that it is probably a good idea for cash fixed income products. So as a margin, we do believe that the discussion around more electronic trading four derivatives will provide a positive benefit in terms of the adoption rates for cash products. In terms of market participants in the conversations that we’ve been having around CDS, there continues to be an uncertainty about the outcome and timing of the regulatory reform proposals that it is fair to say that there has not been a lot of concrete action yet, with respect to moving forward with electronic trading of CDS, but I think people are paying very close attention to the various parts of the proposal that include greater central clearing for standardized swaps, electronic execution an increased market transparency.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: In a similar being, the Europe, I guess, is to some extent going to what would happens in the US and then follows in their own suit as they see accordingly, but my question is, they don’t have the same kind of structure we have, given there the various countries over there, with TRACE reporting, or any sort of reporting in terms of cash credit. Do you think that that’s something that they will pursue and that you could benefit from?
Kelly Millet: Daniel hi, it’s Kelly. There’s been a much dialogue around transparency from a more official basis, our TRACE. We have not gotten any indication such movement is likely in the short-term. As we looked at competing in the European market, it’s very clear to us that the offering of multiple trading protocols i.e. are traditional RFQ, as well as, sort of have clip the trade capability, and the integration of price discovery or pre-trade analytics, can be a very positive combination. In the short-term as you well aware such analytic or price discovery will have to be more derive from trading on our platform, and potentially derived pricing, as you’re aware from (Inaudible) box for other industry. There in the short-term, unlikely to see a TRACE like products, but clearly a great demand from our buy-side clients and enhancing at least pre-trade, price discovery and we’ll go into deliver the tools to them to begin to do that.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Then just one data point, on slide eight, you guys talked about the percent change in number of investors that are executing at least one trade and it looks like emerging markets is really seeing some pretty rapid growth. Any color around that? And how big of an opportunity do you think that could be relative to your US and European businesses?
Kelley Millet: As I addressed, obviously, the market has been quite robust. As you’re aware, based on the credit quality of the number of the sovereigns and quasi-sovereign that are more commodity based, a number of them are high-grade and a number of them are trading from a spread basis in a similar way. The growth in our business, I think has been our ability to get a better balance between what was the typical e-trading, which would be in the large on the run liquid sovereign, with the addition of corporates. Again, there are a number of corporates in Latin America, in Asia and in a handful of places in Eastern Europe that in fact investment grade. So like in our high-grade business, we are good adding to our dealer’s room and expanding our clients network as well. It’s a little bit difficult to assess the over market opportunities, because as you know the [empty] figures are a little less accurate, or little less comprehensive than the trade figures, but we do think that we can continue to grow that franchise in a reasonable way and continue to offer in my mind a diverse set of products across our larger money managers and other clients, where we do believe that as a trade credit or peer in the Europe, high yield Europe, high yield EMN agencies we’re having more complete offering as I said, earlier we believe accretes is sticking to the system.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: First one, with respect to the current environment in the card business, Rick maybe for best for you, you've clearly been the beneficiary of a lot of healing in the markets. Just wanted to get your view, as we haven't heard in while on the technicals with rates near zero, what are you hearing from the buyer side in terms of kind of cash on the sidelines and just appetite to kind of put that to work? Where we in that kind of conversation, from your point of view?
Rick McVey: I think it’s probably consistent with what all our viewer seeing as longer short rates in money market funds to remain close to zero there’s been a consistent movement out of short-term money market funds and into longer-term bond funds. So the cash flow has been quite positive into the investment management community that tends to be active on our system. As of you is that slightly to persist through the balance of this year. The other trend is clear that most of the money coming out of money market funds is going into bond funds not into equity funds, which we think its part of the longer-term asset allocation shift were our greater percentage of investable assets seem to be going like into fixed income product categories.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Then one for you, Kelley, in your prepared remarks, you spoke to a pickup in terms of the European competitive landscape. I was just curious if you could elaborate on that a little bit.
Kelley Millet: Where as in the US, the dominant trading protocol is the user’s Request For Quote or RFQ and such work is typically dominated by the list business. There is a more varied trading protocol or protocols in Europe. The large what I’ll call aggregators of private wealth, not surprisingly in Germany, Switzerland and the like, and so more of a work process that is click the trade, so they see a level, they see it in a stack, they hit a list subject to dealer confirmation. Members have a reasonable presence in that market place, so what’ve done and what we will be delivering is a competing product that will sit aside or [Q] capability and we believe provides a more competitive and compelling offering in that click to trade space, that opens up a whole series of investors for that we really didn’t have a meaningful dialogue because that work process dominated their trading day. So if I can deliver and we will and RQ, a click to trade and the integration of data and pre-trade price discovery, and then we think collectively in total we have a superior offering to anyone of the individual offerings in the European market place.
Operator: And you next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Sidoti & Company.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: I was wondering if you guys could maybe talk a little bit about, given that some of the scrutiny maybe some of the larger broker-dealers have been coming under, just regarding concerns about their delivering practices, maybe levering up during the quarter and kind of levering down towards the end of the quarter, and some investigation on that, do you think that that might influence their market making capabilities on a go forward basis and whether or not you feel that the regional dealers that you have coming online could pick up the slack, but just was wondering if you could give us a little bit of your thoughts and color on that?
Kelley Millet:  Hugh, its Kelley. As you know, through the credit crisis, as you know at the Fed datas, the corporate bonds and the balance sheet of the primary dealers fell precipitously through that process and it really did drive our efforts to expand the liquidity tool by adding dealer to the platform. As I said in my prepared remarks those new dealers drove about 21% in trade count of our transactions in the first quarter. I think there are a couple of things to note, it does appear that the larger dealers are using more balance sheet, but they are no where near the levels pre-crisis. Secondly, within that sort of new dealer discussion there are number of very large dealer and not just regional for smaller regional and we think those that are reentering or entering to the market for the first time like in Nomura or a Susquehanna or a Citadel, can add substantial liquidity given the nature of their capital. Finally we do believe that the regionals will benefit given the nature of their relationships in a sense with their downstream or end buyers or clients. So, in total I think we see a couple of interesting positive trends large dealers getting a little bit bigger, a little bit more important within the new dealer a number of larger dealers in a sense new or reentering the marketplace that can provide significant capital to that liquidity market making. And then the regionals we feel having an increased stature in terms of their ability within their defined business model to again add liquidity to our system. So we think at the margin of those trends should be beneficial to help our hit rate. As we discussed, it’s up significantly first quarter this year to 74% and we do believe that has a room to run from there.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Rick McVey: I would just add to that as well. I think what we consistently hear from our investor clients is that they want a diverse set of liquidity providers to be prepared for any market or regulatory environment. And we think we’ve been consistently delivering that to them with the expansion in our dealer community on the market access system and what we’re seeing in terms of the momentum and the increase in volumes on the platform, we think reflects the fact that the only efficient way for investor to deal with a larger set of dealer counterparties is to trade more electronically. And we think that’s coming through clearly and we believe that’s a long term trend.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: That's great. And I guess maybe as a follow-up to that comment and I apologize, I didn't kind of see in the slides, so I wasn't sure of it, the new dealer approval rates, because obviously you are bringing all the dealers, trying to get them on to your client platforms and there is a need for additional dealers that are providing liquidity and maybe some of the others aren't, are you seeing any adjustment in trends there with the client approvals or the dealer approvals?
Rick McVey: I think it can be in a sense two sides of the coin, what we do see is that, we’ll quote, the large new dealers coming on in the platform, we see an approval process that is slightly higher than the historical -- a factor than the historical timeframe to approve them to get to critical mass. As the liquidity has returned to the marketplace, clients are being a little bit more selective in terms of the approval of certain regional. So net-net we feel like we’re on track slightly ahead of phase with the larger dealers, but clearly remain a key focus. And it really does vary by type of investor by the way, which they trade our index sponsors and insurance companies, but that we will continue to be a real focus for the team and that provide real upside in terms of gaining a greater degree of client input to that group of new dealers.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company : Great. And I guess maybe an area that you didn't spend as much focus on -- the opportunities that you guys are seeing and demand for the financial technology services and so forth. Is there anything that you are kind of seeing strengthening there?
Rick McVey: Yeah, the overall environment I think as Tony mentioned appears to be better and whether you look at earnings from technology companies or you read varies letters or surveys in the marketplace. We are seeing some modest improvement and a more regulars sales process in our GST business which as you know is the fixed monitoring certification of business and we’re also seeing some demand from our dealer and client group for helping the aggregation of various easy and pricing and evaluating how one could in a sense, auto quote and perform more efficiently on our platform, especially in the moderately smaller guidance. So as Tony said, we are cautiously optimistic for our combined tech service and market data business to show improved results throughout the year. But again, you can be very dependent sort of case-by-case in terms of budgets that are being provided as well as IT priorities. But we do feel like the overall environment seems to be a bit healthier in 2010 versus 2009. 
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Good, great. And the last question, I guess, is something that we always kind of touch base and harp on, but given the strength of the balance sheet, I know obviously you had some growth opportunities organically in strengthening the platform. But does it seem as though there looks to be any opportunities on the horizon from an acquisition standpoint, if not in that regard, would there be the potential for a dividend raise at some point go forward?
Rick McVey:  I think we are actively considering all of the option for the use of our balance sheet and our cash position. On the acquisition front we see things in the market virtually every quarter, we have obviously been selective historically because of the confidence that we have in our organic growth prospects. But we do see some things from time-to-time that would expand our capabilities, especially in the fixed income e-trading, connectivity and data space. So we expect to see more of those opportunities in 2010, but at the same time we will be selective, because of the momentum that we see in our core business. With respect to the dividend, this is our third quarter with the regular dividend the Board will discuss the appropriate level for dividends based on our earnings and cash flow on a quarterly basis and as we’ve said, the first time out with the dividend announcement nine months ago, we felt that something around the area is referred as our free cash flow and a dividend yield of 2% or slightly better was the right area to target.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from the line Justin Hughes with Philadelphia Financial. Please proceed.
Justin Hughes - Philadelphia Financial: The one thing I wanted to dig into a little bit more is on your variable fee rates; if we could just dig into the US high-grade. That was flat year-over-year, but down quite a bit quarter-over-quarter. I'm just kind of wondering what’s driving that and what should we expect it to do going forward?
Tony DeLise:  Justin this is Tony. That, US high-grade fee capture rate there are lots of item that impact that rate from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the two single biggest items with the shorter average duration of bonds traded on the platform as well as a lower contribution from our hybrid execution desk and you will that average duration, it will probably hit all time highs at least over the five year, all time highs during 2009 and it has migrated down slightly in 2010. The way our fee plan works for high-graded it is depended on duration and also again this is a hybrid trading desk with what’s happened in the market with what’s happened with spreads, the contribution from that business is a little lower in the first quarter then it was in the fourth quarter.
Justin Hughes - Philadelphia Financial:  Okay, and then your market share as a percentage of TRACE dipped down just a little bit, but it is the first kind of drop we've seen in I think about a year. How is that trending in April?
Kelley Millet: Let me just comment, it’s Kelley, briefly on sort of the factors that will influence short term market share. First, obviously is overall market liquidity. The second is, buy side investor flow imbalances i.e. if the market is also want it or didn’t want it. And the third is the percentage of IDT or Inter Dealer Trading as a percent of overall TRACE. So those factors can influence share by a tenth, two-tenth, three-tenth depending on which direction that they move. Although, we don’t forecast our share number as we are still a week or so away from releasing volumes, in the current environment, we don’t see anything that is materially different or out of context in terms of what we saw in the first quarter.
Operator: And you next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.
Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill: Just looking for a little more color on the CDS opportunity, knowing that you're making progress there, but I'm curious little bit on client demand for it. And then there have been advances with the clearinghouses, we've seen ICE's clearinghouse in place for a year. I'm just wondering where you think the market is now, because it seems like in general the CDS market have been sort of beaten down as far as activity goes and if you think it is positioned for a rebound or if it really needs some more regulatory and infrastructure improvements before that market gets robust again?
Rick McVey: Sure. I’m happy to comment on that. I do think the trends in CDS volumes during the course of 2009 were down, but it’s important to remember, it’s still a very larger market and based on the information that we can provide, we think daily volumes in the CDS market are five to eight times higher than they are in the cash credit markets. So it’s still a very large market more than half of that volume seems to be taking place in index products which as you point out or trending toward more central clearing which is helping with the safety and soundness of the CDS system overall. So I think in general the volumes are still quite high in CDS, and importantly our view is that as the infrastructure improvements take hold in CDS, with the answer of more central clearing sound margining system daily market-to-markets and more transparency in the market you will see an increase in market participation in that product going forward, and specifically, we believe that more traditional investment managers are likely to participate in CDS and other derivative markets. On the back of some of the improvements in infrastructure that are taking place. 
Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill: Okay. And I think about your client bases, is it safer to say they skew more toward the traditional side than the hedge fund side?
Rick McVey: I think that’s a logical conclusion given it’s a vast majority of trading that we do today is in cash credit products, which is the demand of the traditional investment managers and insurance companies, the hedge funds tend to be clients with market access and they are signed up for trading, but given that historically most of their volume has been in CDS, as they are not today as active as the traditional investment management community.
Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill:  And then just one quick one for Tony here, the comment that expenses might be at the high end of that $94 million, just using the first quarter as a run rate; it looks like you are above that level right now. So I guess the implication is out quarters might be a tad lower than the current quarter, it’s simple math, but I just want to confirm that's what I'm looking at?
Tony DeLise:  Chris this is Tony. And then in the first quarter and we did had $625,000 of what we’ll call one-time cost.
Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill: Okay, yes.
Tony DeLise: If you back that out there will be some changes in the expenses as we progress during the year, but if you back out with 625, it probably gets you back to that run rate at the higher end of that range then.
Operator: And there are no additional questions in queue. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick McVey for closing remarks. Sir, you may proceed.
Rick McVey:  Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-29 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Trey Gregory – Head of Marketing and Communications Richard McVey – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Kelly Millet – President James Rucker – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Hugh Miller – Sidoti & Company Howard Chen – Credit Suisse
Operator: Welcome to MarketAxess first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Trey Gregory, Head of Marketing and Communications at MarketAxess.
Trey Gregory: Good morning and welcome to MarketAxess first quarter 2009 conference call. On the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review highlights of the quarter, Kelly Millet, President, will provide an update on trends in our businesses and then Jim Rucker, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial conditions may differ, possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. I'd also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick.
Richard McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2009 results. First quarter earnings per share rose to $0.08 versus $0.05 in the first quarter of 2008 as revenues grew primarily due to the new business initiatives that were implemented over the past 12 months. Revenues of $24.6 million were up 7% from a year ago and reflects significantly higher fee capture across all three transaction categories as well as the contribution from technology services. We have continued to maintain expense discipline and as a result, have grown our pre tax operating margin to 19%, up from 13% a year ago. The credit market showed signs of improvement in the first quarter, leading to an increase in overall U.S. high grade corporate bond secondary volumes. were up 30% from the fourth quarter of '08 and up 21% from a year ago.  Investor engagement on the platform remained strong with total inquiry count of 57% from a year ago demonstrating the value we deliver to investors even through extraordinary market conditions. Our total trade volume for the quarter grew 39% from the fourth quarter, but was 7% below year ago levels. Key metrics on financial health are significantly stronger than a year ago. EBITDA for the quarter was up 38% to $6.5 million from $4.7 million last year and our cash balance at quarter end was $137 million or $3.66 per diluted share. We remain focused on helping our clients utilize our trading network to gain access to liquidity in what continues to be a challenging market environment. Kelly will talk in more detail later about the progress we have made with our new initiatives including additional dealers, new market list capabilities and our execution services desk. As you can see on Slide 4, market conditions in the first quarter showed modest signs of improvement. Significantly higher yields in the corporate bond markets are attracting renewed interest in the sector. There were strong inflows into taxable bond funds and corporate bond ETS during the quarter and the new issue calendar was robust. 42% of the new issues supplied during the quarter was in government guaranteed bank debt. Benchmark credit spreads as measured by the Currency Index ended the quarter at 453 basis points, 78 basis points tighter than at the end of the fourth quarter and credit spread volatility remains high. Investor inflows, active new issuance, tighter spreads and higher secondary volumes all point to an improvement in overall credit market conditions. On Slide 5 you can see that investor increase across the platform are at an all time high demonstrating that investors continue to rely on MarketAxess as a unique channel to source liquidity in the credit markets. Investor overall account increased by 57% in the first quarter compared to a year ago. However, the hit rate or percentage of increase resulting in trades while up from the fourth quarter, remains  well below pre crisis levels. This is a sign that liquidity in the credit markets continues to be negatively impacted by reduced capital for market making among key dealers. Primary deal holdings of corporate bonds remain at about one-third of pre crisis levels. These current liquidity challenges in credit markets have led to our recent initiatives on expanding our trading network and adding new connectivity solutions. Now let me turn it over to Kelly to discuss our business initiatives in more detail.
Kelly Millet: We have been proactive in adjusting our business model to enhance liquidity for investor clients in response to current market conditions. On Slide 6 we provide an update around three key new initiatives. First, we continue to accelerate our regional dealer effort. A number of investor clients who have accessed the regional dealers having grown from 236 at the end of last year to 276 by the end of this quarter. The majority of our top 100 U.S. investor clients now have access to multiple regional dealers over the platform. Regional dealers are providing an important source of additional liquidity particularly in the smaller size trades. Second, our efforts around market lists have made good progress during the quarter. This functionality enables institutional investors to display live inquiries to the entire MarketAxess trading community for order matching. We continue to upgrade technology to assist in investors in matching inquiries to their own order books.  Market lists have been well received by our investor base as over 200 investor firms have made at least one list public, up from 120 at the end of last quarter. Furthermore, 31,000 inquiries were submitted to our open order book in the first quarter an increase of 79% over the fourth quarter of 2008. Third, execution services provides an additional source of liquidity to investor clients. That is essentially a hybrid electronic and voice model that seeks matches for inquiries that are not executed in the fully electronic request for quote process. In the first quarter of 2009, there were almost 50,000 investor inquiries that did not trade. Our execution services group also provides fixed income expertise and transaction capabilities to investor clients that do not have bond expertise or established dealer relationships and virtually all of these transactions, MarketAxess functioned as a principal for matched pairs of orders which are settled through our clearing partner. This first full quarter of operations in the executions services group provided invaluable services to both investor and dealer client any source of new revenue to MarketAxess. Slide 7 provides details regarding the drivers of our commission revenue growth during the quarter. Our total commission revenue grew 6% versus the first quarter of 2008 and over 21% versus the previous quarter. Of particular note was the strength in our variable transaction fees which increased 52% from the fourth quarter and 39% from the first quarter of last year. The increase in transaction fees has more than offset the decline in dealer distribution fees over the last year. Importantly, we also saw a significant increase in our fee capture per million which was up 23% over the first quarter of 2008. The increase in fees per million was driven by our execution services desk, variable fees on regional dealer transactions and an increase in the percentage of our volume coming from higher fee products giving a high yield. High yield volumes were up by 94% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Our trading volume for the first quarter were much stronger than in the fourth quarter with increases across all product areas and an overall increase of 39%. They were however, still down from a year ago. There are two primary drivers of the increased volumes; first the improved market conditions. They're reflected in the 30% increase in the quarterly numbers. Our market share picked up modestly in U.S. hybrid from the fourth quarter of 2008. Preliminary indications for April show that fee capture and trades volumes trends remain positive. However, estimated U.S. high grade market share is much weaker than the first quarter average. In addition to the normal monthly market share fluctuations we believe this is due to the difficult time institutional investors are having buying corporate bonds. Please turn to Slide 8 for an update on our European business. Prime engagement on the European platform remains strong. A number of clients that use the platform during the first quarter of 2009 increased 12% compared to the first quarter of last year, and the number of client increase submitted across the platform increased by 147% compared to the first quarter of 2008. The financial metrics for the European business are also favorable. As with the U.S. Business, fee capture has grown compared to a year ago. The 22% increase in fee capture for the European business has been largely driven by a favorable mix of business towards higher margin products. Commission revenue has grown 24% from a year ago in local currency terms, but have been impacted by a significant decline in the U.K. pound compared to the U.S. dollar. Within European commissions while dealer distribution fees are flat over last year, fees are up 87% in local currency. We have both overlap and differences with the U.S. in terms of the initiatives being pursued in Europe. In common with the U.S. we are seeking to add additional dealers and we'll also be rolling out markets lists. A stand alone European initiative, we are also expanding a range of products offered to include capabilities in additional non core currencies. So with that let me turn the call over to Jim for a financial update.
James Rucker: Please turn to Slide 9 for our earnings performance. Revenue grew by over 7% from a year ago driven by higher commission revenue and the contribution from our technology services business. Expenses were held flat and as a result, we saw a 60% increase in pre tax income and an increase in operating margins from 13% to 19%.  Net income of $2.8 million was up 78% from the first quarter of 2008.  The growth in pre tax income came despite the adverse impact of significantly lower yields on our investment portfolio and the decline of the value of the pound compared to the U.S. dollar. These two factors reduced pre tax income by a combined $1.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2008. Technology products and services revenue was up significantly from the year ago due to the acquisition of Greenline in March of 2008 but down $400,000 from Q4. Greenline continues to build a strong sales pipeline and robust product offering which positions them well for future growth. On Slide 10, we've laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Commission revenue was up 21% from the prior quarter and 6% from the first quarter of 2008. Transaction fees grew strongly and were up 52% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and 39% from a year ago driven by the higher fee capture that Kelly spoke to earlier. Fees per million were up across all three categories. This was partially offset by a reduction in distribution fees following the consolidations over the past year in the dealer community as well as the exchange rate impacts I mentioned earlier. Slide 11 provides you with expense detail. Total expenses decreased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2008 but include $1.6 million of incremental operating expenses related to Greenline. Employee compensation and benefits increased by 4% primarily as a result of higher variable incentives and stock based compensation expense. We continue to expect our 2009 full year expenses to be within the previously stated guidance range of $77 million to $84 million. On Slide 12, we highlight the strength in our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and securities as of March 31 were $137 million compared to $143 million at year end 2008 and represented $3.66 per share on a diluted basis.  Annual employee cash bonuses accrued during 2008 were paid out in January 2009. Total shareholders equity as of December 31 was $229 million representing book value on a diluted basis of $6.11. We continue to have no bank debt. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Richard McVey: In conclusion, the first quarter marked an improvement in the overall credit markets and our financial results. Trading volumes, fee capture and market share all improved from the fourth quarter driving an increase in company revenue and earnings. Importantly, new dealers and new trading activities have created a more diversified revenue base. Our earnings results for the quarter serve as a reminder of the attractive operating leverage in our business. We are focused on growing revenues while controlling expenses in order to create attractive returns for our shareholders. Now I will happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from [Hugh Miller – Sidoti & Company]
Hugh Miller – Sidoti & Company: I was wondering if you could us any update on uses of cash. Obviously you continue to look for acquisition opportunities, but at this point whether or not you're seeing anything that looks attractive and what we should expect going forward.
James Rucker: In terms of the cash on the balance sheet we like having the strong cash balances through the current credit market environment. It does give us the flexibility to be able to look selectively at acquisitions that would help us to fill in the business. Clearly if we didn't have that cash on the balance sheet, in the current environment borrowing would be both difficult and expensive. Having said that, we also very much like the internal opportunities that we're working on and to be quite honest at this point, we don't see anything attractive on the acquisition front as those internal organic growth opportunities.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti & Company: I was wondering if Kelly could provide us with a little more insight into the up selling of some of the regional dealers to the fixed rate platform and any impact it may have had on the first quarter performance.
Kelly Millet: We are pleased with the progress as I said in my remarks with the growing importance of the regional dealers. One, they provide a source of additional liquidity especially in the odd lot size category number one, and they also provide based on that financial arrangement a higher fee capture per million. We are working with a handful of those regional's in that sort of undisclosed non disclose program to step in front of the button as we call it or into a disclosed program where they would pay fixed distribution fees subject to the nature, size and type of inquiry that they see. So we are making some progress and we feel reasonably optimistic subject to any merger or other crisis events among the dealer community that we can stabilize our fixed distribution fees throughout 2009.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti & Company: Were there any that stepped in front of the button during the first quarter or is this something that you're looking at more second, third quarter and so on.
Kelly Millet: There are without getting into too much detail, there are several that are now in the disclosed plan but the financial impact in the first quarter from that is relatively muted so if we are going to see some positive impact in stabilizing the fixed distribution fees, we would expect to see that in the later quarters of this year.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti & Company: Obviously you saw a little bit of a compression in the technology service fees relative to the fourth quarter, I was wondering if you could provide us with a little more insight as to what may have transpired during the quarter and what your thoughts are on a go forward basis.
James Rucker: First quarter of 2009 as you can from the numbers was a little more of a difficult environment in technology services and we think that was around budget availability amongst the client base for spending on technology services. The early indication in the second quarter is that things have eased somewhat but it's a little bit too early in the quarter to really make any predictions on where we'll end up.
Hugh Miller – Sidoti & Company: Did you make a comment about market share in April relative to the first quarter and if so, what were those comments?
Kelly Millet: I did. The two positives that we're seeing in the April month to date results is a continued positive trend in fee capture as well as in overall trace activity. We are seeing a lower market share number for April versus the average share to the first quarter. As I look at that, we've seen a real dramatic change over the past six months. In our conversations, as you probably recall, go back six months our investors were looking for bids across the system and were unable to get those bids for a number of reasons including reduced inventory that Rick referenced as really lack of risk taking in the broad dealer community. We find ourselves almost in a polar opposite position reflecting in April where the buyer is looking to go one way which is to offer from the dealer community. Again, given the lack of inventory and our assessment which is a qualitative assessment of the street is not sure, they are having difficulty in sourcing those bonds on an at risk or incent to dealers taking balance sheet risks to short those bonds to the investors. We are seeing therefore as we look at the trace data a continued trend of bonds crossing on a risk list basis in the old fashioned way of sourcing bonds and selling those bonds without using the balance sheet. And obviously that's one element of our new initiative in trading and execution services which is really an extension of our core business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Howard Chen – Credit Suisse.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: On the new issuance chart you broke it out with unguaranteed issuance and the government guaranteed issuance. When you think about those two buckets and particularly the government guaranteed issuance, are you seeing anything interesting in terms of trends on the MarketAxess system with respect to those guaranteed bonds?
Kelly Millet: We have introduced full functionality in trading the FDIC and government guaranteed bonds on our system. You should be aware that the dealer counter parties are trading for the most part those FDIC bonds off of their agency deck and not their corporate credit debts. It's safe therefore to assume that we have a slightly lower market share in that business as we obviously have just launched that initiative over the past six to eight weeks. One of the things to think about, and at least Rick and I think about this is that assuming that over time markets stabilize and the percentage of total issues as reflected by the graph that shows 42% being FDIC, as that declines we would expect that to have a positive impact on trace overall as banks and other top related entities fund beyond the FDIC guarantee. That should provide significantly more liquidity in the investment grade non FDIC secondary market so we see that as a positive sign over time as I said earlier, assuming some stability in the overall market conditions.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Historically you talked about clearly you've had a very strong presence in the dealer in the United States. You've broadened into the inter-dealer business and management has spoken about the retail opportunity historically, what do you think about that today and what's going on in the retail market? How alluring do you see that opportunity?
Richard McVey: I think it continues to be of interest. As you know retail flows have grown quite significantly in fixed income over the last three or four quarters. We continue to look at ways to participate in the retail business both organically and through acquisitions and quite honestly, even the expansion into the regional dealer community is a step in that direction as those dealers are operating primarily in odd lots on the system and sourcing product from MarketAxess that is then distributed out to retail. So we continue to be interest in expanding our network into new clients segments including the retail space and it is something that we are focused on.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: You touched a little bit on the drivers of the resilience of the revenue capture trends of this quarter but any sense as to the resilience of that as we walk through the year in terms of either customer product mix?
James Rucker: As Kelly mentioned, things that were driving the higher fees was in the new business areas, the regional dealers, the execution service desk as well as a favorable mix and primarily in the high yield business, and all three of those things are sustainable ongoing positive business. So we definitely think that the fee capture trends are sustainable. I guess the only caveat I would put in there, if we got a return to more normal credit markets and we started to see a return of the shorter duration of floating rate note business, that may well come with a reduction fees but the extra revenue we got from getting back that business will be additive.
Operator: There are no questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks.
Richard McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-02-04 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Richard M. McVey - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  T. Kelley Millet - President James N.B. Rucker - Chief Financial Officer Trey Gregory - Head of Marketing and Communications 
Analysts: Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.  
Operator: Welcome to MarketAxess fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now turn the call over to Trey Gregory, Head of Marketing and Communications at MarketAxess. 
Trey Gregory: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess fourth quarter 2008 conference call. For the call this morning, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, Kelly Millet, President, will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then Jim Rucker, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results.   Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s beliefs regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of those risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release that was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website.  Now, I would like to turn the call over to Rick.
Richard M. McVey: Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2008 results. Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.05 versus $0.06 cents in the fourth quarter of 2007. While credit market conditions became progressively worse throughout the year, we have been able to maintain revenue, manage expense, and generate attractive free cash flow.  Specifically, revenues for the fourth quarter were $21.8 million, and for the full year were $93.1 million, just 0.6% below 2007 levels. Expenses were $18.8 million for the quarter, reflecting the benefit of the expense reduction initiatives completed in the third quarter. For the full year, expenses were $80.3 million or 5% above 2007, including the expenses associated with our acquisition of Greenline Financial Technologies.  Other company metrics on investor orders, expansion of dealer participation, and product breadth continue to point to valuable growth of the franchise. Our financial position grew stronger throughout 2008 due to $23.6 million in free cash flow leading to record year end cash balances of $143 million.  As you can see on slide 4, market conditions in the fourth quarter proved to be the most difficult of the year. Benchmark credit spreads as measured by the Credit Suisse LUCI index widened to 541 basis points, up from 359 basis points at the end of the third quarter. Credit spread volatility spiked higher highlighting the extremely difficult trading conditions during the quarter. Market conditions did improve somewhat toward the end of the quarter and December trace volumes were 30% higher than year ago levels including volume from newly issued FDIC-backed bank bonds. Bank funding pressures as measured by the TED spread eased substantially during the quarter. Investors’ sentiment improved and risk taking increased toward the end of the quarter resulting in a more balanced buy-sell ratio on our system. Preliminary numbers for January show that our US high-grade market share remained similar to the fourth quarter average and fee capture trends remained positive. On slide 5 you can see that the MarketAxess network is growing broader and deeper. Investor order count increased by 40% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago demonstrating that investors continue to rely on MarketAxess as a unique channel to source liquidity in the credit markets. Balance sheet constraints among the largest dealers have reduced secondary market liquidity causing investors to broaden their group of dealer counterparties. In order to satisfy investor demand on the trading system, we added 19 new dealers in the second half of 2008. Direct connections to investor order management systems continue to grow rapidly. As you can see from the bottom left hand chart, increasing 48% to 198 at year end. The percentage of trades executed through these direct OMS connections continues to grow as you can see from the bottom right hand chart. Investor engagement on the platform remains strong. We believe that the decline in trading volume on the system is largely due to lower levels of liquidity in credit markets brought on by balance sheet constraints at most large dealers. As a result, we have expanded our market making community and introduced innovative technology to enable investors to find matches to their orders through our market list open order book functionality. With that let me turn it over to Kelley to discuss our new initiatives in more detail.
T. Kelley Millet:  To address the decline in volumes and market share, we executed new initiatives in the second half of 2008 complementary to our core client to do the business. As you can see from the top right hand chart of slide 6, primary dealer holdings are corporate bonds with more than a year maturity has continued to decline. This indicates the impaired secondary market making capabilities of the large dealers and highlights the importance of the new dealers that we brought on to the platform. To enable our new regional dealers to have maximum impact, we have to create the point of connection between them and our institutional investors. We’re more than half way through that process. In October, we introduced innovated new technology that we have called MarketBliss to assist investors in finding matches to their orders. Investors are able to display their orders to the entire MarketAxess trading community including other investors. Effective last week, other investors who had seen one of these public increase had electronically entered an order through a dealer of their choice. Over 18,000 orders were made public in the fourth quarter with a value of approximately $8 billion. As you can see from the chart at bottom right, the number of orders that do not trade on the platform have been growing. Our third initiative is references issue by creating a trading and execution services desk. We seek to find matches for those orders that do not trade as well as execute certain other orders on behalf of clients. The fee passer on these types of trades is higher. In addition, like our DealerAxess business, these trades are transacted on a risk-less principle basis with MarketAxess’ counterparty and settled through a third party clearing firm. Through these initiatives we believe that we’ve taken the right steps to continue to grow our core trading business through challenging market conditions. In addition to the steps to address market challenges, on slide 7, we outlined the growing diversification through growth in technology and data services. Technology and data accounted for 18% of our revenues in the fourth quarter, up from 7% in the fourth quarter of last year. In November we announced the integration of Markit Quotes into the MarketAxess trading platform. Markit Quotes is a real time quote parsing service that extracts indicative over-the-counter prices from electronic messages and is most widely used for CDS data. The integration provides clients with CDS click to trade functionality. The integration with Markit Quotes and take up of the product by clients has been good. We see this as an important step in our overall CDS strategy. We are pleased with the continued growth of Greenline through a very difficult environment with first-line customers in Latin America and the Middle East. Greenline total revenue grew by 64% for the full year 2008 compared to 2007. During the fourth quarter, we continued to grow our BondTicker data product with the launch of our European BondTicker that displayed market standard pricing data with MarketAxess. The average sales number of BondTicker users grew by 28% during the fourth quarter from a year ago highlighting the importance of transparency and quality market data in the current environment. On slide 8, we present our trading volumes and fee per million for the fourth quarter. Our volumes are down compared to a year ago, but the quality amidst the business has been more favorable resulting in a higher fee per million captures. Our variable transaction fee grew to $159 per million in the fourth quarter of this year for $113 in the fourth quarter of 2007. The key contributors to the higher fee capture is in the higher variable fees from the new regional dealers, growth of the high yield business, and the introduction of our trading and execution services business. So, while we’ve experienced the year-over-year decline in volume amidst the difficult market condition, the reduction in commission revenue has been more manageable. Now, let me turn it over to Jim for review of our earnings.
James N. B. Rucker:  Based on slide 9 for our earnings performance, while we’ve not been immune to the current market environment, revenue, earnings, and cash flow have held up well. Total revenue of $21.8 million for the fourth quarter was down just 2% from a year ago with better revenue diversification. As Kelley mentioned earlier, a higher portion of our revenue is now coming from technology in data with our Greenline acquisition being the key contributor to this. Investment income which is included in all other revenue category was down 47% from a year ago due to a reduction in yield on our investments. We have continued to exercise expense discipline, and as a result, net income was up 400,000 from the third quarter and in line with a year ago. On slide 10, we’ve laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes, and fees per million. Commission revenue was down only 12%, cushioned by better fee capture on the 6-monthly distribution fees in US high-grade and Europe. Total variable transaction fees of $159 per million were up 41% from the fourth quarter of 2007. Fees per million were up across all three categories.
 : Employee compensation and benefits was of center revenue was 46%, down from 49% in the third quarter, and in line with the fourth quarter of 2007. Employee headcount as of December 31st was 185 compared to 182 at the end of 2007. Cap-Ex for the full year of 2008 was $4 million. On slide 12, we have our 2009 expense guidance. We currently expect our 2009 full year expenses to be in the range of $77 to $84 million. The most significant factor impacting any expected increase in 2009 expenses over the Q4 2008 run rate will be a result of the trading and execution services business that Kelley spoke of earlier. Most of the expenses for this business will be employee compensation and benefits and will vary based on the growth in revenues. We expect our Cap-Ex expenses for 2009 to be in the range of $4 to $7 million. We expect the diluted share count for the first quarter of 2009 to be in the range of 37.3 million to 37.8 million shares. We expect the tax rate for the full year 2009 to be between 41% and 43%. On slide 13, we highlighted the strength of our balance sheet. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. Free cash flow for 2008 was $23.6 million or three times reported net income and only 3% below the $24.2 million for 2007. Our free cash flow margin for the year was 25%. Cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December 31st were $143 million, up from $124 million at year end 2007 and representing $3.81 per share on a diluted basis. Total shareholders equity as of December 31st was $225 million representing book value on a diluted basis of $6.02. We continue to have no bank debt. Now, let me turn the call back to Rich for some closing comments.
Richard M. McVey:  In conclusion, while credit market conditions were extremely difficult, we feel very good about the expansion of our product capabilities and our trading network during the year. Our revenues held up well, our free cash flow has been strong, and our balance sheet is healthier than ever. We’ve expanded our product offering through new dealers, new services, and innovative new technology solutions. Investor participation on the platform remains strong. We entered 2009 as a leader in providing new electronic trading solutions to improve liquidity in credit markets and we remain confident that open electronic trading will play a bigger role in the future. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). You have a question from the line of Daniel Harris from Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs:  We’ve seen industry cash volumes stabilize and actually move higher here, one of the only asset classes that we’re starting to see year-over-year growth and obviously that was one of the weaker asset classes earlier last year, but what do you guys see as the major drivers to that change recently, how do you see that playing out over the next 6 to 12 months, and is there anything we should be thinking about or looking at outside of the funding cost from the banks or volatility that would help us get a better sense of that?
T. Kelley Millet:  There are two factors I think in addition to the macro sense that liquidity and bank funding has improved slightly from its lows. Our view on trade volumes and market volumes overall is that they’ve been effected by two things; overall it has been the emergence of the very robust new issue calendar that improved in the fourth quarter and certainly really demonstrated large growth in the month of January, and within that context, the importance of the FDIC guarantee bank bonds are a significant part of that as well. So, I think the secondary block trading that occurs around the new issues is they’re free to trade, probably has the biggest impact both in outright corporate as well as those FDIC bonds in pushing volumes up certainly towards the end of the fourth quarter and in January.
Richard M. McVey:  I think, Daniel, there’s been a clear shift in investor sentiment in the corporate bond markets as valuations reach new lows during the fourth quarter and we’ve seen a shift not only in the institutional market for corporate bonds but also in the retail market. So, demand for our corporate bonds has picked up and we think that that sentiment is partly responsible for the increases we’re starting to see in secondary bond trading as well.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs:  And Rick, there’s obviously been a number of rumblings coming out of Washington with regards to CDS trading and potentially an impact on owning the underlying bond in some of the legislation that is being proposed, while obviously we’re probably far from seeing any of that happen, I’d love to get your thoughts on how that would impact the cash market? And just your general views on that type of legislation.
Richard M. McVey:  I think it’s a very tricky dynamic with respect to some of the structural changes that are being proposed from the CDS market, and our belief is that the market will benefit from central clearing, it will benefit from greater transparency, but some of the proposals include no naked positions in OTC derivatives and required underlying cash position we think would radically reduce the amount of trading and activity in the OTC derivates markets, and the end would not help the risk management takes place, it’s a fundamental piece of the derivatives markets. I think today we believe that the regulatory initiatives around central clearing and greater transparency are healthy for the market; we support them, but we would prefer not to see some restructural changes that would reduce the amount of risk taking that takes place in the OTC derivatives markets.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Yes, that sounds like what we’re thinking too. And then lastly, can you put any color around the participation of the new dealers that you guys have added in the past six months, and whether or not that’s a revenue capture or just revenues, and then taking a step further, is there a similar strategy that you can follow in Europe or other geographies in terms of adding a secondary fleet of the regionals or diversity dealers?
T. Kelley Millet: Let me discuss the US regionals and let Rick comment on Europe. We’re pleased with the progress with the regionals. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks as a fully disclosed, commission-based trading system, we have to work very hard with them to connect with the institutional investors on the system, and as I said earlier, that’s about halfway through, but to give you an idea on both the profitability in those trades as well as where we stand in their reports to the system, those regional dealers in the 1 million and under bucket pay a transactional fee, and obviously then there is the variable transaction fee that’s included in all of the electronic trades. So the fees per million in a regional trade are maturely higher than the average fee capture that we see across the blackboard. In terms of the overall performance, I’ll give it to like this. As a group, they are a top seven dealer now on the system in both volume and count. So, as I said, we’re pleased with the progress to date because a lot of focus in improving and maximizing their connectivity with the institutional investors on the system.
Richard M. McVey: I’d just add to that. I think the liquidity has become so challenging and trade sizes have been reduced across the board; the regionals are playing a more important role, especially in the 1 million and under trade category, which is where they have the biggest impact on our system. We do think, Daniel, there’s an opportunity to transport what we’ve done well with the dealer expansion in the US into the European region. We are talking to additional dealers about joining the market access system in Europe currently, and we also think that there’s application for our market list open order book technology in Europe as there has been here in the US, as the secondary market has really moved much more to an investor order matching market as opposed to a deal principal market. So, both of those things that we’ve done well, we think in the third and fourth quarter in the US, we’re working on for Europe as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller from Sidoti & Co.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.: I was just wondering if you could just give us a little color on how we should be thinking about the average fee per million as we’re heading into 2009; obviously, as the regional dealers get up to speed, that would be a benefit, but as we possibly see an improvement in the FRN business, that would obviously weigh on things, and obviously the durational play factors; any thoughts on how we should be looking at that as we go forward?
James N. B. Rucker: As Kelley mentioned in his prepared remarked, there are really three things that have been driving the fees per million higher. One is the growth in business done by the regional dealers, the second is that we’ve been seeing growth in the high-yield business that carries high fees per million both the US and Europe, and the third is the execution and training services that Kelley mentioned. So those three things have been driving the fees per million higher, and we expect the trends in those to continue, but having said that, as you mentioned, if market conditions wouldn’t normalize and we had volume growth particularly in areas like FRNs that carry lower fees per million, that could offset the trend from these other factors, but if that is happening, it would be a good problem.
T. Kelley Millet: I don’t see it highly likely that we would see a real significant improvement in the front-end floater liquidity and a significant or material increase in activity on the system certainly through the first half of the year.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.: Okay, so you think that probably the fourth quarter seems to be a decent benchmark for the next few quarters until we see an improvement in the FRN business.
T. Kelley Millet: Yes, I think we’re going to see a continuation of the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.: Okay, and I think that you guys had made some comments on the market share in January relatively to TRACE data being expected to be somewhere in the range where you guys were in the fourth quarter, I was wondering if that was a correct statement, and obviously, we saw an improvement throughout the fourth quarter in market share; I was wondering if you were anticipating that that would be somewhere near the December levels or towards the beginning of the quarter in October.
T. Kelley Millet: If you look at January share, it’s in line with the average share that we achieved in the fourth quarter. A couple of things that will impact share in the first quarter; one is the prevalence of the FDIC new issuance, that is a different set of both sell side traders as well as buy side investors. We think this is a great opportunity for us. We’re on everyone’s desk. We think we have a better trading protocol than the competition from the buy-back standpoint. So, we’re working very very hard there, but obviously that’s both our enumerator and trace denominator. The second point is the overall new issue market away from the FDIC business has also been quite robust in January, and we would expect it to continue in the first quarter. As you know, in terms of our business model, we typically don’t capture the large block trades that come off of new issues as they’re free to trade. We’re positively correlated to the new issue business as it provides greater liquidity and two-way flows in the market, but that’s typically on a lag basis. So, I think that gives you a little bit of color and insight in terms of where we think we are in terms of share and what the factors are contributing to that.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.: Looking at the range you guys have given for capital expenditures, and obviously it is somewhat wide; what would really influence that to be towards the top or the bottom end of that range?
James N. B. Rucker: As a percentage, our Cap-Ex numbers are not that large on absolute terms, the range is only $3 million, but there are a couple of things that would determine whether we end up at the higher or lower end of that range. One is, we have looked at a couple of technology infrastructure projects for the second half of the year that we’ve not yet decided whether to do them or not, that’s one factor that would impact it; and then the second key determinant will be the level of capitalized software development that will be undertaken during the course of the year. Those are the two factors that will have the most significant impact on whether we end up at the high or the low end of the CapEx range.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.: For the infrastructure projects, would that be something that you would expect would ultimately drive stronger volume or is it just improving the plumbing on the system?
James N. B. Rucker: It’s more improving the plumbing and putting us in a better position to better take care of volumes further down the road.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.: Okay, and can you talk a little bit about the regional dealers impact on the hit rate whether or not we saw an improvement there for the smaller-size trades in the fourth quarter relative to the third as they’ve come up on the system.
T. Kelley Millet: We’ve seen a modest improvement in hit rate and performance in their selective buckets, so to speak, which is a million and under, and there are two reasons for that. One is, their outright winning of the trade where typically we may not have gotten prices back, and secondly is where they provide, in the sense what would be a cover or a third price where a buy side firm may require at least two if not three prices from a best execution to actually execute that trade. So, our mission or objective is to improve the hit rate which then we think will promote greater increase into that side trade bucket and with the higher fee per million obviously drive incremental revenue from those regional dealers. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, we still have a lot of work to do in connecting them with all of our institutional investors, but there are a lot of positive drivers as we continue to grow in that business.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.: Okay, and with regard to the technology fees in the fourth quarter relative to the third, if you can give a little color on the trends you’re seeing there and more specifically I guess with the decision with TWS, the services there, just want to know the ASP model and what you guys are seeing.
T. Kelley Millet: As you know, the dominant contributor to our technology services business is Greenline, and in my prepared remarks, we’re pleased with their performance in difficult market conditions. We saw very strong growth year over year. We would expect growth to continue albeit at a lower percentage rate year over year. You are correct with TWS; historically they were focused on the large broker dealers, in a sense more with that product strategy to focus on connectivity with regional dealers in promoting connectivity across various exchanges, thinner TRACE, etc., and the willingness and ability to offer it outright or on a hosted ASP model. So, we’re pleased with the early signs about that change and its impact on revenue and product license success, but again, if you look at the aggregate number, it will be the effective of focus and success of Greenline that would drive the bulk of that in 2009.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Co.: Okay, and just one last question, with regards to the cash position; where are you guys staying with that now, with your expectations for using that going forward, whether or not there are any acquisition candidates that you’re seeing that look interesting or if it’s just a matter of holding ground right now and continuing to focus on the current opportunities and improving the current platform?
James N. B. Rucker: Just a couple of comments on that. First of all I think having a strong cash balance is a luxury in a difficult market and a position we’re very pleased to have. So, we like the health of our balance sheet and consider it an important part of our business. With respect to the second question on acquisitions; we’re always looking for complementary technology solutions that would expand our services to the institutional trading markets. Having said that, we started the year incredibly excited about the new initiatives that we have going on organically. We have radically expanded the trading connections on the MarketAxess trading system over the last four months with a growth in dealer market makers on the system and the extension to the open order book through market lists. So, we believe that we’re delivering very important solutions to today’s credit markets, and the company’s primary focus is on executing on those initiatives in order to grow our revenues and grow our earnings throughout 2009.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Richard M. McVey: Thank you very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-10-29 08:30:00) =====

Analysts: Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company Howard Chen - Credit Suisse
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, October 29th, 2008. I would now like to turn the call over to Trey Gregory, Head of Marketing and Communications at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Trey Gregory: Thank you. Good morning. For the call this morning, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review highlights for the quarter; Kelley Millet will provide update on trends and businesses; and then Jim Rucker, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial conditions may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of those risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report, Form 10-K for the period year ended December 31st, 2007. I would also direct you to forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release that was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website. I would like now to turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Credit market turbulence reached new heights in the third quarter, including several notable financial institution failures and forced sales. Levels of credit spreads and credit spread volatility continued to soar and a wide range of funding markets seized up. As a result of these events, liquidity in the corporate bond markets has been scarce, traditional market makers have reduced their appetite and trading is being done increasingly on a riskless principle or agency basis. Our earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.04 down from $0.07 a year ago were disappointing. However, revenue of $22.7 million was up slightly from the prior year quarter, benefiting from our acquisition of Greenline. We also took steps during the quarter to trim our expenses, in light of the market conditions, reflecting our continued focus on expense discipline. Cash flow continues to run well in excess of reported earnings. The level of participation on the trading platform remains high, as evidenced by the number of investor clients submitting trade inquiries and the number of live orders submitted. Our dealer network expanded significantly during the quarter, with the addition of 21 new dealers. Direct order management system connections with investors also increased again. Throughout the credit crisis, our trading network has continued to grow broader and deeper. I see the current market conditions as a unique opportunity to introduce new trading solutions that address the current credit environment. In addition, to 21 new dealers on this system, we also introduced an open order book for bid and offer lists, which Kelley will talk more about shortly. We will continue to invest in technology and trading solutions that increase the pool of potential counterparties for credit market participants, in order to rebuild the secondary market liquidity. We believe that the trading model will change for corporate bonds and CDS, and new sources of liquidity will emerge. MarketAxess is in a great position to benefit. The signs of severe stress in the credit markets are evident from the metrics we provide on Slide 4. In the upper left hand corner, high grade corporate bond benchmark spreads gapped out further during the quarter. The benchmark spread on corporate bonds as measured by LUCI index widened significant to 303 basis points at the end of the quarter, up from 214 basis points at the end of the second quarter. Index spreads have spiked further in October. Credit spread volatility in the upper right hand corner has remained extraordinarily high for more than a year, with little sign that it will return to historical norms in the short term. The bank funding spread, the treasuries as shown in the chart on the bottom right of this slide has increased, highlighting the elevated credit risk among financial institutions that has had such significant ramifications throughout the credit markets. Bank funding costs have retreated over the last several weeks. In this environment dealers risk taking abilities are significantly restricted and liquidity in the corporate bond markets is greatly reduced. We do not see a quick resolution to these problems and anticipate a bumpy ride over the next few quarters. While credit events are having an impact on short-term earnings, I believe that the rapidly evolving credit markets present a significant long-term opportunity. On Slide five, we highlight our valuable liquidity and balance sheet assets. Our more than $130 million in cash and securities and our strong free cash flow mean that we have the financial resources to not only ride out the current market turmoil, but also to invest in additional technology and trading solutions that will broaden liquidity and improve transparency in the credit markets. Institutional investor clients are telling us that existing sources of liquidity are inadequate to run their business and they are actively seeking alternative solutions that will help to restore normal functioning of secondary credit markets. I believe that our strong cash balances leading position in corporate bond trading and deep credit markets experience will place MarketAxess at the forefront in creating these alternatives. We are witnessing a shift in credit trading from a principle business to an agency business, a transition that will ultimately favor greater electronic trading. Let me now hand over to Kelly, who will provide more detail regarding some of these initiatives.
Kelley Millet: Thank you, Rick. On Slide six, we have laid out High Grade TRACE and our High Grade market share. High Grade TRACE for the third quarter 2008 was $429 billion down 16% from $513 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Our total US High Grade trading volumes for the third quarter was $27.5 billion down 31% from the third quarter of last year. The overall TRACE volume declines as well as the decrease in average trade size highlights the severe illiquidity in the dealer community, which has continued into October. The market has returned to a traditional voice execution agency model, where investors have enforced back-to-the phone in order to complete their trades. The year-on-year increase in trades of less than $1 million, as a percentage of trades in both count and volume reflects increased retail trading and underscores the importance of our recent dealer addition. The left hand part of the slide seven shows the dramatic decrease in primary dealer holdings of corporate securities. A lack of principle risk taking is the driving force behind the reduction in overall TRACE volume and our market share. Our opportunity is clearly demonstrated on the right hand of the slide. Although our inquiry count is up 21% year-on-year, our trade count was up only 6%. The 32,000 orders that were not filled provide us with an opportunity to deliver other sources of liquidity to complete these trades. Among our initiatives for the third quarter, we added 21 new dealers to the platform. They bring strength and odd lots and could allow us to capture greater share in this high margin business despite market volatility, early results are encouraging. We are in the midst of our on-boarding process and have obtained approximately of our target client commissioning for this new group, leaving significant upside when we get to critical mass. In addition, we introduced market list that display live orders to our entire MarketAxess community. This allows for the clients and the users to see lists in real-time and should promote greater liquidity and flow over the system. Importantly, it also leaves open electronic and hybrid means to more efficiently connect our entire customer base. We also saw continued progress in client connecting their order management systems to us through APIs, highlighting their strong commitment to our platform. Our mass connections increased to 181 at the end of the third quarter from 168 at the end of June. On slide 8, we review our other North American businesses. In CDS we are fully supportive of the move to central clearing. Central clearing services will strengthen market integrity and at the same time mitigate counter-party risk. Greater use of electronic trading will increase transparency, reduce errors, and improve market efficiencies, all consistent with regulatory objectives for the CDS market. In the credit markets, we have unsurpassed connectivity, straight-through processing and client and dealer desktop space. We believe we can play an important role in this market as it evolves. In tech services, Greenline continues to perform well, despite difficult market conditions. Greenline was accretive to earnings once again in the third quarter. Trade West Systems our much smaller acquisition, has been challenged by its licensed model and the current condition of many of its dealer clients. We have, therefore, transformed this business to an ASP model and have focused our sales efforts on regional dealers and data services providers. In our trading solutions business, we continue to seek ways to monetize our technology assets, especially in CDS and in the dealer-broker space. In info services, given the increasing need for transparency and best execution, demand for BondTicker remains high with record logons for the quarter. In addition, we launched European BondTicker in September and preliminary interest looks promising. Finally, we will look to partner with others, pursue new asset classes and seek to broaden and deepen our relationships with new and existing data clients. With that, let me turn it over to Jim for a review of our earnings. Jim?
Jim Bucker: Thank you, Kelley. Please turn to slide nine for our earnings performance. Results for the quarter reflected the challenging market conditions. Earnings per share were $0.04 compared to $0.07 in the third quarter of last year. Revenue for the quarter of $22.7 million was up 2% from a year ago and benefited from another solid quarter from the Greenline business, which is reflected in the technology products and services line. Pretax income for the third quarter was $2.1 million, compared to $3.6 million for the third quarter of 2007. Excluding $1.5 million in charges relating to employee severance and a write down of intangible assets, pre-tax income for the third quarter of 2008 would also have been $3.6 million in line with the third quarter of last year. The effective tax rate was 28% this quarter, compared to 40% in the second quarter. The lower tax rate relative to the second quarter, was due to a higher than anticipated year-to-date pre-tax contribution from our European business. We anticipate that the effective tax rate for the full year will be between 39% and 41%. The 37.4 million diluted share count for the quarter; includes the impact of the second trench of preferred shares and warrants issued in relation to the investment in MarketAxess by TCV on July 14th. On Slide 10, we've laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total trading volume for the quarter of 49 billion was down 35%, compared to the third quarter of 2007, resulting in variable commission revenue of $6.2 million. Overall transaction fees per million were up 26% from the third quarter of last year. US high-grade fees were up 24% at $118 per million, benefiting from the longer maturity and smaller average size of trades over the platform. Distribution fees for the US and European high-grade of $11 million were below Q2 levels, largely as a result of the recent consolidation in the dealer community. We anticipate that our US high-grade distribution fees will be down by a further 600,000 in the fourth quarter. Total commission revenue for the third quarter of $17.2 million was down 9%, compared to the prior year quarter. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Total expenses were 11% above the second quarter of 2007, and include the impact of our acquisitions of Trade West Systems and Greenline. Excluding the impact of expenses related to the acquisitions, our underlying expenses declined 7.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2007. Total expenses include 800,000 in employee severance charges resulted from employees terminated during the quarter. Also included is a 700,000 write-down of the intangible assets recorded in connection with a TWS acquisition, as a result of revised revenue expectations for the business. This write-down represents approximately 75% of the intangible assets related to the TWS acquisition. Employee compensation and benefits, as a percentage of revenue was 49%, compared to 46% in the third quarter of 2007. We expect that full year 2008 expenses will be between $80.5 million and $81.5 million. Employee headcount as of September 30 was 185, compared to 181 in the third quarter of 2007. The 185 headcount number includes 42 staff from the Greenline and TWS acquisitions. On slide 12, we show our strong free cash flow generation. Our free cash flow is well in excess of reported net income and provides a significant cushion in the event that revenue is adversely impacted by further deterioration in the credit markets. For the nine months ended September 30, we generated free cash flow of $14.6 million. This is approximately two and a half times the reported net income of $6 million. Our cash and securities balances of over $130 million strong free cash flow and disciplined expense management have positioned us well to weather the storm in the credit markets, Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick McVey: In conclusion the credit trading environment remains challenging for all market participants. However, MarketAxess is well capitalized, profitable and cash flow positive. The next few quarters may remain uneven, but we believe market forces will increase the demand for central E trading venues and central clearing. We have the financial resources to invest in new solutions that will open up new sources of liquidity and help to improve secondary market conditions. We believe we have the best opportunity ever to become a more central part of the secondary corporate bond and CDS markets. When we look back at this period, we believe we will see the current environment as a catalyst for change in credit markets that benefits open E trading, transparency and central clearing. The rewards for companies that are able to successfully invest and navigate through the current cycle will be high. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Daniel Harris from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Good morning, guys.
Rick McVey:  Good morning, Daniel.
Kelley Millet: Good morning, Daniel.
Jim Rucker: Good morning, Daniel.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Rick you talked about the bank funding costs coming down over the past few weeks and we saw that in the charts you provided and it looks like we have actually seen industry volumes have been stabilizing through October and you are actually moving up through the trends that we have seen recently. So, when you think about funding costs and volatility in the market and the variety of spreads you look at, what do you see as the most important direct impact on cash bond trading as it relates to what you are seeing in TRACE and certainly on your platform?
Rick McVey: I think, Daniel, there are a variety of factors. But certainly the dealer funding costs and the dealer balance sheet capacity have been important variables over the last three or four quarters. And I think it is important that it is those funding markets start to free up and funding costs come down, you should start to see risk appetite improve. I think also, as markets start to stabilize, we should see better flows from traditional investors back into credit. It is too early to say that trend has started yet, but certainly institutional investors starting to come back into the market and take advantage of the wider spreads, it would be a signal of the beginning of the turnaround in the credit market. It should help TRACE volume to rebound and grow.
Kelley Millet: Daniel, its Kelley. We have not yet seen, although we have had a couple of decent days or more normalized days of consistent return to sort of hit rates to more normalized levels that would be a better reflection of the dealer's willingness to take risk. Secondly, I think as you're well aware the new issue market really hasn't opened yet. We're beginning to see signs of that. I think that will be another important sign as dealers are underwriting and taking secondary positions against those new issues, as principal. Then the other I think is as Rick kind of alluded to, a more even two-way flow. Historically our flow on our system has been reasonably balanced between bid and offer. It is very much skewed to bids currently, as the buy-side is looking for any sort of liquidity in the marketplace. So I would look at those three factors as well.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. Just watching, I know that there are some days that are better and worst than others but with the volumes up closer to 7.6 this month versus what we've seen recently, it certainly seems like things were getting a little bit better. Just shifting a little bit over to Europe, the second quarter had bounced up a little bit, and the third quarter similar to the US has been very, very challenging. Is the European market any different than what we're seeing here, especially, given the different countries and the different regulations? Or when you see the US market and the various factors that you're tracking get better, should we be thinking that the European volumes will improve as well or is there more of a limiting factor over there?
Rick McVey: I think that there are more similarities than differences, and I think the European credit markets have been impacted by the same factors as the US credit markets, so if funding conditions improve in the new issue calendar starts to reopen, we would also expect European volumes to rebound. As we've stated in the past, there is a higher percentage of bank and finance paper in Europe than there is in the US and that paper, as you know, Daniel, has been the most distressed and the most volatile. So the European markets arguably could have been impacted more by the crisis among the financial institutions, although it is very difficult to be too scientific about that, because of the lack of any central trade tape or TRACE like reporting mechanism in the European markets today.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Just following up on that, then Rick this Euro BondTicker that you talked about during the call, what is that product that you're going to be launching? Just looking at what you've done on that data side before, 1.4 billion or so of quarter, how would you characterize that opportunity?
Rick McVey: I think similar to the US BondTicker, we're taking advantage of existing sources of data which come from private sources and dealer contributions in Europe, more so than they do from a regulatory trade tape. We're enhancing the sources of data by providing institutional analytics around those spreads and historical database and relationships in credit markets. So we're excited about that launch. The data product will be integrated into the trading system in Europe as it has been in the US to help the market with real-time price transparency around corporate bond prices.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Okay. But it's not going to be like a central tape?
Rick McVey: That's correct.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Just going back to the new dealers that you guys added throughout the course of the quarter, the number that you added was much higher than I think Kelley that you had intimated last quarter. Now I'll take that as a positive. But on the regional's that you've added or the 21 that you guys have talked about, does that represent the great majority of the regional's that you were hoping for, or are there still opportunities out there? I know that they're not all signed up with clients yet, so the impact hasn't been felt. But, should we expect that dealer count would increase at all?
Kelley Millet: I think the vast majority of the dealers that we are expecting are part of this 21 that we announced. There certainly could be a handful of others, but I think we feel very good about the critical mass that we are seeing. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of commissioning, as a group these dealers are only seeing about 45% of our total increase, i.e. they are commissioned with the bulk of the key clients, and that the process is ongoing and ongoing aggressively. That's sort of as compared to approximately 85% of the increase, that an average dealer would typically see an average top 10 dealer. So to date, despite market volatility, we see this group as a whole performing as a top 10 dealer on the system. We generally believe, as we complete the on-boarding process, and get any sort of market stability, that as a whole this group can perform as a top five dealer on the system. Keeping in mind that their principal focus and almost exclusive focus is on odd-lot, given the significantly greater profitability on a dollars per million in the odd-lot sector, we think that this can be a very important addition to both liquidity on the system and obviously revenues.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that's great, Kelley. I appreciate that. This is just more of a theoretical and the last one from me. The stocks obviously, similar to a lot of your peers in the sector have been over a lot of pressure over the last year, probably down the levels that I don't think any of us thought about 12 months ago. But you haven’t implemented another repurchase here; at least you haven’t announced one. You have a very healthy balance sheet. How should we be thinking about the fact that, you've made a number of acquisitions, you have a lot of cash, and yet you're not repurchasing shares? How do you explain that out to the market? Then that's all for me, guys, thanks.
Jim Rucker: Hey Daniel, this is Jim. The way we think about it is that in the current constraint funding markets, such as the ones we're currently facing, we place greater emphasis on having strong cash balances. So we are pleased to have those balances, and it allows us to pursue the new solutions to address the current credit environment that Kelley and Rick spoke about earlier. So at the moment, our focus is on pursuing those new solutions and we have higher hopes in terms of the use of the cash balances than other potential uses.
Rick McVey: I think if the funding costs do continue to move down and smaller companies like us have access to them, and the spread returns to some normal relationship between potential funding costs and the return on our portfolio, I'm sure that our board will revisit the opportunity to look at buybacks at this time. This is an environment though, that we're very please to have the strong balance sheet that we have. Other companies are not as fortunate, and we believe it allows us to continue to focus and grow our business, and not be worried about the cash position of the company. So we are cash flow positive, and we're very pleased to have the strength of the balance sheet that we do through this environment.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot.
Jim Rucker: Thanks, Daniel.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Hi, guys. This is actually Joe Heary. How are you?
Rick McVey: Good morning, Joe. Good.
Kelley Millet: Hi, Joe.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: I guess, this is a quick follow-up on the new dealers. When you are saying that you would expect them to be equivalent to a top 10 dealer you are saying in terms of the amount of balance sheet that they bring to the equation once they are fully commissioned?
Kelley Millet: It is actually sort of a measure on average of the amount of business they win over the platform.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay.
Kelley Millet: Right. So right now they are really functioning as a group as sort of a top 10 dealer. And then once we complete the bulk of the permissioning, as I spoke about earlier we think it is highly probable that they will function more in line with a top five dealer. Just to give you a couple of examples, just for some numbers. I mean and the average top 10 dealer probably wins about 7% of the volume over the platform and an average top five dealer does about 10% of the volume.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: So, this is more with respect to the trade count on your platform as opposed to the amount of available balance sheet out there to support activity?
Kelley Millet: I think that's the most specific measure. But I can’t say that and I'm not going to make a blanket statement, but a lot of these dealers were not faced with the same degree of challenge shall we say around sub-prime mortgage assets and other structured products. So, it appears, at least, over this initial process have been at times able to be more aggressive than the larger institutional dealers, who have reduced holdings of corporate securities of the balance sheet, have reduced risks appetite overall for corporate securities. So, I think it's the combination for some of the stronger balance sheet and then wanting to take advantage of an opportunity, where they feel that in this environment they can take share from the traditionally larger dealers.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Are you at liberty to say, how much collectively in terms of balance sheet they sort of fill in terms of the hole created by the leveraging effect on the large dealer size?
Rick McVey: I think it is less of a balance sheet capacity issue as much as it is. They are providing an important service to institutional investors through this credit event in smaller trade sizes because the regionals tend to operator at the seam between small institutional order flow and retail trading business. All signs point to retail trading and fixed income being up. When you look at the increase in odd lots in corporate bonds and the increase in activity in the municipal bond sector, it would appear that retail trading is on the rise. So, as a result I think the regional dealers have a viable business model, where they can operate with small institutional orders and distribute out through their retail channels. That is increasing the available liquidity on our platform to institutional investors for smaller trade sizes.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Right. Then you guys earlier mentioned that your pricing plan for the new dealers is entirely variable but that you would reconsider or evaluate it towards the end of the year, has your thinking changed at all in that regard?
Trey Gregory:  We will look selectively, depending upon the performance of the dealers within that group, whether it makes sense for some combination of a fixed license fee for that handful of dealers and a transactional fee that would be somewhat lower than that majority group who pays no fixed license fee, but rather pays a significantly higher transactional fee per trade. And I think it would be a function of, overall performance and as a handful of these, "regionals" begin to perform very, very well individually, they begin to see the merits of a fixed license fee and they evaluate their sort of overall cost per million for their execution. So we feel very good about having a number of different alternatives as we look at our dealers, in terms of potential portfolio of pricing plans. They try to look at those that prefer a fully fixed license fee for the year. Those that may prefer something that is a combination of a fixed license fee, and a transactional fee, and those given their business model who really would seek and benefit best from their own strategy to be fully a transactional model. So we obviously are going to have to be flexible in this environment, but feel good about that opportunity to be flexible.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Just switching gears a little bit to the technology services, what percentage of the revenues at this point are recurring? Trey, I know in the past you said about 15% was maintenance fees, but that should build sort of over time. Then as a second question with respect to this, what's the pipeline like? Are you seeing any adverse impact as technology budgets start to come under pressure, with regard to the sales cycle or the pipeline?
Trey Gregory: In terms of the pipeline, the pipeline has continued to grow, obviously, taking into account quarterly sales, as well as the fact that the variables or factors as to how we calculate that pipeline has not changed since acquisition. So, I think that's very good news. Keep in mind, also, the pipeline for Greenline is more diverse, away from the credit markets into the exchange community, and asset classes like equities, FX, futures and the rest, is also more diverse geographically, with presence not only in the US and London, but in Asia, Brazil and Dubai. So we feel good about that. Clearly what we're watching in the fourth quarter is what I call average days to close. We haven't seen a significant change to that, but obviously in this market environment with tight purse strings that that's something very important. If I look at, for example, our quarterly results, without getting too specific on the background, we're looking at about 25% to 30% now that we believe are more sort of consistent repeatable revenues, which can be obviously maintenance, a rental versus a licensed model, and certain elements of our pro-services, professional services business that is highly probable to be maintained through quarters, depending on the length of those assignments. So these are what I would call repeatable revenue as a percentage of overall revenue is growing, and certainly that was one of Rick's pushes to all of us as we acquired Greenline to help transform a little bit more consistent repeatable revenue as part of the overall revenue mix.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay, great. Just a last question on the expense side, taking a quick look at the guidance you gave. It looks like you're saying the fourth quarter would be $19 million to $20 million in expenses. That's an increase of about $2 million to $3 million, relative to the $17.2 million that you referred to as sort of the core expense run rate in the third quarter. I was wondering, what would be driving that increase. Is the 17 sort of a way to think about what a good core run rate would be as we head into next year, or is there something else we need to be factoring in?
Jim Rucker: Joe, the midpoint as you say for the guidance, for the fourth quarter is about $19.7 million. Now that's about $1 million down from our total expenses, which obviously includes expenses from the acquisitions as well, in the third quarter. So the guidance clearly anticipates lower expenses in the fourth quarter than we had in the third quarter, and I think in my prepared remarks I did talk, for instance, about employee severance that we took in the third quarter that would lead to lower expenses as we move into the fourth quarter.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay. But I guess the question is more like if you had 17.2 million --
Rick McVey: Joe, I think the 17.2 does not include the new expenses from our acquisition.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: So you mean recurring stuff like D&A and other factors?
Rick McVey: I think we gave the 17.2 number that you're referencing as a way to compare the core operating expenses from the most recent quarter with the third quarter of last year. That was prior to the time we made the new acquisitions. So the run rate that Jim mentioned that we're targeting for the fourth quarter includes the expenses associated with the acquisitions, and it would reflect a decrease sequentially from the expenses that we had in the past quarter.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay, great. I think that 's it. Thanks, guys.
Rick McVey: Thank you.
Jim Rucker: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller from Sidoti & Company. Please proceed.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Hi, good morning.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Hugh.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company:  I was wondering if you could touch base a little bit more and add some color on the TWS decision to switch to an ASP model and what's been happening with their business line and some of the challenges you see and how you are looking to over come those.
Rick McVey:  The original model for TWS, its end consumer which effectively were some, they brought us some 28 in a sense plug-in adaptors, were very large broker-dealers. Those broker-dealers have dramatically reduced their spending over the past four months, if not the last six months. So as we evaluated that model, and we evaluated that client base; we began too see that with the addition of 21 new dealers to the platform. As we expanded our data product across a number of different fronts, we saw the need for connectivity grow between and among the regional dealers and multiple electronic trading platforms, and these data service providers were consumers across various sources of data. But the feedback was that a hosted ASP model, resulting in a rental stream as opposed to an up-front license stream was going to be the preferable sale for the likes of the regional dealers and these added companies. After what was a poor second quarter, we saw some real traction as we transformed that model into the third quarter. In addition, TWS serves two other functions. They work very closely with us internally in providing electronic connectivity for things such as TRACE gateways and work with our BondTicker products in London. They also provide a source and a less expensive source of high class technology assets in people in Salt Lake vis-à-vis, New York. So they can also be a part of our near-sourcing strategy going forward.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Okay. Great color there. I guess obviously you guys have had tremendous success adding the regional and diversity dealers and the focus there is on the odd lot trades. Any thoughts there on whether or none, there is the potential to allow them to trade larger size transactions? Or is that really not something that you guys are comfortable with any time in the near future?
Jim Rucker: We have to be cognizant and respectful of the fixed licensed fees that our large dealers do pay. The way in which we think about the value that the system provides is the disclosed nature of inquiry from our 600-plus strong clients in the US, for example, as well as the STP and connectivity and efficiency that the system provides. So, the quid pro quo of allowing any “regional dealer” to see greater than a million in size, has to be based on their performance in that under a million in size and their potential willingness to pay a fixed license fee as well. So, in my mind, if there is that ability it would be based on both performance as well as the willingness to pay a fixed license fee and I think that would be fair as we try to balance fairness across all of our dealer constituents, but recognizing we have to provide greater sources of liquidity to the buy size.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Okay. I wonder if you could touch upon what you guys are seeing out there with regards to acquisitions, obviously evaluations have improved dramatically here. But any areas that you guys are looking at that you see as opportunities to really grow the business, any color on that would be great?
Jim Rucker: I think that our acquisition focus remains largely the same. We are pleased with the growing connectivity assets that we have as a company. There continued to be some interesting opportunities in the E trading space. As we mentioned earlier demand for quality and real-time credit data continues to grow. Having said that, in the near term we are mostly focused on our organic opportunities because the transformation that we see going on in credit markets. We are very excited about the changes that are taking place on our platform for corporate bonds and the changes that are likely to take place industry wide in CDS trading and clearing. So, our focus on the near term is on maximizing the opportunity in the organic business. But as always we are interested in acquisitions that would allow us to broaden and diversify our sources of revenue.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Okay. Great. Obviously you guys have mentioned that the tax rate implied for 2008 in the 39% to 41% area. But can you talk about 2009, I mean, is it more likely that we will probably see they are heading towards roughly 43% next year?
Jim Rucker: I think at this point Hugh, it is difficult to be that clear on it but I think, for the full year '08, the expectation is for tax rate around 40%, I gave the range of 39% to 41%. I don't see any particular reason why at this point it would be too different in '09 to the full year of '08.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Have you updated us at all on the CapEx guidance? I didn't notice anything there, but any update on that for this year, and any thoughts for next year on that?
Jim Rucker: No update on the CapEx guidance for this year, so in line with previous expectations. I would expect that, we wouldn't update '09 CapEx until our first quarter call.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Okay. Thank you.
Jim Rucker: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Hi, everyone.
Jim Rucker: Good morning, Howard.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Howard.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: First, just a broader question for Rick and/or Kelley, in the past few years the credit asset class has seen growth in the derivatives volume in CDS outpaced that of the high rate bonds. As you hit the road and speed the clients, is there any qualitative color, that we might be seeing that reversed a bit in the near term given increased worries about counter-party risk, et cetera. Are you hearing any of that from clients?
Rick McVey: I think it is too early to tell. I do think that credit investing is returning to more traditional securities, and we have seen in past cycles when credit spreads increased significantly, as they have over the past four quarters, once you start to see stabilization, and turning point typically, institutional investors will commit more capital to the asset class and start to come back in primarily through corporate bonds. I think you're right in CDS the market is suffering because of the counter-party concerns in the market today, and the deleveraging that is taking place among hedge funds in particular. I think that can only be addressed if the market structure becomes more sound through the move to central clearing and central trading venues. So we see that as an opportunity for us going forward that would be different than in the past even in what might be a smaller market for CDS in terms of total trading.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Okay. Great. And then, Jim, apologies if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but can you just touch on where and how you're investing the cash, what you have today? I know you've had some I believe auction rate securities exposure in the past. Could you just give an update there on how things stand?
Jim Rucker: Our cash is all invested either in strongly-rated money market funds, or highly-rated municipal securities of pretty short maturities, less than two years. So, the portfolio is very strong. In terms of the auction rate securities, as of quarter-end we have $7.7 million in auction rate securities. One of those for a value of $1 million is since redeemed and we have also been advised by the investment manager that manages the remaining $6.7 million, that they will purchase these back from us at par during the fourth quarter. So we basically will be out of all of the auction rate securities by the end of the fourth quarter, and our cash portfolio is invested in very strong assets.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks so much, everyone.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Howard.
Operator: You have no questions at this time, sir, and I would now like to turn the call over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-21 08:30:00) =====
Executives:  Stephen Davidson - Head of Investor Relations Richard M. McVey - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  T. Kelley Millet - President James N.B. Rucker - Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts:  Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company Howard Chen - Credit Suisse
Operator: Welcome to MarketAxess second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess.
Stephen Davidson:  For the call this morning, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter. Kelly Millet, President, will provide an update on trends in our businesses. And then Jim Rucker, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results.  Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release that was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick.
Richard M. McVey:  I am pleased to share our solid second quarter results with you today that were achieved in spite of tumultuous credit market conditions. Importantly, we continue to broaden and strengthen our franchise to enhance our long-term potential for our shareholders.  In the second quarter, we delivered record revenue of $25.6 million with EPS of $0.08 versus the prior year period of $0.10. While overall expenses were up 8.4%, expenses excluding acquisitions were down 4.9% from the year ago period. Investor demand for our electronic solutions continue to build with US high-grade inquiry count of 15% and 168 live investor order management system connections at the end of the quarter, up over 50% from 110 connections one year ago. We attracted a new strategic investor with Technology Crossover Ventures purchase of a minority stake in MarketAxess in early June. TCV’s $35 million investment, combined with our continued strong operating cash flow, greatly enhances our capital flexibility. Bob Trudeau from TCV has also joined our Board and is actively contributing to our strategic discussions.  And lastly, we registered $2.7 million in technology, product and service revenue, including the first full quarter contribution from our acquisition of Greenline Financial Technologies. We are pleased with both the improvement in short-term results and the expansion of our business and shareholder base accomplished during the quarter.  Dealers continue to face balance sheet and credit risk constraints reducing their ability to commit capital to clients in the market-making capacity. This decline in dealer liquidity is having a negative impact on overall credit market trading volumes. Kelly will talk shortly about some of our plans to expand the pool of liquidity providers on our system. We will continue to take steps to expand our client base, increase our sources of liquidity and further enhance our technology in order to drive network benefits for our dealer and investor clients.  On slide four, we provide an update on factors that are driving trading activity in our core market. While we have seen short periods of improved liquidity over the past year, clear signs of stress in the financial market remain. In the upper left-hand corner, high-grade corporate bond benchmark spreads remain at their widest levels in a decade. Credit spread volatility, in the upper right hand corner, has remained extraordinarily high over four full quarters straining the risk management capacity of even the most sophisticated institutional players. The yield curve remains steep and bank funding spreads to treasuries are stubbornly high. This picture of sharply elevated credit risk in the system combined with dealer balance sheet constraints has caused a dramatic reduction in market liquidity. We continue to believe that a normalization of credit spread volatility is needed in order to increase overall corporate bond training volumes.  On slide five, we highlight recent transactions which we believe improve our long-term prospects and our short-term flexibility. First, we have recently completed two acquisitions, TWS and Greenline, consistent with our stated strategy of complementing our organic growth opportunities with strategic acquisitions that expand our technology services business, enhance our client connectivity offering and extend our client base.  Total cash consideration for these acquisitions was $38.1 million. And in the second quarter, we attracted a new strategic investor in Technology Crossover Ventures with their purchase of approximately 9% minority stake in MarketAxess for $35 million. The TCV investment rebuilds our cash position to pre-acquisition levels and provides significant flexibility for other acquisitions or share repurchase programs. We implemented the shareholder rights plan simultaneously with the closing of the TCV transaction. We believe this was a prudent step to protect our shareholders in light of some of the recent stock price activity in MarketAxess. This plan in no way restricts our ability to consider transactions that appropriately reward our shareholders, but it does deter potential hostile acquirers from accumulating stock at a time when we believe shares are undervalued.  We remain confident in our long-term opportunity and we believe we are taking appropriate steps to protect our shareholders through an extremely difficult period in the market. With that, let me turn it over to Kelly to discuss trends in our business. 
T. Kelley Millet:  On slide six, we show the long-term trend in FINRA TRACE. Our respective shares provide more detail in the contribution of fixed and floating-rate bond trading to our estimated share of trades. Estimated industry FRN volumes went from $83 billion in the second quarter of last year to $51 billion in this year’s second quarter, a decline of 39%. MarketAxess headline volumes fell further as dealers are wary of committing any capital to the upper end business. While upper end trading over MarketAxess represented 3.7% of our share in the second quarter last year. Upper ends were only 0.6% of our share in the second quarter of 2008. Importantly, our share of the fixed rate business has seen only a slight decline. Our share of the higher fee per million business was 9.4% in June of this year, which was the highest fixed rate monthly share registered since June of 2007, which was a record at 9.6%.  A reminder on estimated shares: Estimated market share for US high businesses can register large short-term swings due to potential shifts and the makeup of trading activity between our client to dealer, dealer to dealer and retail market segments.  Lastly, our estimate of July share is that it will be below June but above the year-to-date monthly average.  On slide seven, we show the underlying strength of our client franchise. Institutional investor demand for our platform is stronger than ever. The number of US high-grade client inquiries in the US high-grade platform increased from 132,000 in the first half of 2006 to 179,000 in the first half of the year. The strong growth rates we have seen are being driven by the highly profitable fixed-rate business which saw a sequential fixed-rate inquiry count increases of 21% and 15% respectively since 2006.  Our OMS-driven trade count continues to grow. Trades executed on the platform that originated from a client on this system have increased from 14,000 in the first half of 2006 to 51,000 in the first half of 2008. We have significantly increased the number and quality of clients connecting into us since 2006. As we embed ourselves into client workflows, our system becomes sticky and raises competitive barriers to entry.  In our other product areas, we are also seeing strong investor demand with double digit growth in inquiry counts and inquiry volumes in our emerging markets and high yield product areas. These two products continue to be areas of focus for us given the significant market opportunity and revenue potential. In Europe, while trading volumes are down 50% year over year, we have seen a strengthening of the business with trading volumes up 46% and revenues up 12% from the first quarter of 2008. Current volatile market conditions have created demand for our online and technology solutions, but dampened appetite for client-to-dealer CES trading and electronic dealer-to-dealer activity under DealerAxess. We continue to work closely with our customers on different fee and protocol plans to help move these businesses forward.  Slide eight demonstrates the opportunity to expand dealer liquidity on the platform to drive new revenue. The under $1 million trade size bucket of trades represents approximately 90% of the trade tickets and 10% of the total volume. Within this segment of the market, our fixed-rate inquiry volume continues to grow but given dealer risk aversion and lack of balance sheet, our hit ratio declined from 77.7% in the first half of last year to 65% in the first half of 2008. While this segment only makes up approximately 10% of TRACE by volume, it is very attractive from a revenue perspective. The average variable transaction fees earned are significantly above the average variable fees for US high-grade overall. We are not waiting for markets to rebound but are actively looking at ways to improve our hit ratio, drive increased share and generate new revenue in this market segment. So, here’s what we’re doing: First, we are in the process of expanding our dealer group by adding regional and diversity dealers to provide liquidity in the other $1 million trade sizes in both high grade and high yield.  Second, we are working with our existing dealer group so they are fully engaged in responding to the strong inquiry both through API and auto quoting capabilities. We expect this new dealer initiative to improve dealer liquidity which should therefore have a beneficial impact on hit ratio, market share and revenue. Lastly, on slide nine let me discuss Greenline. Greenline develops software solutions that include a full suite of FIX message testing, monitoring and management support tools designed to ensure reliable, high volume throughput of critical transaction messages. And it also has a professional services business and capability that provides clients with custom system development and proprietary software solutions. Based on [TAB[ Group estimates by the end of 2009, there are expected to be more than 60,000 end users of FIX, up from approximately 1,400 at the end of 2005. As a market leader in FIX support software, Greenline has been and will continue to benefit from this growth.  With Greenline, we’ve enhanced our competitive position within fixed income as the market evolves to a fixed-base protocol to trade-related communications. And we have diversified our client base away from dealers and large fund managers to include, for example, exchanges while growing our nine US customer base in new regions such as Asia and the Middle East. We are pleased with the first full quarter contribution from Greenline. Based on the quarter results, we see an acceleration of revenue growth rates. Greenline was accretive to earnings during the quarter including the amortization of intangibles and funding costs. Now, I’d like to turn it to Jim for a review of the financial results. 
James N.B. Rucker:  Please turn to Slide 10 for our earnings performance. Our second quarter results include the first full quarter from our acquisition of Greenline Financial Technologies. Record revenue for the quarter of $25.6 million was $300,000, or 1% above the second quarter 2007 and $2.7 million, or 12% above the first quarter of 2008. Pretax margins of 19% for the quarter were below the 24% margins recorded in the second quarter of 2007 but above the 13% in the first quarter 2008. Earnings per share of $0.08 were only $0.02 below the prior year’s second quarter and $0.03 above the first quarter of 2008. We feel very good about it as a result given the adverse credit market conditions over the past year. The effective tax rate was 40% this quarter, in line with the 41% rate in the prior year second quarter but well below the 46% rate reported in the first quarter of 2008. The significant decline in the tax rate relative to the first quarter was due to a higher pre-tax contribution from our European business and higher tax exempt investment income. We anticipate that the effective tax rate for the full year will be between 42% to 44%.  A quick note regarding the share count. The 34.8 million diluted share count for the quarter includes the impact of the first trench of preferred shares and warrants issued in relation to the investment in MarketAxess on June 3 by TCV. We estimate that the share count for Q3 will be approximately 37.5 million shares, including the impact of the final trench of TCV’s investment which occurred on July 14.  On Slide 11, we’ve laid out trading volumes in fees per million. Total trading volume for the quarter of $70 billion was down 37% compared to the second quarter of 2007, with the largest percentage decline being in our European business. However, compared to the first quarter of 2008, total trading volume was up 8%. While we’re disappointed with the volume trends versus the prior year period, we’re happy with the quality of business being executed over the platform.  In US high-grade, we have retained the high-end margin longer duration business and as a result, variable transaction fees this quarter were up $119 per million, up 47% from the $81 per million in the second quarter of 2007. A decrease in other volume compared to Q2 2007 was primarily due to decreases in CVS and agency volumes. As agency and CVS transactions incur lower fees per million than some of the other products in this category, the average fee per million increased from $123 to $160.  Slide 12 provides the revenue detail. Let me give some highlights. Compared to the year ago quarter, technology products and services revenue increased to $2.7 million, largely as a result of the Greenline acquisition. And European high-grade commissions were up by $700,000 as a result of the new European fee plan which was introduced in June of last year. Offsetting these were the lack of minimum fees from our US high-grade DealerAxess dealer-to-dealer business, as well as, a reduction in investment income as a result of lower average investment balances during the quarter following the Greenline acquisition and a decline in interest rates.  Investment income is reflected in all the other revenue lines. It’s interesting to note that in spite of the extreme market conditions, our total revenue for the first half of this year of $48.6 million was only 1% below revenue for the first half of 2007. As a result of the recent consolidation in the dealer community, we anticipate that our US and European high-grade distribution fees will be down by approximately $300,000 and $100,000 respectively in the third quarter.  Slide 13 provides you with the expense detail. Total expenses were 8% above the second quarter of 2007 and included the impact of our acquisitions of Trade Ware Systems and Greenline. Excluding the impact of expenses related to the TWS and Greenline acquisitions our underlying expenses declined 5% when compared to the second quarter of 2007 reflecting our continued expense discipline. The 5% decline in our underlying expenses is the result of lower employee incentive compensation and depreciation and amortization, partly offset by higher professional and consulting fees and stock compensation. Employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenue was 45%, up from 44% in the second quarter of 2007 but down from 48% in the first quarter of 2008. Based on our first half expenses we would expect the full year 2008 expenses will be at the midpoint of our previous guidance range of $81 million to $84 million.  Employee headcount as of June 30 was 200 compared to 174 in the second quarter of 2007. The 200 headcount number includes an additional 35 staff from the Greenline and TWS acquisitions.  On Slide 14, we have the summary balance sheet data. Our cash, cash equivalents and securities balances as of June 30 were $118 million. The increase in the cash from the first quarter was due to TCV’s purchase of preferred stock. The $118 million does not include net proceeds of $6.8 million from the closing of the final trench of the TCV purchase on July 14.  Book value on a diluted basis as of June 30 based on the weighted average shares outstanding adjusted to show the full effect of the preferred stock issuance during the quarter was $5.75 per share. Cash and securities on the balance sheet represent $3.23 per share and deferred tax assets represent another $1.02 per share. Our free cash flow continues to be well in excess of reported net income. I expect our free cash flow generation for the full year to be more than two times reported net income.  Now, let me pass the call back to Rick for concluding remarks. 
Richard M. McVey:  In conclusion, we’re very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter in light of what continues to be a brutal environment for credit trading. We operate in large OTC markets where our technology solutions are in high demand and electronic trading is still in its infancy. Our competitive position remains strong with a dominant share of the US institutional client and dealer electronic credit market and growing barriers to entry.  The strength and depth of our product continues to expand with more dealer and investor clients choosing to connect their trading systems to MarketAxess increasing customer order flow. With our Greenline acquisition and our growing technology products and services business, we are broadening our relationships into both new electronic trading markets and broader technology solutions and this quarter’s results show an acceleration in growth rates. Lastly, we believe that our new dealer initiative will help increase liquidity on the platform, return hit rates to more normal levels and help to grow revenues and market share. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: I just wanted to follow up with you on the initiative to attract the regional brokers and the smaller brokers to the platform. How do you think about these people in terms of pricing plan? Should we be thinking about them the same way that you have the large guys where you’ll have a fixed fee for them on a monthly basis? Or given their size and probably the different way that they trade, would you have something different in mind?
T. Kelley Millet:  First, just to repeat, they will be limited in responding in terms of increased size to under $1 million and acknowledging your perspective, a number of these regionals are relatively small and some of them specialize in parts of either the high-grade business or high-yield business. So, our initial approach subject to review at year-end will be transactional-based fees as opposed to material-fixed licenses at this point. That being said, as I said in my prepared remarks the average fee for this business will be significantly greater than the average dollars per million in the overall US high-grade business. 
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: You got about 30 large brokers. How many of these smaller and regional brokers are there out there that are actually meaningful participants in the bond market? My guess is there are a lot of regionals.
T. Kelley Millet:  There are a lot of regionals and obviously they’ve been a bit more important over the last year as the large dealers have probably been more negatively impacted by issues around balance sheet and risk. If I had to give a broad range of the kind of portfolio of regionals and diversity firms that we think are available, I think in the regionals it would perhaps be mid-teens and in the diversities, it would be high single numbers. That being said, I think for the initial entry into the marketplace, we hope to have 6-8 regionals and something in the order of 4-6 diversity firms as we kick it off. 
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: And can you talk a little bit more about the Greenline and TWS impact on the technology line? Are those revenues more lumpy? Are they contract-based and stable? How do you think about new sales processes? Is it a long process to get something done or is it something that can happen within a couple of weeks of meeting somebody?
T. Kelley Millet:  If you look at the three legs of our tech services business, obviously, the Greenline business is the largest of the three. The other two being our connectivity solutions, which is anchored by our TWS acquisition and our organic training solutions, which is our work directly with principally dealers and IDBs in terms of providing technology solution.  Within the Greenline company, there are really principally three sources of revenue. One is the license sale itself. The second is ongoing maintenance and the third is professional services. In terms of the life cycle of a software license sale, it’s not typically a matter of weeks but typically anywhere from, let’s say a 10-12 week process. It’s typically the first call, the proof of contract and then the vetting through the technology hurdles within the direct customer.  We’ve been pleased that we’ve only seen a modest impact in terms of market conditions on the lengthening of that sales cycle. And I think a big part of that is their focus client base, as I said earlier, is a way for the large dealers and asset managers and more towards the exchanges and non-US firms who focus more on the latency issues and are not as concentrated in the credit market. 
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: So, based on those three things: the licensing, maintenance and professional services, then it sounds to me like within that mix then that should stabilize revenues. Always tough to say what a run rate would be but not right from 2.7 to 1 to 4, right?
T. Kelley Millet:  Well, we certainly hope so. There is a maintenance level and if you talk to other people in the software business, it tends to be 15% to 25% of revenues on an annual basis. We do think the combination of maintenance and some core level of professional services can give us some consistency of earnings but, obviously, there’s still a sales cycle in terms of either up selling to existing clients or new clients with the software licensing. 
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then on the numbers from this quarter, was there any one-time sale in there? You closed a couple of things this quarter that you wouldn’t have last quarter.
T. Kelley Millet:  I see nothing in the numbers this quarter that are unusual in terms of looking back on Greenline’s history, in terms of to your point, concentrated sales or one off sort of things that are not part of the core trend and core part of the business. 
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Jim, on the share count on the diluted side, can you sort of walk me through the progression, say, over the last quarter or two from the different acquisitions you’ve made plus the shares you’ve issued leading up to the guidance you provided for the third quarter?
James N.B. Rucker:  Yes, obviously. And Daniel, the most significant impact on the share count is going to come from the TCV sale of preferred stock. In terms of Greenline, it obviously occurred pretty early on in the last quarter. So, I think it’s fairly well baked into the numbers. Because the TCV transaction closed in early June and it was in two trenches, the second of which didn’t close until July 14. We will have an additional impact from the TCV transaction in the third quarter and that’s what I tried to outline when I gave the share guidance for the third quarter. 
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: So, that that 37.5 would be just maybe a tick higher assuming no other impacts given that it’s July 14. So, it’s a couple of weeks into the quarter as we talk about the fourth quarter?
James N.B. Rucker:  I took that into account, Daniel, when I gave the 37.5 number. The only thing that will vary will be the stock price and its impact on options and other equity on treated on the treasury method. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities:  Just as a quick follow up on the technology services. What does the customer pipeline look like right now in terms of how we think about this going forward?
T. Kelley Millet:  Well, within Greenline, without getting into too much detail with a consistent basis for managing and qualifying that pipeline. The pipeline is actually up since our acquisitions. So, we’re pleased by the fact that the pipeline net of sales continue to have that upward trend. We do think there are some opportunities in our organic trading solutions business. I would simply caveat that, that the principal consumers are dealers, regional dealers and IDBs at this point. And obviously, they are under significant cost pressures. 
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: In terms of the dealers that you already have on the platform, it looks like the fixed fees that you’re getting on the US side dipped a little bit by about, I guess, the amount of one dealer. And on the European side, it looks like they went up. Is that just some pricing change you made or has there been a dealer that fell off? I know you said Bear and ABN were likely to fall from the third quarter, so I’m not sure if it’s related to that.
James N.B. Rucker:  Yes, there was one dealer that did come off during the quarter. That is due to the consolidation in the industry in the US. In Europe, it will fluctuate a little bit because these dealer distribution fees are denominated largely in euros so you will see some small fluctuation from quarter to quarter based on the exchange rate. 
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: With respect to the July business mix, have you continued to see a shift towards the fixed business as opposed to floating rate notes? We saw that, I think, over the last couple of months.
T. Kelley Millet: Yes, we continue to see the same trend in that dealers are wary of committing any capital in the upper end broadly in the marketplace. So, they tend to work it on an agency basis, typically by phone. And our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate would not be materially different than the mix of fixed and floating in the second quarter. 
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Your investment yield was down a lot. I know you said it was lower average balances but how much of that is lower balances? How much is lower interest rates? Is there a mix shift here? I noticed one of the impacts on the tax rate was higher non-taxable income. Did you shift more into munis and would that lead to a lower run rate going forward or lower yield?
James N.B. Rucker:  I can’t split it out specifically but it is due to both a reduction in the average balances and the decline in interest rates. Interest rates are down a fair bit from a year ago. Typically, we have our investments in shorter-term securities and a good portion of it in tax-free municipal securities. Those rates are down fairly substantially from a year ago.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: I guess the last thing is just in terms of the professional services fees, what the deals behind this at this point. Should we see that revert to levels close to what we had in ‘07 or are we sort of stepped up in the current environment?
James N.B. Rucker:  Joe, which line item was that?
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: The professional fees.
James N.B. Rucker:  On the expense side?
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: That’s right. Yes.
James N.B. Rucker:  The professional and consulting fees were higher this quarter for two reasons. One is the impact of the acquisitions. So, some of the increase in professional and consulting expenses were the result of the acquisitions. We also incurred higher legal fees during this quarter than we normally do. So, I would expect somewhat of a reduction in future quarters as a result of lower legal expenses. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company. 
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company:  Just following up on the professional consulting fees. You obviously mentioned that the acquisitions played a part in the increase in the second quarter. You mentioned the legal fees. Are the legal fees tied to the acquisition or were there additional legal expenses that were abnormal?
James N.B. Rucker:  No, it was additional legal expenses not tied to the acquisitions that caused the increase there.
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: Can you provide some color on that?
James N.B. Rucker:  Yes, primarily it was resulting from a claim by an employee that went through arbitration during the quarter. The claim was dismissed in the arbitration but we did incur legal fees in taking that through the arbitration. 
Hugh Miller - Sidoti & Company: You commented that you were reducing the variable rate incentive compensation. Can you just add some insight into the thought process there?
T. Kelley Millet:  The employee incentive compensation is directly tied to pretax operating income so that will vary with our business results.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Howard Chen - Credit Suisse.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse:  Rick, you kicked off your prepared remarks highlighting the tumultuous market environment. Now that we’re about a quarter past the initial fall of Bear Stearns, do you have a sense of how much of that agency commission business and proprietary flow was absorbed by the rest of the broker dealer community?
T. Kelley Millet:  Well, obviously, total trading volumes are still down in the market, Howard. So, I do think that the credit events keep coming. Obviously, the most recent news was around the GSEs, which we think was primarily responsible for the return of credit spreads back to the high in this cycle. So, credit risk remains quite high. Dealer balance sheet repair is ongoing and as a result in the short-term, corporate bond volumes have been lower than we would normally expect with credit spreads at these levels. 
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: And then switching gears on credit derivatives. I know it’s a newer effort for you but just curious to your thoughts. There continues to be a lot going on in the industry with the announcements by the clearing corp, the acquisition of Credit X, the outside transition of broker teams. Can you discuss how you see this market evolving over the next year and maybe where your company fits into that conversation?
T. Kelley Millet:  Now, we’re very enthusiastic about the clearing and netting the initiatives that are taking place in the CDS industry. I think it’s natural, given the level of counter party risk in the market today that the industry focuses first on improving the clearing and netting and margining structure. So, our expectation is that, that will be the case probably throughout the balance of this year. But as those initiatives start to improve the settlement structure in the CDS industry, we are confident that the demand for electronic trading will grow. 
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: And then on capital management, can you discuss how much is currently less than the current share repurchase program and your plans for that? You alluded to efforts to protect the shareholders. The balance sheet remains really strong. So, I’m curious why maybe perhaps not being more aggressive on the share repurchase program. 
T. Kelley Millet:  Well, obviously, we were focusing on acquisitions and the TCV investment during the recent past. And as I mentioned in my comments, the strength of the balance sheet does give us plenty of flexibility on share repurchases as those will be subject to the market environment as we go forward. Our first priority, as always, is to grow and diversify our business. So, we like what we’ve done with recent acquisitions and if we see future opportunities, that will continue to be our priority in terms of the use of cash.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: Jim, what’s the current share repurchase program stand at?
James N.B. Rucker:  The current share repurchase program is fully utilized. So, that was actually back in January that we completed the last purchases under the previous program.
Howard Chen - Credit Suisse: So, even if you wanted to right now, your Board has not authorized you to repurchase any more?
James N.B. Rucker:  There’s not a program in place but as you know, Howard, that does not require much time should the Board decide that that’s the best use of cash for our shareholders. 
Operator:  At this time, we have no questions in queue. 
Richard M. McVey:  Thank you very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-26 06:00:00) =====
Executives: Stephen Davidson - IR Rick McVey - CEO and Chairman Kelley Millet - President Jim Rucker - CFO
Analysts: Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities
Operator: Welcome to the MarketAxess first quarter 2008 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Davidson: Good morning. Welcome to the MarketAxess first quarter 2008 conference call. For the call this morning, Rick McVey will review the highlights for the quarter. Kelley Millet will provide an update on the North American businesses. And then Jim Rucker will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2007. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release that was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick.
Rick McVey:  Thank you, and good morning. In the first quarter, we delivered solid financial results in spite of the ongoing credit market dislocation. Earnings were $0.05 per share for the quarter on revenue generation that was down only 3% from the prior year first quarter. The foundation of our franchise continues to get stronger, with a record number of investor clients electing to connect their order management systems to MarketAxess, increasing the points of connectivity with our clients and creating even higher barriers to entry for our competition. We are embedded in the workflow for investor clients. Due to the increased integration with investors, the level of client inquiry count was up 4% above the prior-year quarter in a period when US high-grade credit trading declined overall. We continue to see higher transaction fees per million in our US high-grade product, due to a significant increase in the average maturity of bonds traded on the system. Our new products in the other category recorded a 16% increase in inquiry count with particular strength in EM, high yield, and CDS. While we are disappointed with our European trading volumes, we do know that bank and finance paper, and floating rate notes, make up a larger percentage of the overall market in Europe. And those two areas have been most affected by the current credit crisis. In addition, the new issue calendar was largely dormant in Europe during the first quarter. With the addition of Greenline, we have gained a significant beachhead in a large growing market for fixed-related services. This high-potential revenue stream will serve to complement our core secondary trading related revenues in future quarters. Also with Greenline, we've expanded our client base, enhanced our technology products and services, and extended our product reach into other asset classes. Dealer liquidity is the missing piece in the secondary credit markets again for the first quarter. Dealers are facing balance sheet and credit risk constraints, reducing their ability to serve clients in a market-making capacity. On MarketAxess, that has resulted in fewer dealer responses per inquiry and a wide disparity in dealer prices. In the overall OTC credit market, the reduction in dealer liquidity is causing a disruption in the normal functioning of the market and a decline in credit trading activity. This will gradually improve through dealer balance sheet repair and an improvement in the dealer and bank funding markets. Ultimately, we are big believers in open, transparent markets to promote growth and liquidity for all market participants. We will continue to take steps to expand our client base, increase our sources of liquidity, and further enhance our technology in order to drive network benefits for our dealer and investor clients. On slide four, we provide an update on factors that are driving trading activity in our core market. In the upper left hand corner, liquid high-grade index spreads have widened a full 114 basis points form the end of June 2007. In the upper right hand corner, rolling 3-month volatility spiked to 8% in April, highlighting the fact that unfavorable credit market conditions persisted throughout the first quarter. Both the yield curve and the TED spread, while showing some retracement from the highs, still reflect risk aversion among investors and challenging funding markets for banks. The steepening of the yield curve in the lower left hand corner continues to have a beneficial impact on US high-grade revenues, due to an increase in average maturities traded on our system, leading to an increase in average variable fees per million. The reduction in dealer risk appetite and liquidity resulting from dealer balance sheet constraints has had a dampening effect on trading activity in corporate bonds with US high-grade trace volumes down 18% year over year. We are seeing some recent evidence that investor risk appetite is growing and dealer liquidity has improved. Should that continue, we believe that overall credit trading activity will grow. With that, let me turn it over to Kelley to discuss the North American Results.
Kelley Millet: Thank you, Rick, and good morning. On slide five, we present three core elements of our franchise that are critical to our growth strategy. First, our core trading businesses continue to show underlying strength despite the drop-off in dealer liquidity. When markets stabilize, we expect that the favorable mix of business, combined with an increase in investor demand for our trading solutions and increased industry volumes will positively impact our financial results. Second, our connectivity with clients has never been stronger as we continue to imbed ourselves deeper into our clients' daily workflow. 151 investor clients are now connected. For the full year 2007, 37 new clients were connected. And in the first quarter of this year alone, we connected 13 new clients with another 32 in testing. 30% of trade counts and 29% of executed trading volumes has now generated by client OMS system, compared to 18% for both in the first quarter of last year. Finally, with our acquisition of Greenline, TWS, and the build-out of our organic technology services, our overall product offering has been greatly expanded. And we have diversified our client base to include more hedge funds, global exchanges, and other electronic trading platforms. On slide six, we show the long-term trend in FINRA TRACE, our respective share, and provide more detail on the mix of fixed and floater rate bond trading for both TRACE and MarketAxess. Overall buying and share measures are only one factor in establishing the value of the MarketAxess franchise. A deeper dive is required to fully understand our performance. Lack of balance sheet, unattractive risk-reward characteristics, and concentration in bank and finance credits have impaired the trading liquidity in FRNs. As a result, estimated industry FRN volumes went from 79 billion in the first quarter of last year to 48 billion in the first quarter of 2008, a decline of 39%. MarketAxess volumes fell further as investors saw scarce liquidity over the phone and dealers worked to orders on an agency basis. Excluding FRNs, our fixed-rate, high-grade share would be essentially unchanged with an estimated 7% in first quarter 2008 versus 7.1% in the first quarter of last year. Thus, this quality business with much higher fees per million has remained on this system. Now let me comment briefly on the TRACE data for April. TRACE average daily volume has increased in April to 9.4 billion per day, up from 8.2 billion in average daily volume in March. On slide seven, we show the continued strength of inquiry count driven by our investor clients. In North America, our core RQ client franchise showed continued strength across high-grade, as well as high yield and EM, despite difficult market conditions, where both dealer responses and hit rates declined. The quality of the business that was executed over our platform continues to improve with high-grade average weighted years to maturity of 55%, European years to maturity up 12%, high yield up 10%, and finally EM up 3%. An increase in the average weighted years to maturity is one of the key drivers in increasing average fees per million and reflects the continued positive trend for the platform. This signals to us that we are facing broad macroeconomic issues. And we are confident that investors remain actively engaged on the system. One final comment regarding our new product areas, including DealerAxess and CDS, in this type of market with dealers focused on risk management amidst extreme market volatility, it has been more difficult to get dealers to embrace new e-trading activity and accelerate the growth of these two products. Slide eight is an update on our technology products and services. We have assembled the key components of our tech services offering. And the integration and performance of Greenline is on schedule. Greenline reported approximately $6 million in revenue in 2007, which was 40% above 2006. And based on our early experience with the business, we see solid growth rates continuing. Current projections are for Greenline to be earnings neutral in 2008, including the impact of the amortization of intangibles and the opportunity cost to funding. We expect the acquisition to be cash flow positive this year in 2008. And we expect Greenline to be accretive to EPS in 2009. Our focus is on creating and achieving revenue synergies, as we capitalize on our relationships with more than 30 dealers and over 1,000 institutional clients. As Rick mentioned, it appears that the fixed product is less affected by the current market conditions. New exchanges are emerging globally. And high-velocity fixed messaging is at the forefront of customer technology spend. We do believe this business will provide good growth that is not correlated to market trading volumes and is one part of our drive to build further scale and revenue diversification. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for a review of the financial results.
Jim Rucker: Thank you, Kelley. Please turn to slide nine for our earnings performance. Revenue for the quarter of $22.9 million was $560,000 or 3% above the fourth quarter of 2007, but 3% below the first quarter of 2007. Earnings per share of $0.05 were $0.02 below the prior-year period. The effective tax rate was 46% this quarter due to several unfavorable items, including the absence of the research and development tax credit, a decrease in tax-exempt investment income, and an increase in non-deductible expenses, relative to the decline in pretax income. We anticipate that the effective tax rate for the full year will be between 42% and 45%. Now let me turn to some of the details regarding our first quarter results. On slide 10, we've laid out trading volumes and fees per million. Total trading volume for the quarter of 64 billion was down 38%, compared to the first quarter of 2007. Turning to US high-grade, we're now breaking out our fixed-rate and floating-rate high-grade business, so that we provide a higher level of transparency with regard to the mix of business traded over the platform. Total US high-grade trading volume declined 36% versus the prior-year first quarter. High-grade transaction fees were $119 per million, up from $80 in the first quarter of 2007 and $112 in the fourth quarter of 2007. This is primarily the result of two factors. First, total FRN trading volumes were down 82%, while the higher-margin, higher-quality fixed-rate trading volume showed a much smaller decline of 17%. Secondly, we've seen an increase in the duration of bonds traded over the platform. And we earn higher fees on trades of longer-maturity bonds. The average weighted year to maturity of bonds traded over the platform increased to 8.2 years from 5.5 years in the first quarter of 2007. European high-grade trading volumes were down 72%, reflecting the more difficult credit market environment there. I'll talk more about the European fees when we turn to the next slide. Other volume increased 15%, primarily due to increases in CDS volume on our inter-dealer platform DealerAxess. As CDS transactions incur lower fees per million than some of the other products in this category. The average fee per million declined from $148 to $131. Slide 11 provides you with the revenue detail. US high-grade commissions, including monthly distribution fees and transaction fees were down $1.3 million, or 9%, from the first quarter of 2007. The first quarter of 2007 included $1.5 million in DealerAxess monthly minimums. The absence of the DealerAxess minimums in this quarter and the 3% decline in commission revenue were partially offset by an increase of $400,000 in the monthly distribution fees. Total European high-grade commissions were down by only $165,000, or 3%, compared to the first quarter of 2007, as a result of the new European fee plan, which was introduced in June of last year. In accordance with the new fee plan, we now receive monthly dealer distribution fees that were $3.7 million for the quarter, as well as transaction fees that were $106 per million and totaled $900,000 for the quarter. Given the recent consolidations in the dealer community, including the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan and ABN Amro by Royal Bank of Scotland, we are expecting these two dealers to come off the system in the third quarter of 2008, which will reduce our US and European high-grade monthly distribution fees by approximately $750,000 per quarter. All other revenues were 19% above the first quarter of 2007, primarily driven by an increase in our technology products and services revenue, which totaled $770,000, the majority of which came from Greenline. This was partially offset by a decline in our investment income. Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. Total expenses were just 4% above the first quarter of 2007. Excluding the impact of the Greenline and TWS acquisitions, our expenses would have shown a small decline compared to the first quarter of 2007. Employee compensation and benefits expense was 4% below the prior-year quarter as a result of lower incentive compensation that varied according to operating income. Employee compensation and benefits, as a percent of revenue, was 48%, in line with the first quarter of 2007, and included $400,000 in severance. Employee headcount, as of March 31st, was 202, compared to 171 in the first quarter of 2007. The 202 headcount number includes an additional 30 staff from the Greenline and TWS acquisitions. On slide 13, we've updated the expense guidance for full-year 2008. We expect total expenses to be in the range of $81 million to $84 million. This guidance reflects additional Greenline related expenses and lower variable incentive compensation. I expect non-cash expenses to be approximately $15.5 million, including an estimated $1.4 million in amortization of intangible assets related to the Greenline acquisition. We expect our free cash flow generation for the full year to be approximately two times our reported net income, in line with the multiple for 2007. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be in the range of $5 million to $7 million. On slide 15, we have summary balance sheet data. Our cash, cash equivalents, and securities balances, as of March 31st, were $89 million, down from $124 million at year end, as a result of the $35 million in cash used for the purchase of Greenline. Cash and securities on the balance sheet represent $2.65 per share. And the deferred tax asset represents another $1.17 per share. Our Board continues to regularly evaluate all uses of our cash balances to maximize shareholder value. Total stockholders' equity as of March 31st, 2008, was $180 million, representing book value on a diluted basis of $5.39. Now, let me pass the call back to Rick for concluding remarks.
Rick McVey: In conclusion, we remain confident in the growth prospects for our business for the following reasons; investor demand for our electronic trading solutions remained strong, despite short-term declines in market liquidity and trading volumes. We are broadening our relationships into both new electronic trading markets and broader technology solutions with positive signs of growth. Our competitive position remained strong with the dominant share of the institutional client-to-dealer electronic credit market and growing barriers to entry. We are confident that market liquidity will normalize, and investor interest in the credit space will grow, due to improved valuations in this sector with wider credit spreads. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Harris from Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Morning, guys.
Rick McVey: Good morning, Daniel.
Jim Rucker: Morning, Daniel.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: If we go on the assumptions that credit has sort of bottomed here, and I think we actually got some comments on that over the last few days from some people in some pretty high places. And I think I get the sense here at Goldman that we think that we might've seen the worst. What do you think it's going to take for the brokers or the dealers to open up their balance sheets to provide more liquidity to this system? Is it just a high level of risk taking? Or they just feel that they're going to be able move product at a faster rate?
Kelley Millet: Daniel, its Kelley. I think I'd look at the market in a couple different segments. In the very short-end of the marketplace, I do believe that both short-term fixed and FRNs will remain somewhat problematic for '08. And as you know, as we've broken down those differences, it's more of a volume issue for us and much less of a profitability issue. I just think people have learned from a dealer perspective that the risk-reward characteristics are not especially strong there. When I look at the fixed-rate business, as we talked about, the average year to maturity has extended. I think at these spread levels, that will continue to extend. I think that would be a good sign. And what I also like is the fact that our share of that fixed-rate business has actually been stable, despite the fact that we've had probably the worst credit market certainly in my 25 years on the street. So, I would look at the market and probably segment it in two ways, the short-end probably still being a challenge, but the longer-term fixed-rate business coming back. The final point would be, obviously, the new issue business has been very, very robust. We had a $9 billion offering yesterday. Probably, I think it is the largest offering in six years. After those deals free to trade and are more liquid in the secondary market that tends to be a boost in trading in our system, but on a like basis. So I think it will be a little bit of a mixed bag. But quite frankly, I view it as if we are in fact coming out of a bottom a constructive view for the second half.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: So maybe try to put it a different way and I appreciate those comments. If you're seeing increased demand or increased client interactions on a hit rate side, but just putting those requests in, but dealers are still not responding and Kelley and Rick, you guys worked at some large investment banks in the past. What do you think it's going to take for management to say let's start responding more to these things on the electronic platform, because I hear I think that there's a lot of positive things relative to where we've been going out on the market. But it still feels to me like the penetration from the brokers is still somewhat, not the penetration, but their responses are still somewhat lower than I would've otherwise thought.
Rick McVey: I think, Daniel, this is not an electronic issue. This is an overall market issue. We consistently hear from large investors that they're having similar results in getting dealers to respond and utilize their balance sheet for market making, whether they go by phone or electronically. And just to add to Kelley's response in terms of what it will take to change that dynamic, one is seeing a gradual increase in tier I capital ratios. We have seen some improvement there over the last three or four weeks. Banks and dealers have been successful both raising new capital and selling some credit risk intensive assets. So as that improves, then I think the balance sheet will start to free up for market making for clients. The other positive sign we've seen in the very recent past is that bank funding cost pressures seem to be abating. And if they're able to fund assets at better levels, that, too, will help in making them more willing to warehouse credit assets for their clients in a market-making capacity.  So I think that the other sign we see is that, clearly, the clients are using the system more for their inquiries, not less. So that means on a relative basis that the clients are having at least as good of an experience electronically as they are by phone, with the only exception really being the FRN market, where it has been so difficult for the banks to fund FRN positions at attractive levels that they have been unwilling to take them onto their balance sheet. And as a result, most of the business that's getting done in FRNs in our opinion is being done on an order or agency basis, not the traditional market making.
Kelley Millet: And two other things that I watch very carefully, Daniel, in terms of the health of the dealers just broadly, but also on the platform; one, what's their capacity to bid for their own paper, and broadly speaking, bank and finance paper in general, which is such an enormous part of the corporate cash market. At the depth of the crisis, in fact, we saw dealers not even willing to use their own balance sheet to bid on their own paper. So the health of the bank and finance paper market is really key to better understanding where the health of the dealers are and where risk taking is in general. We're beginning to see much better signs. Secondly, as you're at these wide spread levels, as Rick talked about, if you're concerned about liquidity, you're going to be very careful about shorting bonds you don't have in inventory. Over the last two months, we had people only willing to, in a sense sell bonds, offer bonds that was actually in their inventory even for partial size. We are seeing, we are hearing, both on the platform, away, the willingness of people to short bonds, because they feel they have enough liquidity to get it back. And at these spread levels, they're probably more concerned of bonds moving tighter than they are moving wider.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: That actually was really helpful, guys. Thanks. Just a couple of more. With the disruptions that we've seen in the credit market, putting the peak leading up to the Bear Stearns meltdown, have you guys got any more feedback from clients that those clients would look to the MKTX platform as a potential, increasing your penetration of the CDS market. That they're looking for you to take a leading role in that? It does look like your other income was much better than some of your other areas. So it certainly seems that way to us.
Kelley Millet: Well, Daniel, again, it's Kelley. We have seen, and I'm going to underscore modest progress in the CDS franchise. What we're seeing is that the emerging markets asset class appears to be the area where we can get most traction. I think it's because it's a more electronic market, a more global market, and a more concentrated market. That has clearly been the best volume and most consistent activity in our inter-dealer or DealerAxess platform. And we're very pleased that we're beginning to see client-to-dealer activity in EM, both in index, the index role, as well as single names in both corporate and sovereigns. From what we understand, we are the only true client-to-dealer electronic solution and producing results. But let me underscore that these are baby steps with a modest number of dealers and a modest number of buy side clients. But Rick knows better than I do that's the way in which these new markets develop. So we are seeing some encouraging signs. But again, dealers are somewhat leery of embracing new e-trading activity, especially in the light of intense market disruption.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks very much. And then, Jim, I just want to make sure I understand what you were saying on your comments surrounding the monthly minimums. So you're expecting to lose two clients as of the third quarter. And that's across Europe and the US about $750,000 in total per quarter.
Jim Rucker: Yes, Daniel, that's right. That was the number for the third quarter. We expect that they will come of at the end of the second quarter. And the number I gave of $750,000 includes the impact both for the US and the European monthly distribution fees.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Rick McVey: Thanks, Daniel.
Kelley Millet: Thank you, Daniel.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Banc of America Securities. You may proceed.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Hey, guys. This is actually [Joe Heary].
Rick McVey: Hi, Joe.
Jim Rucker: Hi, Joe.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: How you doing?
Rick McVey: Good. Thank you.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: On the tax rate, how should we think about the increased tax rate in terms of the interplay with the NOLs and their ability to continue shielding income going forward? Is there any impact on that?
Jim Rucker: Yes, the only impact really on the NOLs, Joe, obviously, is that we use the NOLs at the rate of the tax provision. But, given the modest change in the tax rate, I don't think it should have any significant impact on the way that you look at the deferred tax asset on the NOLs.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Great, and then in terms of the severance cost that you mentioned, what was that specifically related to? Is that from the deals that you did? And should we expect to see more as we go forward? Or is that pretty much something that you did and that’s behind us right now?
Rick McVey: It was partly due to the fact that we did have some new opportunities through the acquisitions and partly due to some very modest downsizing that we did in order to make some existing operations more efficient.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Just one quick question on the share count, it came down a bit more than I would've expected, given the Greenline deal, and the end to the share buyback program. I was wondering what drove that during the quarter.
Jim Rucker: Yes, I would just say two things on that, Joe. One is, remember that the Greenline acquisition only took place in March. And so, on a weighted average basis, you might have seen the full impact from the 725,000 shares that we issued as part of the Greenline acquisition. The second thing at play here is the impact of the stock options and restricted stock under the treasury method, given the fact that the stock price has been low through the quarter. And the impact of the options and restricted stock is less than it was both the year ago and in the fourth quarter.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And then in terms of just your bias at this point on capital management deals versus potentially restarting the share buyback program, any thoughts on that?
Rick McVey: None that we're prepared to really comment on today, Joe. I think we are always interested in new technology assets with great growth characteristics that will further round out the set of services that we provide to the institutional credit markets. So fair to say that we're very pleased with what we've done with TWS and Greenline. And we continue to look for more opportunities along that path, but nothing beyond that to comment on today.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And just lastly, with respect to the variable fees, we've obviously seen the US fees moving up. Given the mix shift that's gone on already in your volumes, and where the yield curve is at, are we reaching a high water mark in terms of where those fees per million can go in the US?
Rick McVey: I think that what we would expect, Joe, is that, as dealer balance sheet constraints hopefully dissipate and market making returns to normal that we will see a return of floating-rate note business traded electronically on the MarketAxess system. And all else equal, as that business comes back, we should see a positive return to overall trading volumes and market share. But it will also cause a lower blended fee per million in our total high-grade fees. So, that is one factor, I think, to look out for with respect to the future periods and the average fee per million. The other really relates to the shape of the curve. If it stays as steep as it has been over the recent past, I think these numbers are a reasonable estimate of what to expect in the future. However, if the curve starts to flatten out, then we would probably see some decline in the average maturity of bonds traded on the system.
Joe Heary - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: This concludes the question and answer portion of the call. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick McVey for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2007 Q3  (2007-10-31 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Mr. Kelley Millet -President Mr. Rick McVey - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr Jim Rucker - Chief Financial Officer Mr. Stephen Davidson – Head of Investor Relations
Analysts: Howard Chen – Credit Suisse Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Davidson: Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2007 Conference Call. For the call this morning, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MarketAxess will provide a strategic update for the company. Kelly Killet, President of MarketAxess will provide an update on our North America businesses and then Jim Rucker, our Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results for the quarter. We will then go back to Rick for closing comments before the Q&A session. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company’s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company’s actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release that was issued earlier this morning available on our website. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick McVey.
Rick McVey: Good morning and Happy Halloween. The third quarter of 2007 was one of the most challenging quarters ever for the credit markets as the sub prime contingent rippled through the market causing a severe drop in credit market liquidity. Despite these difficult markets, MarketAxess reported solid results for the third quarter of 2007 helped by an expanding base of fixed commission revenue, a more favorable mix of business and continued strong expense management. For the third quarter of 2007, MarketAxess reported net income of $2.4 million or $0.07 per share compared to $1.3 million or $0.04 per share in the prior year period. Our pre-tax margin was 16%, well above the 11% reported during the prior year period, but down from the second quarter level. The drop in market liquidity clearly had an impact on electronic trading with our estimated share of US NASD high-grade TRACE falling to 7.8% from 9.3% in the third quarter of ’06. We believe this was caused by extreme ill liquidity in the short end of the corporate bond market and a shift in the client mix within TRACE away from traditional asset managers. Kelly will further address market conditions in his comments. On the expense front, third quarter 2007 expenses were flat compared to the third quarter of 2006 reflecting continued expense discipline. Our financial position and strong cash generation continue to be sources of strength. Since the end of the third quarter of 2006, when our cash balances were $124 million, we have repurchased $30 million in MarketAxess shares. We ended the third quarter of 2007 with $128 million in cash and securities demonstrating that our operating cash flow has fully funded our share buy-back program. In summary, we recorded $0.07 earnings per share in the extremely challenging market environment. Our higher base of fixed revenues, ongoing expense management and trend towards higher variable fees per million all contributed to the improvement in earnings. We believe we’re well positioned for growth as credit market liquidity returns to more normal levels. Slide four provides a snapshot of our quarterly results since the beginning of ’06. In spite of the downturn in the sequential results for the third quarter, we are still showing very good progress over the prior year period. As you can see, our business has shown a consistent improvement in profitability driven by higher revenues and controlled expenses. Operating margins have been growing attractively from prior year levels. And on slide five, this momentum is clearly evident in the year-to-date numbers. Revenue is running 16% above the prior year. Expenses have been held steady and are less than 2% above the prior year and most importantly for our shareholders, net income and EPS are running about 165% above the prior year. These results reinforce the fact that we have very attractive incremental margins in our business. On slide six, we provide an update on some of the key credit market drivers. The upper left hand corner shows the impact of the recent turmoil in the corporate bond market. Liquid high-grade index spreads wind up full 43 basis points at their highs in September from the end of June. The upper right hand corner shows the benign volatility of US Corporate Index spreads of the previous six quarters came to an end during the third quarter with the rolling three-month volatility spiking to 2.7%. In the short-run, the sudden and severe repricing in the credit markets has led to a reduction in liquidity and trading activity in corporate bonds. However, we believe that a return to normal market liquidity combined with the increase in spreads in volatility will cause an increase in trading activity among traditional investment managers, our primary client base. In the lower left hand corner, the recent steepening of the yield curve has led to an increase in average maturities traded on our system and a subsequent increase in average variable fees per million. The lower right hand corner shows high-grade new issue volumes have remained robust despite the difficult market conditions.  An active new issue calendar supports secondary trading over the long term. On slide seven, two trends of the fixed income market are worth noting. The left graph shows the shape of the yield curve versus the average maturity of bonds traded on the MarketAxess system. As you can see, the dramatic flattening of the curve over the last four years caused investors to trade shorter maturity bonds. The recent steepening of the yield curve has caused an extension of average maturities traded leading to higher average fees per million in US Corporate bonds. The right graph shows the correlation between TRACE high-grade volumes, spreads and spread volatility. We believe that the lack of spread volatility caused a contraction in overall corporate bond trading over the last few years. In spite of the extreme lack of liquidity in the third quarter, as we look in to 2008, we believe a case can be made that the increase in spreads and spread volatility will be a positive for corporate bond trading volumes. On slide eight, I wanted to update you on potential uses of our substantial cash balances. As I stated earlier, our operating cash generation continues to be well in excess of reported net income and has fully funded our stock buy back since the third quarter of 2006. There are three strategic options that we are actively considering for uses of cash. First, we continue to consider acquisitions that would expand our technology capabilities in the fixed income e-trading space. We feel that acquisitions that support the growth of our trading, data and technology services businesses will allow us to broaden relationships with key institutions and diversify our sources of revenue. Second, we will revisit ongoing share repurchase plans with our board when the current plan is completed. And third, we are always looking to identify new organic opportunities that meet the needs of our institutional costumers. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kelly for an update on North America.
Kelly Millet: Thank you, Rick. For my North America update this morning, I will address the difficult market conditions we experienced in the third quarter. In addition, I will review the market impact on our estimated share of NASD high-grade TRACE as well as on our volumes and mix of business. On slide ten, you can clearly see the drop off in trading volumes in our core US high-grade business. Third quarter performance was degraded by the significant market dislocation we saw in August and September. The rapid repricing of credit which began in July led to a severe liquidity squeeze in August for our dealers. Reduced dealer liquidity and risk appetite decreased the number and quality of the levels quoted by dealers and dampened investor inquiry volume over the system. The ensuing liquidity by appointment environment pushed Client Flow business back to the phone resulting in a decline of our estimated share during the quarter falling from 9.3% of NASD high-grade TRACE in the third quarter of last year to 7.8% in the third quarter of this year. FRN trading volume, normally the most liquid short-duration segment of the client’s slow business that we address and the majority of which is issued by banks and brokers declined 53% to $7.3 billion during this quarter.
upper end: The average weighted years to maturity pertains to maturity trade increased to 8.3 years in the third quarter of this year, up from 7.8 years in the second quarter of this year and 6.7 years in the prior year of third quarter. This positively impacted our fees per million. In October month-to-date of this year, we are seeing a moderate increase in our average daily volume of inquiry and a return of larger size trades to the system, especially in FRN. One quick note on CDS volume, our other category was up strongly versus the third quarter of 2006 and this was primary due to improved CDS volumes which moved four-fold over the prior year period. At slide eleven, we showed a trend in our share of NASD high grade TRACE in the Client Flow business. While our overall share of NASD high grade TRACE and our share of the Client Flow business have dropped due to market conditions, our value proposition for dealers and clients is stronger than ever. With the recent drop in dealer profitability, fixed income trading managers will be under even more pressure today to achieve cost savings, adhere to compliance regulations and continue to efficiently serve their clients. We estimate that Client Flow trading, as we define it, makes up approximately 57% of NASD high-grade TRACE year-to-date. A material part of it, we believe, should go electronic over time. Finally, on slide 12, we have updated statistics on OMS initiated trading by our investor clients. Straight through processing solutions increased the value of our platform to investors and raised barriers to entry competitors. The number of trades initiated by client order management systems messaging continues to grow. At the end of the third quarter, 20% of our trade counts and 18% of our trade volume was initiated by client OMS systems. We added 18 new FTP connections with investor clients bringing the total connections to 131 up from 113 at the end of the first quarter of this year. Now, I would like to turn it over to Jim for a review of the financial results. Jim.
Jim Rucker: Thank you, Kelley. On slide 13, we have outlined our volumes from the 2006 and 2007 third quarters. Trading volume from the third quarter of 2007 was clearly impacted by the seizing up of liquidity in the credit markets, with total trading volume down 32% compared to the second quarter. Trading volume of $76 billion was down 10% over the third quarter of 2006 impacted by a 20% decline in US high grade, a 21% decline in European high grade, offset by a 38% increase in the other volume category. The increase in the other volume category was primarily driven by an increase in CDS trading volume. Please turn to slide 14 for our earnings performance. Despite the low trading volumes in the third quarter, our earnings per share of $0.07 were above the third quarter of 2006 and only $0.03 below our strong second quarter result. In short, we were able to generate $0.07 in earnings for our shareholders during some of the most challenging credit marketing conditions in recent memory. Three factors contributed to this, a full quarter’s impact to the new European fee plan that we introduced in June, variable employee compensation expense that was below the second quarter level and an increase in the high-grade variable transaction fees that Kelly referred to earlier. Our tax provision in Q3 ’07 reflected an effective tax rate of the quarter of 34% compared to 42% in the third quarter of 2006. The primary reason for this was a higher percentage of our earnings coming from our UK subsidiary which is currently subject to a lower tax rate than our US operations. I anticipate the effective tax rate to the fourth quarter to be between 36% and 39%. But in the longer term, expect the rate to revert to approximately 40%. Slide 15 provides you with the revenue detail. Total commission revenue was up 8% compared to the third quarter of 2006. US high grade commission revenue was down only 2% on a 20% decline in trading volume and reflects a decrease and DealerAxess Monthly Minimum which was offset by increases in the client to dealer fixed distribution fees and the client to dealer variable transaction revenue. Fees per million increased by 31% from $77.00 in the third quarter 2006 to $101.00 per million for the third quarter 2007 as a result of the increase in the average maturity of trades executed over the platform. European high grade commission revenue was up 49% despite the declining trading volumes that I referred to earlier, clearly showing the benefits of our new European high grade fee plan and I will provide more detail on this on the next slide. In the other category, while trading volumes increased by 38%, commission revenue increased by only 2%. The primary reason for this was an increasing contribution from the CDS product which represented a significant portion of the volume increase year-over-year. Fees per million in CDS are currently much lower than the other products in this category. Slide 16 shows the positive impact of the first four quarter under the new European fee plan. While European high grade trading volume decreased 21% from the third quarter of 2006, following the implementation of the new European fee plan in June, commission revenue increased by 49% to $4.9 million from $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2006. Due to our success in signing most of the European dealers on to the new fee plan, we now have a base of monthly dealer distribution fees that is of a similar level to the variable commissions that dealers we were paying a year ago. But in addition we’ve been able to earn the variable transaction fees that we electronically add in to the prices quoted by the dealers. The combination of the fixed monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees under the new plan had a substantial positive impact on revenues in the third quarter compared to the commission revenue we would have earned had we still been on the old plan. Average variable transaction fees of $99.00 per million of the quarter were about the $90.00 we guided you to in the second quarter call. Similar to what we saw in the US, we had a more favorable mix of business which boosted our fees per million during the quarter. Slide 17 provides you with the expense detail. Total expenses in the third quarter of 2007 were flat to the third quarter of 2006 and down $700,000.00 from the second quarter largely as a result of lower variable employee compensation due to lower operating income for the quarter. Employee compensation and benefits as a percent of revenue was 46%, down from 50% in the third quarter of 2006. I am now expecting our expenses for the full year to be below the guidance range that I have previously given. I anticipate full year 2007 expenses to be in the range of $76.2 million to $76.8 million. On slide 18, we see the increasing coverage of our expense base by our monthly distribution fees and non-trading related revenue. Coverage of our expense base by the US and European high-grade monthly distribution fees and the non-trading related revenue has increased from 65% of our expense base in the third quarter of 2006 to 80% in the third quarter of 2007. The implementation of the new fee plan for the European high-grade product has been a significant contributor to this development. In challenging markets such as the ones we experienced during this past quarter, we have a steady base of revenue to support our earnings while at the same time giving us plenty of upside in variable transaction fees. On slide 19, we show our strong free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date. Our year-to-date free cash flow generation was 2.2 times our reported year-to-date net income. This translates into $18.5 million or $0.53 per share, well above the reported $0.24 in earnings per share. Year-to-date non-cash expenses, which include depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation and deferred taxes were $15.2 million. On slide 20, we have the summary balance sheet data. During the third quarter of 2007, we repurchased 205,000 shares at a total cost of $3.5 million, and as of October 30, we have purchased a total of $2.2 million shares at a total cost of $30.9 million, which leaves $9.1 million remaining in the program. Our cash balances of $128 million are just 2% below the $131 million at year-end 2006. Total stockholder’s equity was $176 million representing book value on a diluted basis of $5.10 per share and we continue to have no debt. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Rick for closing comments before the Q&A.
Rick McVey: Thank you, Jim. In summary, no one could have expected the severity of the credit market downturn in the third quarter. We feel good about our financial results in light of the market environment. Our hard work on fee models and expense management served our shareholders well during the quarter. We believe that as the market stabilizes, the trading environment will show improvement versus the benign conditions of the last few years. We remain optimistic about the growth we had in our core corporate bond business and a large opportunity in new products and services. Now, I would like to open the call up to your questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Good morning everyone.
Richard McVey: Good morning, Howard.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Rick, I guess the first one is for you. I was hoping to get an update on the competitive landscape during the quarter. Here in the U.S. we saw an up announcement by the broker dealers to reinvest in TradeWeb, and in Europe, we saw the launch of Liquidity Hub. So, I guess could you touch on both of these and give your overall sense of the competitive environment now compared to where we were a year ago, et cetera?
Rick McVey: Sure and I would be happy to do so, and the reality is within the credit space, I do not think much has changed. TradeWeb in particular has been a strong competitor of MarketAxess really since our existence, and during that period of time, at one point, there were 100% owned by dealers and at another point, 100% owned by Thompson. So we’ve been competing in various ownership structures and the investment that was made during the quarter that you point out brings the level of dealer ownership in TradeWeb back to about the same level as dealer ownership at MarketAxess. So we don’t view this as any significant change on the competitive front, and the reality is given the size of the organizations that are involved, whether it is in TradeWeb or MarketAxess, the ownership in equity in the e-trading platforms is small relative to the focus on their own business and their own P&L. So as much as we might like to think differently, we do not believe that dealer equity is the most important component that drives their trading behaviour. And we believe that we’ve proven to have sustainable competitive advantages in the credit space based on the technology that we’ve worked over the last seven years to build, the network that is now more entrenched in our platform than ever and the fee model which is considered by all to be fair and equitable and those advantages continue to serve us well. It is interesting that you point out Liquidity Hub because based on the public record following the TradeWeb deal, it would certainly appear to all involved that the primary focus in terms of growth for TradeWeb is the interest rate swap market, and arguably trying to recapture dealer support and dealer alignment that was temporarily lost to Liquidity Hub. And by all accounts, Liquidity Hub is solely and exclusively focused on the interest rate swap market. So, I think the key for us is to continue to move quickly to build our credit business as we have been doing. We do not think there is a significant change during the quarter in the competitive environment. And the other piece, just to bring you up to date, Howard is, there was a lot of talk obviously about six months ago about the re-launch of corporate bond trading at the New York Stock Exchange and we continue to believe that that has had very little if any impact in the institutional credit trading space.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Okay, great, thanks. And then second one, Rick, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the challenging environment and the ceasing up of the credit markets this summer. From what we heard from some of the managements and seeing in the results from some of the larger CDS players, it appears liquidity did not cease up there. I know you’ve mentioned it was a positive contributor to the other volume growth this quarter, but maybe can you elaborate that on either the numbers, the contribution that it’s providing or just qualitatively what you’re hearing from clients and the incremental clients and the opportunity from where you sit.
Kelley Millet: First, I think, I would preface my remarks by again repeating that client to dealer trading in CDS is in its very, very early days. We continue to think our opportunity is to focus on two clear needs as we have seen and discovered across our customer base. First is a more efficient means of execution, and the second is a more efficient post trade processing and settlement aspect to the trade. We are making solid progress in the client to dealer space, especially in the index product within the inter-dealer space. We are reasonably pleased with our progress to date in CDS especially in EM. And again, as Rick said earlier, we are strong believers in our value proposition that we deliver to our customer base, and I continue to believe that the pace of client to dealer trading will accelerate in CDS. It was a more liquid market in certain parts of the CDS market, as you point out, versus the cash market. Well, quite frankly, Howard that has been the case even in a more normal market. So I think in summary, we’re pleased to date, but I’d like to preface that with the fact that we’re in the very, very early days in the trading of CDS electronically, especially client to dealer.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Okay, great, thanks. And while I have you on the line, Kelley, last quarter, the company benefited from something of a development contract with one of the broker dealers, I think you mentioned in last quarter’s results. Any color on the pipeline? Is that a business that you continue to want to be in and grow over time, or should we think of that contribution last quarter as somewhat of a one-off?
Kelley Millet: We continue to believe that we deliver world-class technology and connectivity to our customer base. We have invested substantially over the years in that. And in addition to the technology itself, we also believe strongly we have world-class talent as well. Not surprisingly in the third quarter, Howard, a lot of the technology and business focus churned internally. We are very pleased with the portfolio of opportunities, however, that we currently have on our plate. And we continue to strongly believe the tech services will provide a modest diversification and even further integrate us into the infrastructure and the technology of our most important customers.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. And then, Jim, maybe a final one for you. At the revised midpoint of your expense guidance, it looks like expenses will be up 2% year-over-year. Maybe this is jumping ahead a quarter to next quarter’s results in your guidance there, but any thoughts? With the $76.5 million expense base on a full year basis, does that provide you enough to both kind of run the business, invest in the places that you want to invest? Given the current environment and maybe even a potential improvement in terms of volumes, is this is a good operating expense level that we are at now?
Jim Rucker: I think if you look back over a little bit of a longer term rather than just over the past nine months and look back over two or three years, what you’ll see is a growth in operating expenses has been somewhere in the high single digits. And that’s during a period when we built up two significant new products, namely, CDS and DealerAxess. So I think, we continue to believe the expense growth rates somewhere in that range either high single digit, is what we need to continue to fuel growth in our products.
Howard Chen – Credit Suisse: Great, that’s helpful. Thank so much, everyone.
Jim Rucker: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Harris with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Daniel Harris: I appreciate the commentary on the long-term potential TRACE volumes next year or maybe further out than that, but more near term, given that volatility has somewhat stabilized even though the spreads are still wide, how do you guys think about industry volumes over the next quarter or two, especially as I sit here and look at October volumes, looking like they are down somewhere between 10% and 15% year over year?
Rick McVey : Just quickly on the TRACE front, Daniel, the October average daily volume is off a little bit further from September, but not materially so. We obviously have more trading days, so there is not a significant change in the current market environment as we start the fourth quarter. Kelley has few comments with respect to the outlook going forward.
Kelley Millet: We are, as I said in my prepared remarks, seeing modest improvement increase in average daily volume of inquiry on the system. We are seeing the quality and quantity of dealer responses improve as well. And we are also seeing the return of large size trade, i.e. in excess of $100 million return back to the platform as well, really concentrated not surprisingly in FRN. That being said, we continue to monitor and work closely with our customers and it’s been a challenging three or four months and there are weeks like this week where their attention turns away from e-trading market to critical risk management issues, the Fed today, the Payroll numbers on Friday. I spent 24 years in the dealer community and I have gone through a number of these cycles. One of the first order of business is as you go through this cycle as things begin to stabilize is that you critically assess your staff, which at times can be more than half your expense base, you critically assess your efficiency and that is mid office and back office. As a result of that, I am more convinced about our value preposition and not just in the long term but as people look at their budget process in their own prospects for ‘08, I think we can be an important part to contributing to a more efficient low cost execution of trade as the dealer community serves their most important customers.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, that is really an interesting point, as we have obviously seen the dislocation, the credit market having an impact potential on staffing at the investment banks and the dealers. How do you see that changing in terms of how clients interact with the system, do you think that the dealers are doing more automated quotes back to clients as potentially they’ve moved people off the desk for these low margin products?
Kelley Millet : As I said in my prepared remarks, we do believe that some 57% of trades year-to-date is in that sort of flow category and low margin business and in our connectivity which I highlighted on the client buy-side, there is also significant work going on with the dealers via their communication and transactions with us through the APIs. I do believe that this market environment will pressure dealers to critically assess their business model and our job is to provide those a fee plan in the US and Europe which is fixed to the dealers which we think is attractive in reducing their average trade cost as they increase their volumes through the system and ensure that we’re providing the right technology. Each dealer has a different interaction model with their various segments of clients, some traditional, some automated with some intervention and then some quite frankly fully automated. We think the trend towards interaction via APIs will continue and we are optimistic that as the community assesses their expenses, their overall level of margin that there will be a continued move especially in the flow business to the platform.
Rick McVey: I think by way of reminder Daniel, those trends were clearly evident in the first half of this year and I think we felt better than ever before in our business history with the acceleration of share gains taking place electronically on MarketAxess during the first six months of 2007. And as you look at the detailed numbers from the third quarter that we provided this morning, it’s clear that the extreme dislocation in the short-end of the market was primarily responsible for the drop that we had in market share. We believe that this will be a temporary change in the electronic market and the long-term trends that we are observing in the first half of this year will return on a medium to long-term basis.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Thanks for that Rick and Kelly. I just actually want to turn over to the other side of the business from the client perspective. You guys, thanks for the disclosure. You talked about the OMS impact from volumes and so if you guys are currently getting around 20% of your total trade through an OMS, can you give us more color what percent of clients are actively using an OMS with you guys? What I am trying to get at is, of the clients using the OMS trading more than those that don’t today? And how long does it take to get slotted into a client’s OMS platform?
Rick McVey: An important thing to remember is that the clients that we have integrated under Order Management Systems tend to be the larger fixed income investors and as we’ve said before, we think given the concentration of assets and the fixed income investment management industry, the top 200 or 250 investors in each region account for a large majority in the institutional trading volume. So we are pleased with the progress that we are making because most of those connections are going in to large investors. The time that it takes really depends on what type of Order Management Systems that they have used. We have partnership deals with five or six of the leading Order Management System providers and once the client upgrades to the latest version that includes the connectivity to MarketAxess, then the work is done for them and their electronic access to the system is immediate. We think almost half of the US investors are operating on their own Order Management solution and that can take us a little bit more time to complete the connectivity work, but we have been successful in virtually every case where the client has been ready to make the investment in connecting to us.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. That’s helpful. Then Jim just lastly, a little bit of clean-up here, I think you mentioned that you see the tax rate moving back to 40% longer term, I mean, obviously we saw big changes this quarter given Europe’s strength versus the US, do you think that that change back to 40% happens because the US will grow faster than Europe or for other reasons?
Jim Rucker: There are really two factors driving my view on a long term tax rate, Daniel, just to be clear, this quarter the issue, what it is all about the percentage about net income that came from the European business as compared to the US business. Part of my view is that mix is changing to a slightly more normal level and without going into too much detail, some issues with the UK taxes, that means that the all-in rate that we pay on net income in the UK will increase a little bit. So, it is the combination of those two factors that drives my view that next year we will revert to a more normal tax rate of somewhere around 40%.
Daniel Harris - Goldman Sachs: I appreciate the color Jim, thanks a lot.
Jim Rucker: Thank you, Daniel.
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Rick McVey: Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for joining in today’s conference, you may now disconnect and have a wonderful day. Happy Halloween.
