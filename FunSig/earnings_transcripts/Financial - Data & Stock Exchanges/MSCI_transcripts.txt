===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-22 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MSCI Inc. first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. We will have further instructions for you. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Business Relationship and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Inc. first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2025. This press release, along with an earnings presentation and brief quarterly update, are available on our website, msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements which are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made, are based on current expectations and current economic conditions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-Ks and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the equivalent GAAP measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss operating metrics such as run rate and retention rate. Important information regarding our use of operating metrics, such as run rate and retention rate, are available in the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO, Baer Pettit, our President and COO, and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Lastly, we wanted to remind our analysts to ask one question at this time during the Q&A portion of our call. We do encourage you to ask more questions by adding yourselves back to the queue. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Good day, everyone. And thank you for joining us. I apologize for the scratchy voice. I suffer from seasonal allergies at this time of the year. In the first quarter, MSCI Inc. delivered strong financial metrics, including organic revenue growth of 10%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 11%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of almost 14%. We also repurchased $275 million worth of MSCI Inc. shares during Q1 and through April 21st. As always, the share repurchases affirm our belief in the current and future value of our stock and our commitment to a robust capital allocation policy. Our first quarter operating metrics showed durable retention and asset-based fee revenue growth, although new recurring subscription sales were down from Q1 of 2024. More specifically, MSCI Inc. delivered a retention rate of over 95%, organic subscription run rate growth of 8%, and asset-based fee growth revenue of 18%. This reflected strong growth in both ETF and non-ETF AUM linked to MSCI Inc. indices, including the highest Q1 cash flows into ETF products linked to MSCI Inc. indices since 2021. Among our client segments, we had a strong quarter with hedge funds, asset owners, banks and broker-dealers, and wealth managers. At the product level, we achieved retention rates of over 96% in index and over 95% in analytics. We also drove recurring net new sales growth of over 60% for each of these product lines. MSCI Inc. is providing a growing mix of solutions for portfolio customization and personalization. We have built solid momentum in custom indices, which will be further supported by our integration of Foxbury's F9 platform. Meanwhile, net new recurring subscription sales in private capital solutions grew by 24%. We continue building new solutions to help clients diversify into private assets. Yesterday, we announced a very exciting partnership with Moody's to develop independent credit risk assessments for private credit. By combining Moody's credit risk modeling solutions with MSCI Inc.'s private credit investment data, we will drive greater clarity and confidence in this asset class, especially at a period of credit stress in the world. MSCI Inc. has the capabilities and the business model to weather periods of global turmoil. Periods of market disruption have always been when MSCI Inc.'s clients need us the most. These are the moments when MSCI Inc.'s standards and solutions take on much greater importance for clients across segments, not just our benchmark indices and risk analytics, but also the full range of our integrated interconnected tools and content. 88% of our subscription run rates come from clients who use multiple MSCI Inc. product clients. We provide mission-critical data models and technology that clients need in all environments and all phases of the business cycle, but especially in periods of high uncertainty, low clarity, and relative volatility in markets. This enables MSCI Inc.'s all-weather franchise, robust cash flows, and fortress balance sheet, and all of that makes us confident in our ability to deliver consistent financial results amidst the current market turmoil. And with that, let me turn over the call over to Baer Pettit.
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss our first quarter performance by client segment, including meaningful business wins that give us conviction in our global strategy. We delivered encouraging results among established and newer segments. Among hedge funds, MSCI Inc. achieved 14% subscription run rate growth driven by analytics and index, and covering a wide range of products and capabilities including customization and the reimagining of risk. For example, our next-gen factor models and analytics are helping a growing number of hedge funds understand the key fact amid high levels of market volatility. We now have more than 60 hedge funds using those models, up from just 8 in 2022. We also completed a significant multi-region hedge fund deal for our ETF-linked custom index module. Amongst banks and broker-dealers, delivered over 9% subscription run rate growth with strong analytics, new recurring subscription sales in Europe and the Americas. In particular, we saw robust demand for our factor models related solutions, confirming the importance of our risk analytics tools during periods of market volatility. We also saw strong demand for custom baskets created with MSCI Inc. Index Solutions, another sign of the growing push for customization. In addition, completed a multiyear deal with a large bank in the Americas for a sustainability and climate regulatory solution that can support asset liability management. This last win demonstrated that MSCI Inc. can generate enormous value across climate risk and sustainable finance. Turning to wealth managers, we achieved subscription run rate growth of 15% driven by index across all regions and by sustainability and climate in Europe. For example, we landed a large MSCI Inc. win including index and private capital solutions, with the wealth arm of a prominent global financial institution. This win came as part of a seven-figure multilocation renewal deal that spans seven countries and broadened the scope of an existing client relationship, resulting in a client run rate expansion of almost 38%. In the process, we fully displaced the equity benchmarks of two key competitors. We also secured a large multiyear sustainability climate win with the European wealth manager to expand their integration of sustainability at both the home office level and in client portfolios. Meanwhile, direct indexing AUM based on MSCI Inc. indexes increased by 30% to more than $131 billion. All of this illustrates how MSCI Inc.'s wealth solutions cut across product lines and meet different use cases for a growing number of clients. Moving on to asset owners, we delivered subscription run rate growth of 12% driven by analytics and private capital solutions. Notably, we achieved 10% run rate growth among asset owners in analytics and with particular strength in the Americas. We also completed several large private capital solutions deals with pension funds in the Americas and Europe. These deals helped us drive 24% recurring net new sales growth in the overall PCS product line. Additionally, asset owners and other clients continue to adapt MSCI Inc. indexes to support their climate strategies. In Q1, assets under management in ETF and non-ETF products linked to MSCI Inc. climate indexes grew by 50%, reaching $387 billion in total. Finally, shifting to asset managers, our subscription run rate growth remained steady at around 5% driven by index. We achieved a retention rate of 96% with asset managers in Q1, up from 95% a year earlier. In our most notable business win, we completed a seven-figure index deal with the asset management arm of a major European bank who made MSCI Inc. their exclusive partner and index provider for all future passive ETFs. This deal also included access to our fixed income issuance weighted module and our fixed income custom index. Looking ahead, MSCI Inc. is redoubling our product development efforts to meet asset managers' rapidly evolving needs, especially around active ETFs and fixed income. In summary, MSCI Inc.'s increasingly diversified portfolio of clients, products, and services strengthen our all-weather franchise. And with that, let me turn the call over to Andy. Thank you, Baer. And hello, everyone. In these times, our global frameworks must have content and trusted risk and performance tools are essential for understanding and navigating markets. And our relationships with the world's leading investment institutions are deeper than ever, positioning us to help them navigate global markets. With 98% recurring revenue, strong margins, and high cash flow conversion, we have a highly resilient financial model that positions us for strength in all environments. In index, subscription run rate growth was 9%, with asset managers growing nearly 7% and asset owners growing over 10%. These two client segments comprise almost 70% of our index subscription run rate. An index subscription run rate growth with hedge funds, wealth managers, and banks and broker-dealers was 22%, 16%, and 11%, respectively. Please note that beginning this quarter, our investor slides will show a slightly different presentation of our index subscription run rate. This new categorization, which now breaks out the run rate across market cap weighted products, non-market cap weighted products, and custom index products, is intended to provide better insights into the growth dynamics across key offerings, especially the custom index offerings. The most notable change from the prior categorization is that the run rate from special packages is now primarily included in the market cap weighted category. In non-market cap weighted run rate primarily includes our standard factor, sustainability, and climate modules, which span both equities and fixed income offering. As you can see in our presentation, subscription run rate growth from custom index was 15%. Asset-based fee revenue grew 18%, aided by stronger flows into international exposure products, an area where MSCI Inc. has particular strength. Non-ETF AUM linked to MSCI Inc. indexes nearly $3.9 trillion, growing 20% year over year. MSCI Inc. linked equity ETFs had an ending balance of $1.78 trillion at the end of March after attracting nearly $42 billion of inflows. $37 billion of the inflows went into products linked to MSCI Inc. DMX US, EM, and all country exposures. Categories where MSCI Inc. collectively captured roughly 45% of all inflows. These cash flows represent the second strongest quarter since 2022, behind only Q4 of last year. Our strong asset-based fee growth also benefited from growth in fixed income index products. Fixed ETF AUM linked to MSCI Inc. and partner indexes is now over $76 billion, growing 20% from a year ago. In analytics, subscription run rate growth was 7%, reflecting continued momentum in equity analytics and solid growth with hedge funds, trading firms, and asset owners. Similar to last quarter, we expect analytics revenue growth to be in line with to slightly lower than run rate growth in Q2 as we compare to periods last year when we had meaningful contributions from implementation-related revenues. In our sustainability and climate reportable segment, previously referred to as the ESG and climate segment, we drove almost 10% subscription run rate growth, reflecting some large deals in banking that we previously spoke about supported by 14% growth with both asset owners and wealth managers. Our long-term target for this product line remains under review, as we assess the impact of the near-term environment on the long-term trajectory. That said, we're seeing traction on several fronts, including with our geospatial asset intelligence solutions where we've had several recent wins. The retention rate of 94.5% for the segment highlights that our sustainability and climate tools remain mission-critical. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we will be lapping the prior year benefit from the Moody's partnership, which had a significant contribution to last year's sustainability and climate new recurring sales. Private capital solutions saw a 24% increase in recurring net new sales and continued mid-teens growth of our run rate, reflecting steady interest in our data, performance, and benchmarking solutions. Real assets, overall activity remain muted. We continue to face headwinds related to client consolidation, particularly among brokers and developers. On the capital allocation front, we've repurchased over $275 million of MSCI Inc. stock or over 493,000 shares since the start of the year. This reflects our opportunistic approach to capital deployment and our belief in the long-term value of the franchise. We have a strong balance sheet with our gross leverage ratio now at 2.6 times the last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. Our guidance is unchanged. In this complex operating environment, we are preparing MSCI Inc. to navigate a broad range of possible outcomes. As we mentioned last quarter, our guidance assumed that market levels gradually increased throughout the year. To the extent markets remain at their current levels, we would expect expenses to be at the low end of our current guidance ranges. As a reminder, we have various expense playbook levers that we can rapidly flex. These include but are not limited to managing the pace of hiring, flexing non-comp and professional fees. Additionally, our incentive comp remains self-adjusting with overall financial performance. Our Q1 effective tax rate of 12.8% reflected the benefit of significant discrete items as we previously indicated. Beyond Q1, we expect the quarterly effective tax rate excluding potential discrete items to be in the range of 19% to 21% each quarter for the rest of 2025. Our Q1 performance adds to our track record of consistent, durable financial results. The long-term secular opportunities remain intact. We remain laser-focused on anticipating the needs of the investment community as market conditions evolve. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. I wanted to ask about just the selling environment. It looked like in periods of market volatility, I feel like retention typically is strong and we saw that this quarter. But I guess I wanted to focus more on sort of new sales. So particularly maybe index and sustainability. You know, I guess, what are you hearing from clients in terms of conversations? Is there a little bit of reluctance to make new purchases? Are any deals sort of getting pushed out? And just wanted to understand if there was any change in the market environment, particularly maybe towards the end of the quarter. Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Hi, Toni. Baer here. So look, I want to be very measured in my comments. So the first one, which I think is self-evident, is this is an extremely uncertain environment with new news coming every day on a variety of market topics. If we then go more specifically and narrowly to our clients and our day-to-day activities, you know, as of today, we don't have evidence that there is a change in the purchase clients. More specifically, a few items that did not close in Q1, again, as of today, we believe they will close in Q2. You know, that information could change in the coming weeks, but as of today, you know, we believe that some of those items that didn't close in Q1 will close in Q2. Our pipeline is in decent shape. Our levels of client engagement are high. And, notably, a few observations. There's a clear demand among clients for transparency, analytics, and stress testing in the current environment. There's an emphasis on opportunities outside the US from a number of clients in all geographies. And so those are some of the key things. So we are not seeing a dramatic change. We are in constant contact with our clients at all levels of the organization from the sales force to Henry and myself. And we hope we can navigate this with our important mission-critical tools.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask in terms of your comment on your preparing for a wide range of outcomes, maybe just, you know, remind us, you know, kind of of that downturn playbook that you've talked about many times before, but you know, with just a little bit more context on, you know, perhaps you know, those outcomes you're referring to in this environment?
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. And as you know, we continually calibrate the pace of spend based on not only the market levels but business performance and opportunities that we see. And so if markets improve, we will flex up. And similarly, if markets turn down, we have the levers to manage our expenses down. Just to be a little bit more specific about those levers that we have if we need to use them. You've got incentive compensation, which adjusts naturally with the outlook for the business and overall business performance. A 10% swing in the performance relative to our targets has an annual impact of about $20 million just to dimension how much that can swing. There are certain non-comp expenses that we can flex, delaying professional fees, flexing other non-comp items, that can collectively have an annualized impact of about $20 million, and those can start to impact expenses within a quarter or two, so relatively quickly. And then we can control the pace of hiring. Usually takes a couple quarters to start to have an impact on the financial results. But that similarly can have about a $20 million annual impact if we flex hiring up or down on the year. And so we can even calibrate more or less, obviously, on all those levers. And so it's a continual calibration. As we had said before, our guidance assumed that markets gradually increase throughout the year. If the market levels remain relatively flat through the year, we will be towards the low end or at the low end of our expense guidance ranges. We wanted to give you that color just to calibrate how much the market would impact overall expenses. But it is important to highlight that there are many factors that feed into the pace of expenses beyond just the market levels and AUM levels, but we also look at business opportunities, financial performance, and potential investment traction that we're getting in key areas. So it's something that we'll continue to calibrate based on the outlook. We'll keep you posted. But we're confident that we have a very strong financial model here in the leverage to deliver strong results in all environments.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, Andy.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey. Hello, everyone. Just wanted to come back to the selling environment and in particular, wanna ask about, you know, international investing. I mean, it seems to be the first time in a long time that people are talking about, you know, asset flows not towards the US, towards international markets, which seems fairly new. So given that most of your indices are on subscription sites internationally focused, just wondering if you're starting to see a change at all in terms of investor or customer sentiment. So if more assets are flowing into, let's say, Europe or away from the US, how would we think about maybe, you know, a pickup in your business? Not on the ETF side, but more on the subscription side, like, would you expect more fund launches? Anything you can see already, or is it just way too early? But just trying to think about this as a new trend in a long time, how this could actually impact your business. Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: Well, thanks for that question, Alex. Definitely, we're seeing a marked change in everything you're talking about. This obviously accelerated with the tariffs, but it was already ongoing from the beginning of the year. In which a lot of our global clients, including US clients, in their global portfolios, were already placing a lot of bets on Europe and Japan. And given the decline in interest rates and obviously the weakening of the dollar, we also saw flows going into emerging markets and new inflows into emerging markets. As I said, that accelerated meaningfully since April 2nd. And when you look at our business, we have done relatively well against in the last two, three years relative to strong headwinds for us because a lot of first of all, our breakdown in subscription run rate is about 40% Americas, 40% Europe, and or EMEA, and 20% Asia Pacific. So we are not and that is where the client is located. But at the end, our business is predicated on global investing. And if there is a massive amount of money flowing into the US market, it's a headwind for us. And that's what was happening in the last couple of two, three years. That trend is reversing significantly. I know, in the last month or so, I've had 70 to 80 CEO level meetings through our role of Europe and Asia, which I just came back. And you could see palpable that shift. So that hopefully will benefit us on a relative sense because we were having this headwind for a long period of time. Would clearly benefit the asset-based fee. Remember, most of our asset-based fees are based on exposures that are outside of the US. And then we translate them into dollars. So we may get two benefits, better relative performance of assets outside of the US compared to the US. And secondly, depreciation of the dollar. So that may benefit us there. And on the subscription side, clearly, the active managers, the pension funds, and all of that will do that. But I want to amplify my answer here to say these are periods in which people need a lot more data. To understand the underlying issues of portfolios, whether it's index data or transparency data for private assets, or ESG data, sustainability data, climate data, they want to understand what's going on. This geospatial location product that we have is enormously valuable to now people trying to assess who are the companies that are gonna get more impacted or less impacted by trade wars? Because we have location or manufacturing plans per company, locations of where they're selling the products and all of that. So that hopefully can give us a lot of benefit in there. These are times in which people need a lot of models. To understand stress testing, scenario planning, scenario what if this, what if that. Factor decomposition. There is a major shift that will go on into a value company, a growth company, a momentum company, a quality company, and all of that. So we're seeing significant dialogue going on with our clients with respect to a lot of that. And as I said, the transparency. So if you think about private assets, it's important to know that in an environment like this, we're not counting on a lot of money going into private assets. That will be icing on the cake. We're counting on the current investors in private assets wanting much more transparency of what's going on in their portfolio and that's where we come in. For in private credit, for example, with the potential of slowdowns or recessions around the world, especially US, Europe, people who wanna know what's underneath my private credit portfolio. So we have a database of 2,800 private credit funds that have about 14,000 companies. We have terms and conditions in those private credit funds. And now we have, with this partnership with Moody's, we will have credit assessment on that. So that's another example of the benefits we can get in this environment. And again, we're not savoring this environment. We're not we say we don't deserve it. But in an environment like this, this is where MSCI Inc. comes at its best. Right?
Operator: Thank you. One moment before our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC.
Ashish Sabadra: Thank you for your question. I just wanted to focus on the pricing. I was just wondering if you could comment on how the pricing is trending both for renewals and for new sales. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. So I would say across the firm in the first quarter, the percent contribution from pricing increases to new recurring sales was roughly in line with the contribution we saw a year ago. That is slightly lower than what we saw in 2023. It does vary a bit across product lines and client segments, but in most areas, I'd say price increases were roughly comparable to last year. It's important to keep in mind here that price increases are not just like-for-like increases. We are oftentimes providing our clients with enhancements to the existing solutions, broader access, broader usage in addition to continuing to provide enhanced client service. So all of those things factor into our approach to pricing. And we do also look at client health and the overall pricing environment as inputs as well. And there are definitely areas where we could push price more, but we are very focused on being a very strong partner to our clients as we said before. And as Henry alluded to in these environments, we have the opportunity to do more with organizations and help them in these times. And so we factor that in the overall pricing equation as well.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.
Owen Lau: Thank you for taking my questions. I want to go back to the new sales environment. And you mentioned that some deals are pushed out from the first quarter to the second quarter. But you are still cautiously optimistic that you can sign them in the second quarter. So could you please provide more color on under what circumstances that they will proceed with the deal? Do they need to see the escalation of the trade war? If this trade war or if this tariff narrative drags on for another quarter, do you think they will still sign the deal?
Baer Pettit: Thanks, Owen. Yeah, look. I think it's really not so much in the context of the trade war, honestly. I think it's just much more kind of in quote normal business. So in the sense that, look, sometimes some quarters we get a lot of things at the very last minute. Sometimes things get bumped. We had a few larger deals that didn't make it this past quarter. I was actually personally involved in some of those. So I think I don't want to link it less to the environment, in the sense that, you know, my overall observation was one, we are not for the moment seeing anything unusual. Our clients are cautious. There's a lot of uncertainty. But on the day-to-day level of what's going on with our clients in terms of, let's say, a deal not making it from one quarter to the next, you know, the evidence shows that those things will close based on what we know today. So my main point is really to say that as of today, we're not really seeing a big change in the environment. We're not being told by clients that the environment will mean they do not do something. And so in that sense, my emphasis is on continuity. In what we're doing, continuity at our client talks, but the background is this uncertainty. So, you know, a lot can happen in the next months, during the course of this quarter. But as of right now, we are not seeing the volatility affect specific deals that we have in the pipeline right now.
Owen Lau: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hess from JPMorgan.
Alex Hess: Hi, everybody. Baer, Andy, could you potentially comment on how AUM has trended in the non-ETF part of your business overall? I saw that was at some pretty healthy growth in the quarter. If you could just sort of elaborate as to what is driving your growth there and what your expectations are for the balance of the year, you know, up 27% by my math to just under $50 million on a quarterly basis. It's surely a big step up for you guys. It'd be helpful to know, you know, what we should be looking for there and, you know, maybe what's driving it. Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Hi, Alex. Yeah. So we did firstly, it's important to keep in mind that there can be a little bit of lumpiness in revenue in the non-ETF passive category related to true-ups and true-downs just when we get the updated assets reported to clients. If you look at the underlying AUM, we do see pretty healthy growth there. So non-ETFs average AUM was up around 20% in the quarter compared to a year ago. We saw pretty healthy growth of new fund creation. We even saw that particularly in areas like climates and custom mandates. And so we continue to be encouraged about the opportunity. A couple of areas to note here. We commented in the prepared remarks about direct indexing. So direct indexing does come through this line. While it's relatively small, it is high growth for us. And then there are areas like institutional passive, which we continue to see help the one of our indexes. And as I alluded to, that's increasingly against custom index. Is, and that's a place where we are differentiated. We think we can be a helpful partner to clients, and we do see pretty stable economics there. And so average basis points have been quite resilient across non-ETF passive on the heels of our non-market cap and custom index type of mandate. So, yeah, it's an area that we are focused heavily on. It's very strategic out there.
Alex Hess: And just in case it wasn't clear, I did mean to ask for end of period AUM for the non-ETF business. Sorry about that.
Andy Wiechmann: Yeah. No problem. End of period AUM and non-ETF passive was around $3.9 trillion.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on retention rates, particularly on the index side and analytics. And if I look at those, it seems like they were pretty normal relative to the historical trend. If I look back to 2022 and 2023, over time potentially from, you know, consolidation with European F know, these levels as more normal from here or if there's, you know, additional impacts that you're expecting related to just the current environment or, you know, more generally anything else that you're expecting?
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. So maybe just to provide a bit more color on the retention rate in the quarter, and then we can talk about some of the dynamics looking forward here. But if we look at Q1 of this year compared to Q1 of last year, we had lower cancels across most client segments, and we had notable declines in cancels with hedge funds and banks compared to a year ago, which probably is not surprising if you remember we had the large cancel related to the large global bank merger in the first quarter of last year, and we had some elevated hedge fund events in the first quarter of last year. And so we saw a nice rebound in retention among those client segments. But to your point, we saw pretty healthy retention in our largest product segments. So within index, it was 96.5%, and within analytics, 95.5%. And from a client segment standpoint, we saw a retention rate of about 96% with asset managers, and north of 95% with asset owners. And so, you know, the core part of the business saw some pretty healthy resilience in the quarter. The top cause of cancels continues to be client events, and I think the comments that I made last quarter around, you know, some caution particularly in Europe still holds. I think when we look forward this year, it's possible we could see some lumpiness in cancels in certain periods, particularly if the market uncertainty continues and that recent volatility continues, which can lead to some elevated client events. But it's important to keep in mind that our tools really are mission-critical here. And as Henry alluded to, they're must-have solutions in these types of environments. But we were encouraged by the retention here, but a bit cautious on the outlook for the balance of the year.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous.
Kelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on analytics, I think you previously highlighted that in a period of high volatility and uncertainty, analytics would generally see stronger growth. I'm not sure we've really seen this in Q1 that new sales numbers. But under the current environment, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about growth expectations for analytics new sales in Q2 and the rest of the year.
Henry Fernandez: So first of all, you know, Q1 was not yet a period of significant turmoil or uncertainty. If anything, there was a little bit at least part of the Q1, there was a little bit of the carryover of the excitement of the new US administration and the risk on trades that took place. So I would not read too much on that Q1 being a period of difficulty. Clearly, things started to get a little more to deteriorate in the latter part of Q1 and then obviously, you know, in April. So in periods like this, there are two big periods like this. You know, and especially this one, there are a little bit of three different forces that will shape our sales and our growth and all of that. Right? The first force is client need us the most. Client needs more data, they need more stress testing, factor decomposition, they need more understanding of what is inside an index, they need better transparency with private assets and all of that because they wanna know what's underneath the hood of all their investments. Right? And therefore, that will be a very significant positive. Especially in risk analytics, and in our index offering, which is the largest part of MSCI Inc. Right? In periods like this also there the not in periods like this. In this particular period, there is a significant reallocation of assets to non-US markets. With a consequent, you know, declining of the dollar, and, you know, we're booing, you know, Japan and Europe and other places like that. And we're seeing that. And that again is another positive compared to what, the last complete two, three years was a massive influence to the US market. So on balance, we do much better when money flows around the world than just to the US market. Those two very significant positives need to be weighed against the spending of our clients, you know, the budgets of our clients in which there's some clients that are doing well, you know, a lot of equity long-term hedge funds will do well. Micro hedge funds will do well. Pension funds are typically very steady. You know, the index fund managers are gonna do well. You know, active managers may be may not do as well, but some of them if there is a period in which active management should be very brilliant, it's this period. So some of those active managers are gonna do well, and their budgets are not gonna be curtailed. But others may be curtailed. So I think that you know, we need to put those three factors into the equation. How much of the two positives outweigh the negative of potential lesser spending by our clients or vice versa? And we don't know the answer to that until we go through the whole period. Right?
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel from Wolfe Research.
Scott Wurtzel: Great. Thank you guys for taking my question. Wanted to ask on the sustainability and climate segment just in terms of the acceleration and run rate growth that we've seen this quarter along with it sounds like some relatively large deals being signed. Just wondering if you think we're maybe seeing a potential inflection point in that segment and that we could potentially see acceleration and growth down the line here. Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: So there's no question that sustainability, you know, the old ESG is on a cyclical headwind. We continue to believe that on a secular structural basis, factors related to sustainability and understanding the inside of portfolios will be positive. And will return to higher growth the demand is also changing. You know, the demand that we have was largely ESG ratings. People will take our ESG rating. They trust us what we did. They didn't wanna look under the hood, and they went out and created portfolios on that. Now people say, yeah. I would love to take your ESG rating, but I wanna see the underlying information. I wanna break it down into the various environmental sections, the social sectors, and all of that. So the demand is changing, and therefore, we're gearing up to that change in demand, which is a lot more underlying data, which is actually very positive for us. Because we have all of that just a question of how do we package it and how we sell it. You know, the other change in the demand is major regulatory burden. So a lot of our clients who have portfolios on sustainability or are launching sustainability, they want a lot more help in complying with every one of these regulations all over the world. And we have packages that help them do that in an automatic fashion. So now the last piece is that you know, bear in mind that in order for us to get to sustainability, we gather an enormous amount of information about our clients' operations. Where the employees, where they're located, you know, their offices, their hiring practices, and their controversies, their this, and all of that. So that database becomes very valuable also to examine other issues, not just sustainability, but other issues. So that's something that can pick up in demand. Now on climate, you know, which is climate demand and factors are and variables are gonna gradually be very separate than the other part of sustainability, what we call ESG. Right? We used to call ESG. So on climate, you know, it's not going away. You know, but the demand is also changing. It's going from long-term, long-dated transition risk in pools of assets that were long-dated, such as pension funds, over wealth funds, and all of that, and on transition, net zero commitments, and how to get there, and all of that, that continues, but the bigger demand is now in the front end in physical risk with the banks and insurance companies wanting to do that. So that's why, you know, our partnership with the Swiss Re on physical risk models is part of going in that climate direction. You know, as I said, I just spent three months on the road, five straight weeks at a time for ten weeks altogether, and I met with 70, 80 CEOs. I didn't see anybody stepping away from the climate risk issues. Now, you know, in an environment like this, is that the first thing they're gonna do? Probably not because they need to survive in the short term before they make it to the medium term. So climate risk is hitting these people really hard especially banks and insurance companies, you know, and we see it all over the world. You know, the physical risk has increased. So we're hopeful that after a period of maybe softness, you know, on climate, that things begin to pick up. One notable example, one notable area that we're doing a lot of work particularly with the European asset owners, is taking a climate risk overlay on fixed income portfolios so we're delivering climate-adjusted fixed income indices for this asset owner clients to reallocate their fixed income portfolios in this direction. I hope that helps.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners, LLC.
Craig Huber: Yes. Hi. Thank you. My question around ESG is there a material difference in the year-over-year growth rate in the quarter we just finished here by region Europe versus Asia versus the Americas? Maybe also if you could touch on the climate growth within ESG how those revenues did year over year, that piece of it, please.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Hi, Craig. So there was a difference. So the subscription run rate growth for sustainability and climate in EMEA was about 14%. That was 4% in the Americas and 8.5% in APAC. And those regions contribute about 52% from EMEA, 34% Americas, and 14% in the APAC region. Climate run rate growth was 20% across the entire company, within the sustainability and climate segment. It was about 17% growth. And just to dimension that, the climate-related run rate within the sustainability climate segment is around $75, $76 million.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas from Wells Fargo.
Jason Haas: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I was curious if you could talk about why the first quarter EBITDA expenses came in below your expectations.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Well, we see a number of, as we've talked about before, lumpy expenses in the first quarter. Those are heavily related to compensation and benefits-related expenses. And we have other expenses that tend to be a bit elevated around year-end. And so just the ultimate magnitude of those and the timing of those can cause some swings in the expenses in the quarter. Importantly, as you saw, we have not changed our guidance for the year. And so we're kind of on assuming the market's gradually increase for the year, the expense trajectory is on track for those expense guide ranges as we alluded to, we are being cautious since the extent markets remain flat. Or go down. We will calibrate accordingly. But because expenses are kind of in the first quarter, we're on the trajectory, which we expected.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to dig into the sales, the gross sales that didn't close in Q1 that you guys are hoping will close in Q2. It sounds like some of those could be meaningful. Guess I'm wondering, were those concentrated within any segment? It looks like index was definitely a little bit lower. Was a lot of that in there or any other detail you could give us would be helpful.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So look, this has come up a few times. I want to reiterate that my key point related to this is that this is kind of what I would call normal sales activity in a given quarter where certain deals either make it or don't make it. Right? So my emphasis is not so much on these deals in the context of change, but more to say, look, we had a few deals that didn't make it. We think we were gonna make it in the second quarter. Rather than that there's something special about them or unusual or what have you. So I think the long story short is they're across a number of different product lines, they were literally across all of our product lines. Some of the larger what are few of the larger deals that didn't quite make it. So I think it's kind of dangerous category to go too much into the detail, and I think it's important to elevate the point to the higher level that I was trying to get to, which is look, some deals didn't make it, which can happen in any given quarter. But in the slightly changed circumstances since then, we're not seeing evidence that those deals will now not close. I.e., rapidly changing environment, more uncertainty, but our belief and understanding with our client engagement is that those deals that didn't make it in Q1 will make it in Q2 and we hope that to be the case.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America Securities.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. I wanted to ask about the new Moody's partnership. Can you provide a little bit more color on how that came about and just maybe how you're thinking about it impacting your growth rate? I'm assuming it's gonna show up in private asset that private asset segment.
Henry Fernandez: Yeah. So we started quite a number of years ago. We had gone to the senior management of Moody's and said to them, we have a number of highly complementary capabilities. Why don't we try to do some partnerships? And at the time, it was very focused on ESG. And we said to them instead of you running a whole ESG business, why don't you rely on us and you feed the ESG data and models and ratings into your entire business? And so a couple of years ago, they came back and said, you know, that makes a lot of sense rather than us doing that. So why don't we do that? And that culminated in the partnership that we announced on ESG last summer. On the success of that, working relationship and partnership, we started talking about what are other things that we can do that one plus one is three so that they don't have to replicate what we do and we don't replicate what we do. And then we started focusing on private credit. So that started last July. So we went through a number of iterations as to what were the areas that we could potentially benefit mutually from private credit, and eventually settled on using their flagship probability of default models and apply it to MSCI Inc.'s database of private credit and models. Of another risk models to come up with a third-party significant assessment of creditworthiness of the private credit funds. And the underlying instruments, the underlying holdings of those private credit funds. So it's significant because we have some probability of default models, but they're not definitely at the scale of Moody's. Moody's has databases, but our database is superior to their private credit database. So we joined forces to do that together so that we can present a joint product to the market. We're gonna market it across all of our analytical platforms. And our client basis. They're gonna market it in their own client basis, analytical platforms. And, obviously, third-party platforms. So it's a win-win. For that. And on the heels of that, second partnership, which obviously we announced yesterday, we're talking about what other partnerships. Are there things that we can do on climate? They have incredible things on incredible models on climate, physical models and other kinds of models, and we have obviously models. We're very strong in transition risk. They're stronger in physical risk. We obviously have this other partnership on physical risk with Swiss Re. They have a lot of real estate database. We have a lot of real estate database, and we have a lot of other private they have their own Orbit database. We have our own investment database. So can we do things? So in a nutshell, instead of them trying to replicate what we do, to come up with new products and we're also replicating what they do, we partner up to benefit from each other's capabilities. That's a little bit of the process that we've gone through.
Andy Wiechmann: And Josh, it will show up in the private asset segment, although it would highlight that the financial impact this year is likely gonna be immaterial. Relatively small.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to sustainability and climate. Was the only segment to see net new sale decline in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about the factors behind that and when you might expect that new sales to inflect to growth? And maybe in what kind of environment that would be most likely to happen.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. So George, and you can see this in the retention rate, which was relatively solid in the quarter. As Henry alluded to, clients are committed to sustainability and climate is very topical and a big focus area for them. We are seeing muted demand in areas. Needless to say, it's a very nuanced and dynamic landscape. But we are seeing subdued demand particularly in the US where investors remain cautious about launching sustainability strategies and funds. And even in Europe, we've seen some regulatory complexity that we've talked about in the past and some uncertainty persist. There is the potential for reduced scope on CSRD. Which is small for us today. Very small for us today, but obviously, was an opportunity for us that's looking less likely. And so our tools remain absolutely mission-critical. To clients, but there is some caution and some headwinds which we're likely to see in the near term here. So we expect the performance in the next couple quarters to be similar to what we've seen in recent quarters. As Henry alluded to earlier, we continue to be bullish about the long-term opportunity here. We are seeing investors evolve on the climate front from emissions into physical risk. We see investors broaden their thinking around sustainability into resilience and really double-clicking into all aspects of risk related to sustainability. And that's an area where we've always been differentiated and are very well positioned. And so there are these attractive opportunities, areas within climate where we're getting early traction. I think some of the broader cyclical dynamics are gonna persist here in the short term, but over the long term, we continue to be focused on the big opportunities in front of us.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic.
Russell Quelch: Thank you. Good morning. Perhaps as a follow-up to an earlier question on retention, can I quickly check that the improvement in Q1 was driven by a lapping of one-off client consolidations and not due to proactive actions on pricing or discounting?
Andy Wiechmann: So well, comparing the retention rate to Q1 of last year, obviously, Q1 of last year, we saw a lower retention rate related to that client activity that I talked about with banks. And hedge funds particularly. I'd say the retention rate was reasonably strong across all segments for us here, and I'd say I wouldn't attribute that to any one thing in specific other than the broad mission-criticality of our tools, our proactive client engagement and client service efforts, and our strong position relative to competitors in the market. So I wouldn't say it necessarily is tied to pricing. But if you compare to last year, obviously, we did have some elevated client events in the first quarter of last year, which is why you saw a big increase year over year.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Simpson from BNP Paribas Exane.
Gregory Simpson: Hi there. I just wanted to ask for a bit more color on private capital solutions, which had 15% run rate growth this quarter, and in particular, how the sales and uptake of the suite of private capital indexes you launched last year have been going. Just feel like there should be a lot of demand for transparency, private markets in this kind of backdrop, but also where it's a bit of competition in the space. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: So private capital solutions formerly the Burgess, right, the Burgess acquisition that we made at the moment is largely a product offering transparency to institutional investors, institutional LPs, on their investments in GPs. Across the whole spectrum of private assets. There are a lot of other sales that are for entities related to that ecosystem. And therefore, the market that we have we have over 1,000 institutional LPs as clients in this area. And we're fairly underpenetrated. Underpenetrated in this product line. Around the world. Especially outside of the US. And the institutional LPs understanding with a lot of transparency what is the portfolio, how is that doing relative to a benchmark, what is the performance of the portfolio, the risk of the portfolio, what are the trajectory of capital calls, of returns of capital and things like that. So we remain extremely bullish about a continuation of fairly decent growth rates around the world in this area. The second part that we are now focused on is think of them as wealth LPs. You know, or individual LPs advised by their wealth manager they are not dramatically different than an institutional LP. They are LPs. They are investors and therefore, we're gearing up to provide much higher levels of transparency to those investors in private assets. Of course, private credit is one of the biggest sellers there. And the like. That's a second area of initiative that we have. And the third one is as time goes by, we are creating more products totally fitted for the GPs. Understanding their own portfolios, comparing it to competitors' portfolios, and all of that. So far, this market is, you know, you can hear a lot of competitors here and there and all of that, but this is a market we have a very strong leadership. In it. Very strong leadership. And we are advancing on that leadership and making it bigger and wider. The benchmark indices associated with that are a compounding of that level of transparency they may not be an end in themselves. Meaning, we may not have a large amount of revenue that come from just the benchmark indices and private asset, although, you know, we're gonna try, but they wouldn't gonna be any major part of the entire transparency from performance to risk to understanding the market, which is a benchmark to the comparison to the market, etcetera, etcetera. So we're very bullish on this private capital solutions product line going forward.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I will now turn the floor over to Henry Fernandez for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, operator. I just want to reiterate that periods of global turmoil are when MSCI Inc.'s clients need us the most and where we do our best. We provide mission-critical tools for understanding key sources of investment risk and investment performance and combining both of them into portfolio construction and asset allocation across market cycles. Those tools can take an even greater relevance in high levels of volatility. This is why MSCI Inc. remains confident in the resilience and adaptability of our all-weather franchise and our ability to expand in periods like this. You know, it's not as it's you know, everyone tries to expand in bull markets and when things are going well, you know, MSCI Inc. normally expands the most. In periods like this because clients need us the most. They wanna talk to us the most and all of that. So thank you again for joining us today, listening to our story, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again soon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are requested to ask one question at a time then add themselves back to the queue for any additional questions. We will have further instructions for you later on. I would like to turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter 2024. This press release, along with an earnings presentation and brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements, which are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, are based on current expectations and current economic conditions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures. You will find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the equivalent GAAP measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss operating metrics, such as run rate and retention rate. Important information regarding our use of operating metrics, such as run rate and retention rate are available in the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Lastly, we wanted to remind our analysts to ask one question at a time during the Q&A portion of our call. We do encourage you to ask more questions by adding yourselves back to the queue. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Good day everyone and thank you for joining us. In 2024, MSCI delivered a strong financial metrics that once again demonstrated our scale and leadership in servicing the global investment ecosystem. For the full year, we achieved organic revenue growth of almost 10%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 12.4%, and free cash flow growth of 21%. We also repurchased $810 million worth of MSCI shares for the full year. During the fourth quarter and through yesterday, we repurchased over $425 million worth of MSCI shares in alignment with our shareholder centric capital allocation policy. In the fourth quarter, our operating metrics included organic subscription run rate growth of 8% excluding FX headwinds and 7% on a reported basis, asset based fee run rate growth of 15% and a retention rate of 93%. Our ABF run rate growth was driven by higher average AUM aided by the highest quarterly cash inflows into equity ETFs linked to MSCI indices since the end of 2021 at more than US$48 billion. Among client segments, we also had a strong quarter with hedge funds and wealth managers as we grew our firmwide subscription run rate growth by 15% and 12% respectively excluding FX. While active asset managers continue to face cyclical pressures, we posted 5% growth in subscription run rate excluding FX and a 94% retention rate with this segment. In my remarks today I will focus on three areas in particular that demonstrate the success of our strategy: index, wealth, and fixed income. In index products, the ecosystem linked to MSCI indices remains central to global investing and in Q4 we saw a number of milestones. Last month, for example, one of our large asset manager clients launched a new ETF linked to an MSCI climate index with a record breaking seeded investment of $2.4 billion from one of our large pension fund clients. This highlights the prominence of our indices, the network effect among our clients and the continuing demand for climate related investment products. Clients increasingly want specialized portfolio construction tools while aligning with the frameworks, classification systems and rules based methodologies that MSCI has established as standards. This has fueled demand for MSCI's custom index capabilities including the Foxberry F9 platform, which is now being fully integrated into our product suite. We also completed large index deals with two of the world's top investment banks, which Baer will discuss shortly. In the wealth segment in Q4 we achieved 12% subscription run rate growth with wealth managers excluding FX with a total wealth subscription run rate of $116 million. We also saw direct indexing AUM based on MSCI indices increased by 31% to nearly $130 billion. MSCI Wealth, a new MSCI brand, is helping wealth managers attract AUM by enabling them to build a scalable, personalized and outcome oriented portfolios. Our client engagement levels with wealth managers are now higher than ever as I have seen firsthand in meetings across Europe over the past month. MSCI's progress in wealth also reflects the benefits of our long-term investments, including in our data and technology and a laser focus on evolving client needs. In fixed income products, during the fourth quarter we drove fixed income run rate growth of 15% across all of our product lines which is now $104 million. Most notably, we completed a large, seven-figure fixed income portfolio management analytics deal with a U.S.-based asset manager, displacing a major incumbent provider. We also secure a first of its kind, federal government contract in which the client will use our agency mortgage-backed security analytics to better understand the performance and risk of this huge market. Both of these wins stem from the work we have done to enhance our fixed income capabilities, including investing in hard-to-model assets like securitized products and mortgage backed securities. Putting it all together, MSCI continues to benefit from the depth, diversification and resilience of our client, product and revenue base. To the extent market levels and fund inflows remain supportive, we believe this will support active asset manager client budgets this year. MSCI is increasingly well positioned to expand and our footprint among established and newer client segments alike. Thanks to our data, models and technology. We believe disadvantages can help us drive compounding growth across the years and across market cycles. And with that let me turn the call over to Baer. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. Greetings everyone. Given our focus on client segment growth, I'd like to use this opportunity to review our progress in the fourth quarter which highlighted the broad reach of our solutions and the underlying strength of our all-weather franchise. I will start with wealth managers where MSCI’s recent investments have helped us build significant momentum across product lines. In Q4 we achieved firm wide subscription run rate growth of 12% among wealth managers excluding FX, bringing our total subscription run rate with that segment to $116 million. We also delivered 14% subscription run rate growth among wealth managers and analytics, excluding FX, which now totals over $25 million. In addition, we closed a large enterprise deal for the MSCI Wealth Manager, formerly known as Fabric. MSCI Wealth Manager has positioned us to support a wide range of use cases including proposal generation, model portfolio construction and home office account management and monitoring. These use cases extend to ESG and Climate. In Q4 we achieved 28% climate run rate growth among wealth managers which totals $7 million. We drove 67% ESG and Climate recurring sales growth among that segment which was $3 million. Turning to hedge funds, we achieved 15% subscription run rate growth excluding FX, including our best ever Q4 recurring sales driven by 46% recurring sales growth among hedge funds index. We completed large deals with several, multi strategy hedge funds, including conversions of a one-time Float Data sales into recurring subscription deals. These conversions showcase the value of our product, as well as the growing liquidity of MSCI Index Linked products. Moving on to banks and broker dealers, we delivered 7% subscription run rate growth excluding FX across product lines with particular strength from index where new recurring sales for the segment was over $7 million in Q4, growing almost 39%. In two of our most notable index business wins, we expanded our relationships with a pair of large investment banks in the Americas. As part of these deals, the bank's trading desks will use MSCI Index data to support their origination of OTC derivatives and structured products and for Delta 1 use cases. Such examples confirm that market participants are increasingly using our content to enhance their research, risk management and alpha generation strategies. If we look at asset owners, MSCI achieved 11% subscription run rate growth, excluding FX, including almost 40% recurring sales growth in Q4 among asset owners in index. Our position among asset owners has also been strengthened by the continued importance of climate along with our burgeoning capabilities in private assets. We recently won a large climate index mandate with a UK-based asset owner, which is expected to result in $20 billion of AUM benchmarked to an MSCI Climate Index. Meanwhile, our run rate among asset owners in private capital solutions is now $78 million after growing 15% in Q4. As asset owners increase their allocations to private assets, we recently launched a new data set to support their growing interest in private credit. Our new private credit data set provides terms and conditions transparency on more than 2,800 private credit funds and more than 120,000 private credit holdings to support various due diligence and portfolio management needs. Turning finally to asset managers, we grew our firm-wide subscription run rate by 5% excluding FX headwinds, while achieving a retention rate of 94%. In analytics, we landed a large deal with an asset manager in the Americas for our fixed income portfolio attribution and fixed income factor risk tools. This deal was enabled by our new AI Portfolio Insights solution and it further endorses the multi-year investments we have made in our fixed income franchise. Another key asset manager win came with a large existing client in Europe, who expanded their use of MSCI’s managed services, data management, and enterprise risk and performance analytics. We also continue to support asset managers with tools for sustainability and the low carbon transition. Globally, we delivered a retention rate of nearly 95% among asset manager clients for our ESG and Climate product line. With asset managers in Europe, we landed numerous large ticket deals for our Nature and Biodiversity tools and for our climate scenario analysis and stress testing regulatory solutions. As you can see, our product, data and technology investments are helping us expand our footprint with a range of clients across the capital markets ecosystem. All of this supports our ability to deliver attractive top line growth and profitability. And with that, let me turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hi, everyone. I continue to be really encouraged by the resilience of our results and the momentum we're seeing across product areas. Index subscription run rate growth with asset managers and asset owners was almost 7% and 12%, respectively. These client segments comprise nearly 70% of our index subscription run rate. Among hedge funds and broker-dealers, we drove 22% and 8% index subscription run rate growth, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Custom indexes and special packages grew 8% versus last year. Within the category, our custom index subscription run rate growth was mid-teens, while we had a lower contribution from special packages. An overall retention rate and index was 95%, with a retention rate of almost 96% with asset managers. Within asset-based fees, global cash inflows into equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes was $48 billion in the quarter, with particular strength in ETFs linked to developed markets outside the U.S., ESG and climate and factors. Q4 cash inflows into ETF products linked to MSCI ESG and climate indexes reached nearly $12 billion, our highest quarterly cash inflows since the first quarter of 2022. These inflows accounted for nearly 70% of global cash inflows into ESG and climate equity ETF products in the fourth quarter. AUM and ETF and non-ETF products linked to MSCI climate equity indexes grew by more than 50% from last year, driven by strong inflows into ETFs and a few key mandate wins from asset owners. Meanwhile, inflows into ETF products linked to MSCI factor indexes were almost $6 billion, with solid inflows into quality, value growth and momentum factors. These MSCI factor index-linked ETF inflows were the highest quarterly flows since the second quarter of 2021. In Analytics, subscription run rate growth was 7%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and was supported by the large wealth and fixed income mandates previously mentioned. Analytics organic revenue growth was approximately 5% in the quarter. As we previously indicated, the revenue growth was impacted by the timing of implementation-related revenues compared to a year ago. The release of subscription revenues related to implementations can be lumpy and will fluctuate from period to period. Near-term, we continue to expect recurring revenue growth rates will be slightly below run rate growth as we compare to periods with higher concentrations of these revenues a year ago. In our ESG and climate reportable segment, subscription run rate growth was 10%, which excludes the impact of FX. Excluding FX headwinds, the subscription run rate growth for the segment was 14% in Europe, 11% in Asia, and 4% in the Americas. Our retention rate for the segment was over 93% with most of the cancels reflecting client down sales and not outright terminations. The multiyear investments we've made in data quality and new content and capabilities like biodiversity, nature, regulatory solutions and geospatial supported recent wins. In general, across our ESG and climate franchise, we are benefiting from the breadth of our offering, data quality, large and comprehensive securities coverage across asset classes and the interoperability across MSCI products and frameworks. In Private Capital Solutions, run rate growth was 15% over the same period last year, and we had a retention rate of 92%. In real assets, new recurring subscription sales improved, although we had some large cancels related to client events and vendor consolidation, particularly among developers, brokers and agents. We had very strong free cash flow in 2024, up 21% with some improvement in collection cycles in Q4, our capital position remained strong with gross leverage of 2.6x 2024 EBITDA, we continue to be laser-focused on continuing to create value through disciplined capital allocation. Turning to our 2025 guidance, which we published earlier this morning. Our expense outlook assumes gradually increasing market levels throughout the year and reflects the ongoing reinvestments we make back into our business to fuel future growth and efficiencies. As we've seen in previous years, we expect adjusted EBITDA expenses to be about $35 million higher sequentially in Q1 2025, compared to Q4 of 2024, mostly driven by elevated compensation and benefits-related expenses. Our CapEx guidance reflects our investments in software development across most parts of the business. Free cash flow guidance reflects higher cash tax payments in Q1, some of which we deferred during 2024. As a reminder, our 2024 free cash flow reflected cash tax timing impacts, of which about $30 million is resulting in elevated payments in 2025. Our interest expense guidance assumes our current debt levels and does not assume additional financings. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to include a benefit from discrete items. Beyond Q1, we expect a quarterly operating effective tax rate of 19% to 21%. We're looking forward to an exciting year ahead. Our financial success and investments from 2024 provide a strong foundation for us to drive further growth in 2025. We have numerous large opportunities that we are poised to capitalize on. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Henry, I wanted to ask a question about how you're thinking about ESG ex-climate, more on the subscription side than on the ABF side. Just how are you thinking about the potential growth rate for the business long-term? Are we in sort of a cyclical challenging period and it accelerates? Or is this sort of the new normal? And what are the key factors that would dictate sort of what happens from here?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Toni. I've spent the last four weeks traveling through various cities in Europe. Visited over 50 clients in four weeks in seven cities and some five countries or so and so I've had a chance to discuss obviously this very critical topic for many of these clients, whether it's managers or wealth managers, banks, insurance companies and the like. And I have not seen any let up in the commitment of all these European financial institutions to sustainability. Obviously, as I prepare to see each one of these clients, I read a lot of their material, the way they position, the way they look at their strategy, the way they describe themselves. And without any – almost any exception, they are positioning themselves to live in a sustainable world. So with respect to Europe, the issue becomes that there is a new set of regulations that people have been adjusting to. They’re rebranding their products and therefore, there’s been a little bit of a pause in launching a lot of new products. But it’d be very hard to believe that European investors, whether retail or institutional investors will move away from their ingrained habits of investing according to sustainability principles. With respect to our product line, the product line needs to evolve from simply ratings and report on ratings to the underlying data, the underlying information, the materiality of the signals that ESG presents for their investment process, et cetera. So therefore, the demand is there. The – obviously, the hiatus and cyclical downturn is still here, but I don’t see any. But we also have to evolve and transform our product line to meet that demand. And part of that demand is compliance with the very heavy disclosures and regulatory requirements of European regulators of a lot of these financial institutions that they’re not only European, but any other international global institution that operate in Europe. So I’m pretty bullish on the opportunity there. We’re beginning to see a lot of this early days, but we’re beginning to see a lot of this in Asia-Pacific with a lot of new regulations in Australia, in Japan, in Hong Kong, in Singapore, et cetera. So that’s important. In the U.S., I think that obviously the new administration is not focused on sustainability, is not focused obviously on climate, and therefore, we have to see how that evolves. But importantly, a lot of our clients in the United States have come to the view that sustainability and climate impact in their portfolio is here to stay and it’s a secular trend, whether person A is President of the United States or person B is President of the United States. So I think that a lot of this will move in the United States from the governmental sector to the private sectors, where it should belong to begin with in people looking at their portfolio and the materiality of these factors in their portfolio. So I think it may take time, but it will come back and the demand will be there. Of course, as we have noted in our disclosures, we have been reevaluating our targets, our long-term targets, and at some point, hopefully throughout at some point during the year, we will be putting that in the marketplace. But we don’t know yet what those be because obviously this has been a little bit of a moving target.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Andy, I just wanted to follow-up on your comment on the exciting year ahead and I was hoping you could just contextualize that a bit with the environment. So this time last year you talked about elevated cancels and then lower budgets following kind of a week market period for your large clients. So from where you stand today, like how do you look at the cancels and what are you hearing on the new budget environment, please?
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. So in general, as we’ve talked about rising markets are supportive for clients, both on the sales and cancels front. The momentum we’ve seen in equity markets and overall confidence in the sustainability of market levels is constructive to buying behaviors in certain areas, notably in the U.S., and so we have seen some encouraging signs. On top of that, my excitement is coming from all the innovations we continue to make. And so we are getting traction in key areas across custom indexes, solutions in front-office analytics, analytics insights, many of our private asset solutions and areas in climate. And so we continue to be very excited about the outlook there. Generally speaking, the environment is somewhat more constructive, and we are seeing a pickup in the pipeline in spots. There are some spots where we still see pressure and it will take some time to fully rebound. We do see some lingering pressures on active managers, particularly in Europe. But overall, we’re seeing a shift in the dynamic. On the point of cancels, as you know from last year, we did have a concentration of cancels related to some big client events. We don’t expect the same level of cancels in the first quarter here as a year ago. As I mentioned, rising markets should be somewhat supportive for clients, and we will still see some lumpiness in lingering noise. But overall, we’re seeing encouraging signs and areas and the market environment is constructive across many areas. And as you know, and as I’ve mentioned before, you shouldn’t focus too much on any one quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just maybe to stay on that same topic, can you maybe talk about how pricing conversations and impact should be this year? Obviously, in the last couple of years, you’ve been a little bit softer there with your competitors. Continue to be pretty aggressive. And as you said, the environment should be better. So maybe you can talk about pricing a little bit more and also maybe on a segment basis because it does seem like in ESG, you have some more opportunities to as this market has matured clearly. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, sure. So Alex, as you alluded to across the company in 2024, the contribution from price increases to sales was slightly less than the contribution in 2023. As you alluded to, we did moderate price increases in certain spots. It is important to keep in mind that price increases are not just like-for-like. We are oftentimes providing clients with broader access, broader usage in addition to continually enhancing our products, which we capture through price increase. And so we are, as you know, very focused on capturing value and linking our price increases to the value that we’re generating the clients. We do look at the overall pricing environment and client health as well as an input here. But the environment, client health, the value we continue to add are important drivers to enable us to capture value from our clients. It’s something that we will continue to monitor closely and calibrate based on the dynamics we’re seeing. But relative to competitors, we think we’re very well-positioned from an offering standpoint. And as you know, we are continually trying to take a long-term approach to pricing with our clients to be strong partners to them over time. From a segment dimension, I don’t want to get into too much color on pricing dynamics specifically. But as you alluded to, and as I mentioned, we think in many areas, we have a very strong value proposition based on the quality of our offering, which is best-in-class based on the breadth of coverage and depth of coverage that we have. The interoperability of our tools and the value of the ecosystem to our clients and our ability to help them raise money drive growth using our tools are all things that position us well to face off against competitors, as you alluded to, in places like ESG, we have seen some competitive wins and we think we're well positioned there. But across the organization, we think we are well positioned relative to competitors as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to drill down further on Andy, your comment on improving pipeline and a constructive environment. I was just wondering if you could also comment on how the sales cycles are trending, if you've seen any shortening there. Those obviously were elongated last year. And on the innovation front, you talked about custom indices. But if you could just drill down further on the trends that you're seeing on the index front. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. So as I alluded to, elevated markets and AUM levels are constructive to get confidence. They're translating through to in many places higher revenue for asset managers and that's constructive to budgets and buying behavior. I'd say the dynamics are very nuanced by geography, by client, by segment, although those things do work through to sales ultimately. And in terms of the sales cycles, there – we see some improvement there, but in many areas it continues to be long. As I alluded to earlier, the dynamics are slightly different between the U.S. and Europe, but overall, we are seeing constructive trends in general and in the U.S. in particular, we are seeing, as you alluded to, momentum across other client segments as well. And so areas like hedge funds, areas like wealth managers, asset owners, these are all areas where we've grown at solid growth rates and delivered solid growth rates in the current quarter. And so the dynamics can be slightly different in those areas. I'd say it's something that continues to evolve and I think we are capitalizing on many of the innovations that we are generating. As I alluded to and you asked about on the custom index side, within that custom index subscription line, the growth in custom indexes was mid-teens. We continue to see very strong progress on the custom index front on the ABF side as well. Obviously, you can see you have visibility into what's going on in ETF flows which were quite strong in the quarter. But if you even look beyond ETF flows into non-ETF passive, we've seen very strong traction in non-market cap weighted products. So these are rough figures. But in non-ETF AUM, we saw close to 35% growth in AUM linked to our non-market cap indexes including ESG and climate and factor indexes. That compares to 20% in the non-ETF category overall and 50% roughly within custom indexes. And so it's an important trend for us in institutional passive, obviously something that's helpful in direct indexing. We also see it on the structured products front with banks and within over the counter derivatives. And so this is an area where harnessing our position with clients, the standards that we have out there, together with our capabilities on the index side and across the organization, we are uniquely positioned be a leader on the custom index front, we're excited for it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Hess with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Alexander Hess: Yes. Hi everybody. Just to go back to the sort of the overall discussion of the trends in the subscription business as it stands, organic subscription run rate growth of 8% in the quarter, a couple quarters of growth of about that level. Obviously MSCI hasn't been an 8% grower in its history. How do we get that cycle to turn? When would that – how are you thinking about when that inflection might occur? Can you help us just dimension how close we are to potential reinflection reacceleration?
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, Alex. As you know, we've gone through a dynamic environment over the last couple years and so there have been a wide range of competing dynamics across client segments, across product areas for us that have all fed into that overall subscription run rate growth. Sitting here, looking forward, we continue to be, as I mentioned, excited about the opportunities in front of us. In the short term here, there's going to continue to be some noise as I alluded to, as we see pressures working through the system. We see some of the lingering impacts of the outflows in asset management over the last couple of years. We see the lingering impacts from some elevated client events that have worked through the system. But you can see in areas like index, we've seen a bit of momentum, obviously, a strong quarter from recurring sales and recurring net new standpoint. And as I alluded to, we are seeing traction in some of those key growth areas, both from a client segment standpoint as well as from a content area standpoint. And so that combined with some of the big secular opportunities, which we think we're well positioned to capitalize on in areas like wealth management were relatively small today, but growing at a healthy growth rate and have a differentiated value proposition there as well as in areas like PCS and the private asset space in general. And then areas like fixed income and on the analytics side, we think we've got attractive opportunities in front of us that will help us fuel higher growth in the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Owen Lau: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Could you please talk a little bit more about your Analytics segment? It looks like the run rate came down a little bit from last quarter. And I think you talked a little bit about the timing of subscription revenue in your prepared remarks. But could you please expand a little bit more on the driver of that? And how do you see the outlook going forward? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. Owen, it's a good question. So let me actually take it in two parts. One, I'll focus on the subscription run rate growth, which if you exclude FX, was relatively consistent from the prior quarter. So I think it was around 7.1% organic subscription run rate growth in the third quarter, 6.7% in the fourth quarter, so both around 7%. The stated number was lower, so it did look like it dropped, but that was driven by a meaningful FX impact on the run rate, which as you know, FX impacts adjust the run rate immediately. So the appreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to areas like the euro and the pound translate through to a drop in the stated run rate. But as we alluded to, the organic run rate has been relatively steady, and we continue to see good momentum in areas like, as we called out fixed income, wealth. Our insights offering continues to open new doors for us and create upsell opportunities. It’s helping to improve the customer experience, bring scale to our clients and help them be more efficient within their large and complex workflows and adding additional value. So we continue to be excited about the momentum we’re seeing in these key growth areas and analytics. As always there can be some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter and so you saw we did see a bit of a pickup in cancels. That’s to be expected as some of the noise that we’ve seen across the company and other segments is hitting analytics. But overall we continue to be encouraged by the momentum we’ve seen in analytics. On the revenue front. As you alluded to, the revenue as we mentioned in prior quarters was impacted by the timing of implementation related revenues. So the revenue was slightly below run rate growth. The revenue growth was slightly below run rate growth in the quarter and this was as a result of lower contribution from implementation related revenue releases, which is in line with what we expected. In the comparable periods a year ago, we did have a large amount of implementation related revenue. So when we compare to those periods the growth rate looks a bit lower. We do expect in the very short-term here that this will continue. So we expect the revenue growth to be slightly below the run rate growth in the next quarter. But I would focus on the run rate growth more generally as a sense does to the direction and trajectory of the segment. And as I mentioned we continue to be excited there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. Your line is open.
Kelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So in private assets this quarter I think we’ve seen declines in both retention rates and net new sales. Was wondering if you can provide a bit more colors on that? I know you touched on that in the prepared remarks. And for private capital solutions, I think at the time of the acquisition you talked about accelerating revenue growth from mid to high teens to 20%. So we’re just wondering what’s the timeline to achieve that target? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Sure. Hi, Kelsey. So yes, maybe I’ll look at PCS separately from real assets because the dynamics are different, as you know. And this is the first quarter when we are reporting the two together here and so it’s worth dissecting them individually. On PCS as you alluded to, we did see a slight slowdown in subscription run rate but pretty steady growth at 15%. The sales and cancels can be a bit volatile and we did see a bit of softness in the recurring net new in the quarter, although we are having good traction in landing new logos to the segment. We’re seeing good traction with both asset owners and managers and asset owners where MSCI is I think bringing some opportunities with large organizations that are MSCI clients and not fully leveraging the Burgiss offering or the PCS offering. And we’ve continued to see good momentum in EMEA and APAC. And so overall we are still encouraged about the opportunity in PCS and we see real opportunities there. Things like the index side, as you know we released in the middle of last year a wide range of benchmarks and indexes for the private asset space. We have been aggressively driving awareness around an adoption of those indexes. And those are things that over time will also lead into additional sales of not only our indexes but our content more broadly. And there’s a whole host of new innovations and content sets that we’re releasing around private credit, around additional data insights, both of which we’re leveraging AI to unlock that are creating robust opportunities for us. But as I said it will be – sales and cancels can be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarter. But overall we continue to be encouraged about the opportunity within PCS. In real assets, we did see the same overall dynamics that we’ve been seeing for the last several quarters. So we were impacted by one large down sale with a client that has been feeling real pressure. We also felt some pressure, as I alluded to in the prepared remarks with brokers and agents that’s translating through to softness in our data and Property Intel products. We are still seeing decent momentum in areas like our Index Intel, which gives market insights. And we have started to see some very early signs of improved traction in capital coming back into the space or seeing institutional money start to come back in in the Americas and Europe. And we hope that that is an early sign of transaction activity coming through at some point in the future and a pickup in activity. But in the fourth quarter we really saw just a continuation of the trends that we’ve seen with probably an outsized contribution of cancels and what we would expect to see just from a couple big items.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Scott Wurtzel: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to ask on the Wealth segment. The growth has been pretty strong there and just wanted to see if you can kind of share what sort of your strategic roadmap and priorities are for that opportunity as we move throughout 2025 to potentially try to maintain that elevated run rate growth? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: Sure. So I think there’s clearly an opportunity across all of our product lines and some of those are in existing use cases across indexes and benchmarking and in other of our standard data used in the investment process. But we think we have much more significant opportunities to help with the scaling of wealth portfolios and the balancing act of central control of risk of portfolio construction with giving advisors insight and actionable tools. And we think there's an enormous opportunity there. And in fact, even just as Henry – Henry and I crossed the Atlantic in opposite directions. So I spent the last few weeks in New York. And a lot of my meetings were with large wealth players. And there is a significant need for improvement in, and I would say, both the analytical environment for the CIO office or the product control groups at the center, and for better tools for advisers. And there's a lot of legacy systems that stand in the place of that. So, I think we have a generalized opportunity across all of our content, including there's enormous amount of discussion and now action of moving more private asset products into the wealth segment. And there's daily news about that, that we all read. And we think we have an enormous opportunity there also to incorporate all of the private asset analytics that we had into the wealth segment, where often the – some of the largest wealth managers are also clearly significant LPs on behalf of their clients as well as some of them even originating enacting as GPs in private markets. So both of those create opportunities for us. So I think the key point that I would say is, we've got very high levels of engagement. I've been in some of those meetings myself. And I think what we'll continue to see, we have attractive growth rates. But I think as we – as some of our solutions start to get traction I hope and believe, and this is our plan, that we get a virtuous circle where our credibility becomes earned as a serious player in the wealth segment, which I think we have all the capabilities to deliver. And I'm quite confident that as we look forward into 2025, that this will be a really, really important year for us in well, and we will see both more significant deals with larger players, and we will establish ourselves with a great deal more credibility as a provider of solutions, data and content to wealth managers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.
Craig Huber: Great, thank you. Can you guys focus on AI here for a few minutes. I'd be curious if you can give us some concrete examples about where you're particularly excited where AI can help you on the cost efficiency side? Maybe also give us some examples of major beneficiaries on the revenue side, enhanced products. And long term, do you think that will help you on the pricing side? I think you will charge more for AI-enhanced products?
Henry Fernandez : Sure. So let me take those in order. So I would say that from the efficiency point of view, very much leading the charge is in our data operations area where we are able to – we've already seen the ability to significantly reduce the cost of data acquisition. But I think also importantly, because we still are growing business with a lot of demand to scale up our ability to get new categories of data with significantly less cost than we would have had in the past. So if you look at certain areas, that is also been tied in, so the product transformation and the efficiency story kind of go hand in hand. So at present [ph], for example,, we've embarked on a scalable sort of mapping of private credit data using AI, which would simply have taken us, first of all, a lot more time. We would have hired – had to hire a lot more humans. So it's both a speed to market is, we're measurably lowering the cost of data acquisition. And extremely importantly, we're going to be able to build more attractive products and analytics on the back of that much more quickly. Clearly in – generally, in software engineering, there are efficiencies to be had with AI. And we've built quite a number of those also into our 2025 budgets. So from a product point of view, I think that we've got some very interesting green shoots and that 2025 will be an important transformative year on the product side. So we've mentioned the AI analytics insights, which we will continue to deepen and it is an important area for us. We will – we currently brought to market for index, some thematic driver discovery using AI, which we've had – which is currently in beta. We've had some very positive feedback from some very major clients and we'll be rolling that out shortly and addition versions of index insights will be coming out later in the year. Again, it's a confluence of data acquisition at scale and product innovation in – notably in the climate area, both in ESG in terms of the scaling of data gathering and the quality control in areas like controversies, et cetera. But one example would be our geospatial data asset intelligence on which we worked with Google and which has a significant AI component. So I think that both in terms of our efficiencies and in terms of new product development, 2025 will be an extremely important year for AI delivery. I think the jury is then still out, whether it creates kind of a raw pricing power. I don’t think it has – that it’s inherently a pricing power topic. I think it’s more an efficiency topic, and it’s a creation of exciting and interesting new products. But I think it’s not entirely clear if it’s a district [ph] sense of pricing power thing. But I think it will be a massive innovation engine, and that should help us drive sales and growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi, thank you. So you’ve alluded to some bifurcation in terms of geography around what you’re seeing from your clients in the U.S. versus outside the U.S. So I’m wondering if you can put a finer point on that, share some color on where you think things might go from here internationally versus the U.S.? And then separately, if I can just sneak in a housekeeping question. You talked about some conversions of onetime data into subscription. So curious if that – I know that’s normal course of business, but curious if that was at an outsized level? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Sure. Sure, Faiza. So on the geographic differences here, listen, as I alluded to earlier, it’s a very nuanced and dynamic picture. So it does vary client segment to client segment, even firm to firm here. But we have seen the pressure on asset managers linger a bit more in Europe. And that is something that I think is we’re seeing both on the sales and cancel side. I think in general, they follow the same trends that the overall asset managers do, there can just be lags there. And so in the Americas, as you know, we’re coming out of a period where we saw significant outflows for several years from many asset managers. I think with the market levels up, sustained momentum, a bit of confidence, we are starting to see that change. And hopefully, we start to see the same thing over time in EMEA, although we expect to see some lingering impacts continuing at least in the near term. And as you know, there are some large mergers, potential mergers out there that could happen as well, which we are keeping our eyes on. But overall we do think the environment is encouraging. I think it’s just going to impact different segments in different regions at different paces here. Sorry, Faiza, on the second question you had, the clarification was on what topic? Well, I think we lost her. I’ll follow up with you, Faiza, on the housekeeping item. Oh, the free float data sales. Yes, apologies for that. So, yes, we do have from time to time, it’s part of our business. Oftentimes, we will sell our free float data package on a onetime basis. And clients when they get a handle on it and how to use it and the value they can derive from it, will convert to a ongoing subscription. And so that is something that we saw in the quarter. I wouldn’t call it out as a significant item in the quarter. It’s something we have seen in prior quarters as well, and it’s part of our business model and part of our trend here. And I think there are a number of data offerings that we have where we can – we get in the door with clients sampling the data and then turn it into an ongoing relationship. So I wouldn’t call out any outsized impact in the quarter from that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to new subscription sales and cancellation trends. You had expected cancellation trends to normalize and improve in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. Can you elaborate on areas that may have surprised the upside or downside in the quarter with respect to cancels and also new sales? And when you expect net new recurring subscription sales to inflect the positive growth?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, sure. I mean I touched on a lot of this earlier and don’t want to be too specific about trajectories or inflection points other than just to highlight that we are seeing encouraging signs, and you do as I alluded to earlier, a pretty strong quarter on the index subscription front, both on the sales and cancel side. Listen, I wouldn’t say there are any dramatic surprises. I think cancels in Q4 came in generally in line with what we had mentioned and what we were expecting. We do see lingering impacts, elevated level of client events and budget constraints. You can see there were elevated cancels in areas like real assets, which we’ve been seeing and expected. You saw – retention rate was pretty solid in ESG and – are pretty consistent in ESG and climate to just above 93%. That stabilized over the prior quarter, but there are certain areas in ESG and climate where we have seen some elevated cancels like with corporates and corporate advisers. And analytics, just by its nature, tends to be lumpy, and we oftentimes do have elevated cancels in the fourth quarter just given client renewals. And so I’d say the dynamics we saw were pretty much in line with what we expected and we continue to be encouraged by the outlook but expect some lingering noise and impacts and probably some elevated degree of cancels from the factors that we’ve seen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.
Russell Quelch: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a question on the partnership with Moody’s in the ESG segment. Wonder what you’re doing with the new data capabilities you talked about on the private side, given you now have access to their Orbis database, is this already something where you’re seeing an impact on sales growth and product opportunities? I also wondered, is there an opportunity to increase the scope of this partnership?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So the announcement that we made, I think last summer had three components to it. The first component was that Moody's analytics, not the Moody's Investor Services, the rating agencies, but Moody's analytics would be subscribing to a lot of our ESG data to be able to package it with their products and sell it to their clients, which are, a lot of them are banks and insurance companies. So that was one part of the announcement, and we have already started doing a lot of that. The second part of the announcement was that we had entered into a contract with Moody's that we will use their Bureau Van Dijk Data, the former Bureau Van Dijk database to create ESG scores on a large number of entities that are sitting in that database. I think it's probably going to be over 100 million entities with ESG scores that can be, again combined with their products and our products. The third part of the announcement was an intention. The first two were actual – the actual deeds, right. The third part of the announcement was an intention to work together on private credit. And, of course, as you know, Moody's is very strong in credit analysis and probabilities of default and the like. And we're very strong, obviously in a lot of databases and a lot of risk analysis and performance analysis of individual instruments and private credit and in funds. So the idea here is to explore the possibility of joining forces with those two complementary capabilities. Obviously, we're still talking, we're still working through things, and if there is some kind of agreement of that, it will be in due course. So those – so I think that it's early days with respect to the synergistic revenues associated with this, both from their side and our side. And obviously, we'll report more as we see an upswing in a lot of this.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Odedra [ph] for Jason Haas. Thanks for squeezing us in here. I just wanted to ask on the expense guidance. For 2024, we saw expenses come in towards the low end of the range despite the run in AUM. I think last call you guys might have signaled that we would be gravitating towards the high end of the range, versus where we ended up coming in. And so I'm just curious as to why that was the case this year. Is there may be some offsetting savings or something to do with what you're seeing in the environment that's keeping you from pressing on the gas a little bit more? And then just wondering if you could talk to us about the puts and takes of the expense guidance range for 2025, understand the assumption on AUM levels gradually increasing throughout the year. Push anything outside of AUM that can take you guys either to the high end or low the guidance range in 2025? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, sure. So just on Q4, there can be a number of items that can swing the ultimate expenses up or down. Things like the ultimate bonus accrual can cause expenses to fluctuate a bit, things like severance levels and other non-comp expenses can cause things to swing a bit. You did pick up on in our messages earlier that we are expecting a jump in expenses in the first quarter. And so there can be some timing-related items. And then, as I alluded to, the main drivers, compensation and benefits-related expenses that is causing the sequential expenses to pick up from Q4 to Q1 here. In terms of the overall guidance for the year, as you heard our guidance is based on the assumption that markets gradually increase throughout the year. The overall approach has not changed where we are really continually trying to maximize the level of investment to drive top line growth, while also driving attractive profitability and cash flow growth on a consistent basis. I'd say embedded in the expense guidance is our plan to continue to invest in those key secular growth areas like rules-based investing, private markets, front office analytics, are a modern architecture, AI-driven enhancements to our infrastructure, but also our solutions. And so we are – we do have an ambitious agenda to continue to invest based on – included in that expense guidance. But we are also continually focused on driving efficiencies. And importantly, we will continually calibrate the pace of spend through the year based on a whole host of factors, as we always do, looking at not only market levels, but business performance, opportunities that we see out there and other factors. So we will keep you posted, but no change in our general approach to expenses.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Motemaden: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question, a follow-up on pricing. So you guys mentioned that pricing was lower in – or the price increase you guys took was lower in 2024 versus 2023, and that you had moderated some of the price increases in 2024. Does that mean that the price you guys captured in 2024 was below sort of the long-term average price increase that you guys have taken historically? And I guess, should we think about that being the same, higher or lower as we think about 2025?
Andy Wiechmann: I would not – yes, I would not – I don't want to provide too much detail on the exact level and relative to historical levels. And just to be clear, the contribution to recurring sales from price increases in 2024 was slightly less than it was in 2023. And as you know, in 2023, it was elevated given the overall pricing environment. Our approach continues to remain the same. I think there are areas where we do have pricing power. Importantly, there are areas where we continue to enhance our products and the value we're delivering to clients and price is a way that we can unlock that, although we are very thoughtful and measured and want to be constructive to our clients. And so those dynamics do differ across the company. But there are opportunities for sure and there are areas where we will be measured.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregory Simpson with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Gregory Simpson: Hi there. Actively managed ETFs were the fastest growing part of the industry last year. I just wanted to ask if the ETF vehicle eventually started to replace the mutual fund. Do you think that changes the opportunity sets for MSCI with active managers? Do you think it's positive, neutral or negative? Thank you.
Baer Pettit: No, it's definitely a positive. So, we're extremely focused on this and been in a number of meetings myself on this topic in the end of last year and the beginning of this year. So, in essence, in simplified form, it is a continuation of active strategies becoming more rules based, so and in turn that plays extremely well to MSCI's strengths both as an index provider and as a provider of portfolio analytics and analysis. So, there are, there's a continuum of this, of things which are much closer to index where we can, we can help asset managers take active strategies and make them more rules based and if you like, indexify them and then there is, or closer to the index end of the spectrum. But there are also a number of ways that we can help manage actually quite active strategies through helping clients build those portfolios, through reflecting them, as the risk management side of them, the portfolio construction side of things. So, this is a huge focus for us right now. You know, going back to the regional thing on both sides of the Atlantic, there may have been somewhat more discussion in the U.S. or maybe I would say more visibility, but it's definitely going to be a global trend and overall, definitely a positive development for us that we're very focused on and where we're developing both more capabilities and new ways of pricing and adding value to our clients.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Alex Hess of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Alex Hess: Yes. Hi, there's a lot of discussion on today's call about product innovation and product rollouts and your products, but maybe on the inorganic side, how do you assess the M&A opportunity now in front of you? Obviously across industries there's a lot of talk about a pickup in M&A. Just wanted to see what you're seeing within your business, specifically.
Henry Fernandez: Thanks for that, Alex. The vast majority of our focus at MSCI is inorganic growth. We have enormous opportunities in new use cases, new client bases, new product development, and importantly in putting together closer and more synergistic many of the data sets, many of the models and maybe many of the analytics that we already have in-house, from climate and ESG data to private assets to connecting them with index to create portfolios that clients create, can create portfolios to look at risk analysis and so on and so forth. So that's been our primary mode. Of course, we look at almost everything that is out there for sale and we analyze it, we investigated it, but we feel that in order for us to deploy capital in those inorganic opportunities, they have to have a high rate of return comparable to some of the returns that we get for organic investments. Of course, there are certain times in which the only way you can get into an area is through an acquisition, like we did with Burgiss and Real Capital Analytics and companies like that, and this on the smaller side, Fabric and Foxberry, et cetera. But our predominant focus is organic growth with that, with opportunistic bolt-ons in the event they come in the strategic areas and they are priced at the right level for us.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Henry Fernandez for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: So, thank you again for joining us today. As you can see, MSCI delivers strong financial results in 2024 and we're very focused on improving our operating metrics, especially in the subscription business, with the backbone of improving client budgets and improving, an improving environment, all of that demonstrates the resilience of our business model and the value that we provide to clients. As Baer indicated and I indicated, client centricity at MSCI starts from the top. So, we spend more than 50% of our time at the top level of our company with talking to clients, understanding their needs, understanding how we can solve them, et cetera. So, we're continuing to expand across key client segments. We're driving innovation. We're working in partnership with clients to create efficiencies and scalability for their business. As we mentioned, we are thoughtful and constructive on price increases. We have enormous pricing power, enormous. But that cannot be misused. It has to be consistent with creating value for our clients because we are a long-term compounder. And as a long-term compounder, we want to be a long-term partner to our clients. So, all of that gives us incredible strength and leadership in the areas of data, models and technology and all of our capabilities. So, we look forward to keeping you abreast of all our activities and development. And we thank you again for the time that you spent with us today.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. I would like to now turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investors Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter 2024. This press release, along with an earnings presentation and brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements, which are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, are based on current expectations and current economic conditions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures. You will find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the equivalent GAAP measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss operating metrics, such as run rate and retention rate. Important information regarding our use of operating metrics, such as run rate and retention rate are available in the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. As a housekeeping item, we wanted to remind our analysts to ask one question at a time during the Q&A portion of our call. We do encourage you to ask more questions by adding yourselves back to the queue. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Good day everyone and thank you for joining us. MSCI's third quarter results highlight the underlying strength of our business model and client footprint, as well as the essential role that our solutions play in global investing. Financially, we achieved total revenue growth of 16%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% and free cash flow growth of 46%. We repurchased $199 million worth of MSCI shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to $440 million. In our operating metrics, we deliver asset based fee revenue growth of nearly 20%, subscription run rate growth of 15% and a retention rate of 94%. Looking at our overall performance, we show significant strength in ABF revenue driven by record AUM balances in both ETF and non ETF products linked to MSCI indices including third quarter ETF cash flows of $18.6 billion. Index and analytics new recurring subscription sales grew 5% and almost 11% respectively. Among asset owners and hedge funds, organic subscription run rate growth was 11% and 15% respectively. Net new recurring sales in our ESG and climate segment were down meaningfully from last year's levels. We think the subdued demand in ESG and climate is cyclical and may be prolonged, but the need for all investors to integrate ESG financial materiality and to decarbonize portfolios are real and secular. On asset managers, new recurring subscription sales were down 5% year-over-year reflecting cyclical pressures, although retention is excellent at 96%. As our Q3 results show, MSCI's product lines are diverse and increasingly complement each other. We are a growth company with enormous addressable market for our products which serve a vital function across the investment ecosystem today. Today, I would also like to comment on three key drivers of our long-term strategy. First, our growth among wealth managers and how it reflects both the increasing use of indices and the benefits of our new technology platform. Second, our progress in developing private capital solutions that cut across product lines and third, our commitment to providing climate solutions that clients need to measure, report and act on decarbonization of investments. Starting with wealth, in Q3 MSCI achieved a major index win with the private banking arm of one of the world's largest banks. We also achieved direct indexing run rate growth of 22%. Meanwhile, our MSCI wealth manager technology platform, formerly known as Fabric, continues driving robust client engagement for analytics. Looking ahead, we believe this platform can help us deliver content for wealth managers that spans multiple product lines including Index, ESG, Climate and Private Assets. In Private Capital Solutions we believe that our work there can enhance our capabilities in many areas. We have already seen this with products such as MSCI Private Capital Fund Indices which are catalyzing important new client wins and prospects since their launch in July. Our private capital fund indices cover more than 13,000 funds that represent more than $11 trillion in AUM and we believe they can help us become a standard setter in private assets. Our partnership with Moody's positions us well to expand our ESG coverage of private companies while also providing more ESG content for segments such as banks, insurance companies and corporates. As we announced last week, I am pleased to welcome Luke Flemmer to MSCI as our new Head of Private Assets to further build and scale our business to new heights. Luke joins us from Goldman Sachs. Regarding Climate Solutions as the risks and negative impacts of climate change become ever more apparent, all institutional investors and capital market participants will need high quality data models and research to adapt. This is inevitable and just a matter of time for this demand to accelerate. MSCI already supplies carbon emission data on more than 60,000 private companies and more than 7,500 private equity and private debt funds. MSCI is well positioned to be the provider of choice for this large scale reallocation of capital and repricing of assets. With that in mind, we're also constantly seeking to upgrade both our talent and our solutions. Last week we announced that Richard Mattison has joined MSCI as Head of ESG and Climate. Richard comes to us from S&P Global and is also the founder and former CEO of Trucost. We know that MSCI will greatly benefit from his expertise and knowledge. Meanwhile, on the Climate Product side, MSCI has responded to the emerging consensus that voluntary carbon markets are critical to achieving net zero. Just last month we introduced MSCI Carbon Project Ratings, which offer comprehensive and independent assessment of more than 4,000 carbon credit projects around the world. All of this demonstrates MSCI's single most important competitive advantage, the global, diversified and integrated nature of our franchise. We have always tried to capture the biggest trends, reshaping the global investment industry. We are now better equipped than ever to capitalize on these trends while supporting both traditional and new client segments. And with that, let me turn the call over to Baer. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you Henry, and greetings everyone. In my remarks today as I review our third quarter results, I'll focus on our progress and opportunities with individual client segments across the investment ecosystem. Let us start with asset owners who are accounted for some of MSCI's most notable Q3 business wins. Overall, we delivered 11% organic subscription run rate growth, with asset owners showing particular strength in analytics. In Asia, for example, a large public pension fund made MSCI their primary risk analytics provider leveraging our highly competitive mix of applications, sophisticated algorithms, specialized data and managed services. We closed another significant deal in analytics with a U.S. public pension fund who selected MSCI as their analytics platform of choice for the entire investment process, from planning and asset allocation through to performance attribution and measurement. In each case, MSCI displaced the major competitor. Deals like these helped us achieve our best third quarter on record for recurring sales in analytics, with particular strength in both Europe and the Americas. Despite the softness that Henry mentioned, asset managers remain the largest contributor to our subscription run rate, adding over $60 million of organic run rate in the past 12 months alone. Our firm wide retention rate among asset managers has stayed high and it was close to 96% in the third quarter. Our asset manager clients still face fee compression leading to tighter budgets, though there are some signs of stabilizing redemption pressures and improving inflows. In MSCI index linked ETFs, year-to-date inflows were nearly $68 billion which helped our ABF revenues grow nearly 20%. As Henry mentioned, our work in index increasingly reinforces our work in Climate and MSCI is leveraging this integration to help asset managers navigate the low carbon transition. In the third quarter, one of our pension fund clients in Europe ceded a $1.6 billion ETF linked to an MSCI climate Custom Index launched by one of our asset manager clients. Turning to other client segments, MSCI also did well with hedge funds, wealth managers and banks and broker dealers who have collectively added $60 million in organic subscription run rate over the past 12 months and grew by 10% combined in Q3. For example, we completed a large ticket deal with a global quantitative investment firm who will use our index content and analytics risk data to enhance their overall research and alpha generation strategy. Shifting to wealth managers, they have added about $11 million to MSCI's organic subscription run rate over the past 12 months. Our wealth subscription run rate now stands at $112 million, growing 11% organically and we have a wealth retention rate of over 97%. MSCI's wealth solutions have become a key differentiator with clients seeking firm wide investment tools that support the home office while enabling optimization and alignment across leverage, risk, rebalancing, taxes and securities and fund selection. We are well positioned to build on this momentum leveraging the MSCI wealth manager platform in different business areas. Wealth represents a key opportunity for MSCI and we will continue growing our wealth focused investments across product, client coverage and research. As you can see, MSCI remains determined to increase our wallet share with both established and newer client segments throughout the investment ecosystem. All of this has enabled our consistent delivery of attractive top line growth and profitability. And with that, let me turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks Baer and hi everyone. In the third quarter we delivered 11% organic revenue growth, 17% adjusted EBITDA growth and 46% free cash flow growth. Within our index segment subscription run rate growth with asset managers and asset owners was 7% and 11% respectively. These large established client segments represent nearly 70% of our index subscription run rate. Index subscription run rate growth with hedge funds and wealth managers was 23% and 13% respectively in the third quarter. Global cash inflows into equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes was $18.6 billion in the quarter. We saw robust cash inflows into non U S exposures, particularly in developed markets outside the U.S. These flows together with strong market appreciation helped to power another quarter of record balances with the ending AUM and Equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes of $1.76 trillion. Additionally, AUM and non-ETF passive products linked to MSCI indexes reached $3.65 trillion, also a record balance. The combined record AUM balances of $5.4 trillion across ETFs and non ETF index products linked to MSCI indexes drove nearly 20% year-over-year growth in ETF revenue and reflect momentum in the long-term trend of indexed investing. In analytics, subscription run rate growth was 8% reflecting the traction we see across several key growth areas such as our factor models, our Insights offering and our fixed income analytics offerings. Organic revenue growth was slightly below 12% in the quarter, benefiting from another quarter of strong non-recurring revenue and some large implementations coming online faster than anticipated. We still expect recurring revenue growth rates to more closely align with run rate growth in the upcoming quarters, especially as we begin to compare to prior year periods that included large implementation related revenues. As a reminder, the timing of implementations is lumpy and revenue growth will fluctuate for several reasons as it has in the past. In our ESG and climate reportable segment, organic run rate growth was 11% which excludes the impact of FX and about $5.3 million of run rate from Trove. Regionally, the subscription run rate growth for the segment was 22% in Europe, 18% in Asia and 7% in the Americas. Client engagement remains strong and we continue to see clients looking to grow with us on a number of fronts. We have seen successes from clients looking to consolidate providers, solidifying our position as a leader. We remain competitively differentiated and we continue to believe our ESG and climate solutions are a mission critical part of the investment process, representing a massive opportunity across ESG integration, regulatory compliance and climate. We also recognize that the recovery of this product line to higher growth rates may take some time and therefore we continue to evaluate the through the cycle growth trajectory of this product and what the ultimate long-term growth target should be. In Private Capital Solutions run rate growth was 17% over the same period last year with new recurring subscription sales of over $6 million. Since the end of 2023, over 1/4 of our incremental Private Capital Solutions run rate growth has originated from new client relationships. The Private Capital Solutions retention rate was almost 94% and we recorded almost $27 million of revenue for the quarter. In real assets, run rate growth was roughly 5% in the third quarter with a retention rate slightly above 92%, improving both sequentially and versus the same period last year. During the quarter we closed a few large ticket deals in the Americas. One of these large deals was for our transaction data offering and was enabled by our open integration which allows clients to access our large content sets on platforms like Snowflake. We see very early signs of improving market activity. Although the commercial real estate industry continues to see significant pressure. Across the company, we saw the resilience of our financial model and our ability to generate strong free cash flows. In the third quarter we repurchased over $199 million of MSCI shares at an average price of roughly $522. This brings our year-to-date repurchases to $440 million or 879,000 shares at an average price of about $501. Our cash balance at quarter end was over $500 million and we continue to be focused on opportunistically repurchasing our shares. I would highlight that we paid down $125 million of our revolver subsequent to quarter end. Moving forward, we may pay down and draw the revolver in modest amounts from time to time to support our capital uses and optimize interest expense. Turning to our 2024 guidance, consistent with our previous comments, if markets remain at current levels or higher, we expect to be towards the higher end of our expense guidance range for full year 2024. We've increased our CapEx guidance range by $10 million, reflecting our plan to purchase a larger amount of hardware for our data center in the fourth quarter. We are enhancing our data center environment to more effectively and efficiently support the growth of several of our new solutions in a hybrid cloud and data center approach to infra infrastructure. We have increased our free cash flow guidance range by $80 million, which reflects some strengthening of cash collections and some tax timing benefits. This year we are seeing a $40 million discrete tax timing benefit and a roughly $30 million deferral on certain cash tax payments. It's worth noting that the $30 million cash tax deferral will be paid in early 2025. The lower interest expense guidance primarily reflects the previously mentioned revolver paydown. We also narrowed the forecasted range for the effective tax rate to 18% to 19.5%, based on refined estimates of discrete items we expect to be finalized in Q4. In summary, we remain encouraged by the dialogue with clients and we see very attractive long-term opportunities. While we are beginning to see some gradual signs of improvement in the sales pipeline, we still expect some degree of elevated cancel activity and longer sales cycles to continue in the near term. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. And with that operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first line comes or your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning Henry, I just wanted to ask about the recent management changes you made in both ESG and private credit. Those are obviously two areas that you've talked a lot about having a lot of long-term massive opportunities. So just trying to understand if that's signaling any change or strategy or any nuances that you might want to point out to us.
Henry Fernandez: No, thank you for that question Manav. The -- this is just a continuation of strengthening and deepening our senior management team, especially in areas that we see incredible run -- runway into the future. As we have said before, the global investment process and the global investment community is increasingly focused on the investment in private assets. Obviously private credit is in a revolution right now and will transform finance in many parts of the world with a continual strength in private equities and private infrastructure is obviously developing into a major asset class. And even though a private real estate is a little part of private real estate are in some difficulties overall, the world will need a lot more physical assets in that space. So with that, we were fortunate to attract Luke to come to us from Goldman Sachs Asset Management to help us lead this effort. We have traditionally been very strong in LPs and are looking to develop new products to be very strong also with GPs. ESG and Climate, you can obviously divide it into two. ESG is still going through its own issues around the world, although we've stabilized and think that we'll do well and on a long-term basis, ESG investing is here to stay and we're really focused on developing the Climate part which given the distractions in the global economy and global politics in the last couple of years we have seen an incredible increase in physical risks. The hurricanes in Florida, the floods in Europe, the droughts in Brazil, the fireplaces in Brazil. So there's no doubt that the world is changing as it relates to climate and the capital industries of the world, investment, finance, insurance will require massive amounts of data, especially carbon emission estimates, a lot of models, valuation models, risk models and the like. And we're very fortunate to have Richard joining us, effective today, actually to do that. And he comes from being founder and CEO of Trucost, a major company in climate. And we're very fortunate that he can help us lead that effort and develop new capabilities and new tools and new client segments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Hey thanks so much. Now that we're getting closer to the end of the year, I was hoping you could share any early read on the budget environment at your clients and maybe in particular how you're thinking about pricing in 2025. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Hi Tony, it's Andy here. I would say across MSCI and across our client base, speaking generally, we are beginning to see some gradual signs of improvement in dialogues which we hope will translate through to some building of sales pipeline over time. I would highlight that we do expect elevated cancel activity and longer sales cycles to continue in the near term here. As you know, asset managers are our largest client segment by run rate. And while redemptions and outflows, as Baer mentioned, are stabilizing, asset managers are still managing with tighter budgets. So we do see that pressure in our dialogue day to day. Although given the run in AUMs, we are seeing more constructive dialogues and thinking around clients which we hope translates through to improve budgets. On the pricing front, listen, the message is consistent with what we've said in recent quarters here where we have been moderating our price increases. And the contribution from price to overall recurring sales is down slightly from a year ago. I would say we are very focused on not only the overall price environment and client health, but the value that we're delivering and we even where we can increase price more and there probably are those opportunities. We are really taking a long-term view and a long-term approach here and we want to be constructive partners to our clients. I think there are places where some of our competitors are being more aggressive on price and I think this positions us well to build a relationship for the long-term here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes, hey, good morning everyone. Just wanted to stay on the same topic and sorry if I'm being too nitpicky about the super short term here. But I think Andy, previously you had suggested that things should get better in the 4Q in particular on retention. So if I'm hearing you correctly, it sounds like things are still pretty soft. So maybe you can be a little bit more specific how you think cancellations should be on a year-over-year base in the 4Q, which is obviously the most important quarter. And then maybe same comment on the sales. And if you want to be specific on the segments, given that you should have some line in sight by now, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, sure. Alex and I don't want to be too specific. Obviously things can move quarter to quarter here and as you've seen, we can have some lumpy quarter to quarter. But on the cancel side, we are expecting Q4 cancels to continue to be elevated relative to the fourth quarter of last year. And as you alluded to, Q4 typically tends to be a period of higher cancels for us seasonally. I'd say we are continuing to work through the impacts of the elevated level of client events that we've seen over the last year and the impacts of many of the pressures that we've discussed on industry participants. I would say consistent with our past comments, we do expect retention rates to be closer to the levels in the fourth quarter of last year relative to the size of the drop we saw in retention rates in Q3 compared to a year ago. On the sales side, as I alluded to, we continue to see tighter budgets. It really does vary across client segments. We are seeing earlier signs of constructive dialogue. I think as I alluded to in the prior question, with the run in AUMs, many of our clients are seeing their revenue improve and so we have seen some encouraging signs. But these things take time to work through the system and work into resetting a budget with our clients. And so we are cautious here, but hopefully see some early momentum.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Hess with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Alexander Hess: Yes. Hi, gentlemen. So we've had quite a few quarters now with discussion around sort of the sales cycle in the asset manager channel specifically. But how do you guys in a value one, look internally and make sure that it's not, say, a product gap within MSCI or an execution gap within MSCI? And then two, as we as analysts look externally, what would you say are the biggest metrics or external to MSCI, factors that the community can track and assess when that pivot might happen on client budgets?
Baer Pettit: Yes, thanks for the question, Alex Baer here. So, look, clearly when we are making that sort of assessment, as you alluded to, the competitive situation is a critical one and we don't have enough time here to go product by product or sub product. But certainly where we tend to view it as a more of a industry thing, it's either where we may not be doing that great ourselves, but the competition is doing significantly worse. And there are some cases of that. You may have seen that in some of the announcements of earnings that have come out from some of our competitors. So that's an important indicator. We're also clearly looking at the amount of cancels that may arise from client events as opposed to. So it may be a consolidation of the kind that we've seen during the course of this year. So that's an important distinction in the category of are we doing something right or wrong, etcetera. And I think generally we have a pretty good track record of a high level of transparency on this call in terms of both indications relating to the product pipeline, the competition, and in terms of the external numbers. We give a pretty high level of granularity in terms of both at the SEC segment level, but even below that in some of the combined categories that we have created to analyze the market. So I think that when we look at the sum of all of those things, I think it does help us to differentiate precisely what might be a more challenging competitive situation from one which is more driven by the economics of the industry and what's happening more broadly within a given client segment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to drill down further on ASG and Climate. There was a reference to a cyclical but prolonged subdued demand there, but strong secular trends. Where do we start to see some of those cyclical headwinds, moderate? What are the things that we should continue to track? And with this leadership change and a greater focus on climate, does that also help with the sales momentum and ability to bundle climate with ESG? So any color on that front. Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: So look, I think it's important to differentiate the secular and the cyclical here. On a secular basis if you analyze the world, the economic and social world we live in today, it's extremely hard to believe that societies around the world are not going to be focused on social issues, environmental issues and governance issues of the entities that are accountable to society. It's just extremely hard to believe that in a highly interconnected, highly interrelated world that, and we're seeing a lot of that in terms of tensions, social tensions between the core population and the immigrant population of countries. We see tensions in the governance of companies and a week doesn't go by without some issues in a company or a not for profit or a university. And of course it's very hard to believe that the climate change is not going to affect the strategies and the winnings or losing of companies and societies and countries around the world. Right now the world is extremely short term focused on monetary policy and inflation and the war in Europe and potential war in the Middle East and is taking his eyes off many of these issues. We believe very strongly at MSCI, that focus will come back. We’ll come back if you look at all the underlying trends that I was mentioning. We are in a cyclical drought, in a cyclical downturn here, given the reset of regulation in Europe, given some of the political events in the U.S. But we are a company that focuses on the long-term and invest for the long-term. And I think that climate is gradually going to recover, probably sooner rather than later. We've given all the physical events that have taken place in the world. And ESG will may take a little more time, but it will recover and it will return to higher growth rates. So therefore, we are not abandoning that philosophy because we are -- MSCI is totally predicated on long-term trends that are going on in the global investment industry. So all the people may disagree with our assessment, but we have been pretty good and having a good track record of pointing out to long-term trends and how these trends will come back. And we don't manage the company on a quarter-to-quarter basis or a year-to-year basis. We are a long-term compounder of earnings growth and revenue growth, and we believe that these two areas of ESG and climate will provide a meaningful uplift in our revenues over time. That is -- it's all predicated on an analysis of global economics, global social issues, global environmental issues and all of that. And I think that as the world begins to received from the focus on inflation and monetary policy and soft landing or hard landing or the war in Europe, the focus will come back to a lot of the social issues in our multicultural societies, and what companies are doing to attract the best talent in an environment like that and what companies are doing to navigate the low carbon transition. So all of that, it will come back. And we're beginning to see some of that already in climate. Maybe it takes a little longer in ESG, but we're going to see that happening.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Wurtzel: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the fixed income and multi asset side of the business. I mean, I think when you look at the emerging growth opportunities, it was one of the stronger growers on an organic basis. So I was really just wondering if you can kind of share with us maybe where we are in your journey on the fixed income multi asset class analytics side and how much more room there is for that side of the business to continue to sort of grow at these elevated rates. Thank you.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So thanks for the question. As you heard in the prepared remarks, I think it was Andy mentioned that fixed income has been an important, very important component of our strength and credibility generally across analytics. So there are quite a number of sales where in very simple terms I don't think we would have had the same success, let's say three, five years ago with the capabilities that we had then. So it's both an important component of the multi asset class sales and we're looking for increasing ways of delivering those fixed income capabilities directly on a standalone basis, the front office and seeing some success with that. So as we go forward into next year, if we can continue to enhance important areas like fixed income performance attribution, which are critical to both sales and retention in analytics, which I think we have very much the intention and capability of doing, then we will believe that this will continue to be a really solid part of our growth story. It's not a fast, sexy thing that that moves quickly, but I think we're developing a reputation for delivering high quality, clearly mostly in fixed income analytics, but also increasingly in fixed income index. So I think in both of those areas we can expect the trend to continue for sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Kelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, on private assets, I think with the new leadership in place, just kind of want to circle back to your medium term strategy to expand in that market. So previously I think during the Burgiss acquisition call, you talked about three buckets of private asset benchmarking data providers and MSCI has planned to expand into front end of compiling transaction benchmarking data. So just kind of curious to hear your latest thoughts on that topic as well as the kind of investment that you plan to devote to that area, the timeline of this expansion.
Baer Pettit: Hi, great question. Thank you. So look, first of all, what I'm most excited about is we intend to continue to collect much deeper and broader data in private markets which will enrich our analytical capabilities quite extensively and the things that we're doing there also with AI to scale up the breadth and depth of the data we collect is very exciting. I have some really exciting demos even in the last week and I think in the coming year we will see significant expansion of that. That means both we can continue to serve the LP client base where I think we have significant demand. We're growing in the high teens now, but we would hope to do better there. I'm not changing the guidance, but we're, we've got a lot of opportunities but equally by taking all of that new data that we're bringing in, we can do more in specific sub asset class analytics, for example, in private credit or other categories of private equity, etcetera. And then in turn we believe that this could help us create a bridge between the LPs and the GPs and serve greater GP use cases. You also alluded to benchmarking and indexes in private markets. So it's relatively early days since, we have taken over those benchmarks and we're redoing them. I think with our expertise there, there are quite a number of enhancements related to specific use cases that we're in the process of improving. So I think that again in the coming year our role in benchmarking and measurement in private markets will extend beyond real estate into the other asset classes. So I think overall I'm very excited about the opportunity we have there. And bringing Luke on board I think will also help to drive that strategy even further.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tung with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to revisit net new recurring subscription trends. So net new recurring subscription sales flipped from positive growth in 2Q to a decline in 3Q. You talked about tighter client budgets, cancel rates in the quarter, which was also the case in 2Q. Can you talk a bit more about what happened in this quarter to drive this flip and what external conditions you would need to see for trends to improve?
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Hey George, Andy. So I would highlight that the sales remain pretty strong. We saw particularly in areas like Index and Analytics, our two large franchises, pretty good sales. We've just seen an uptick in cancels in the third quarter compared to a year ago. Cancels, as you know, can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and we've seen that this year. We do expect some of that lumpiness to continue in the near term. But overall, as I alluded to, we are seeing early signs of improvement in the space. Some of the cancels that we've been seeing are a reflection of the client events that we've seen over the last year. So we're still working through those. And so the combination of improvements in client dialogue translating through to enhanced sales pipeline with us continuing to just work through these lingering cancels we believe should translate through to more encouraging recurring net new for us moving forward here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about competitive displacement. I think there in your commentary I think you were referring specifically to the analytics business and you mentioned several deals where you displaced a competitor. Curious if you can give us more color around the sustainability of that and are there any, is there a specific product that's leading to these displacements? Just any additional color there would be helpful.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So look, I think that if you look at ESG and Climate, I think there's a lot of data showing that we're displacing competitors notwithstanding some of the headwinds. And we had for example, still 22% run rate growth in EMEA. So I think that there's plenty of evidence there. I think that our position in Index is very strong. In Analytics and as you know, we have a long standing policy that we don't go into any competitors by name here. But these are often quite formal situations where there may be an RFP or there is a significant decision by the client. So it's pretty clear what the competitive framework is and generally a bit less so in private markets where again depending on what part of the woods you're in, the competitive situation is more fluid. So I would say that, overall we are confident that we are executing well in a competitive framework. Now clearly, there's always new functionality, there's always new capabilities being brought into market by both ourselves and our competitors. But allowing for the information available to us, I think we feel solid about what we're doing vis-a-vis the competition.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. Please go ahead.
David Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Andy and Baer. You guys both spoke about seeing early signs of constructive dialogues with clients. Just given the run in AUM, which is helping the revenue at your clients improve and also some stabilization and flows. I'm just wondering, from your perspective, what else do you think you need to see before we reach an inflection point on the new sales? And is there anything that makes you think the historic relationship between AUM and client activity will not hold in the future?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, and it's important to underscore that we do see varying dynamics across the business. We are a diversified franchise that has many different aspects to growth here, and so it's more complex than we are making it. But listen, we know our largest client segment is active asset managers. We know they've worked through a couple tough years here where they've seen very strong outflows. We have seen those outflows stabilize, as you alluded to, and we've seen the AUM increase year-over-year. These are organizations that are looking to grow and they want to grow with us, and the tools that we provide them are tools that can help them grow. And so that is encouraging for us. And as you alluded to and as we've mentioned here, those are things that should translate through to additional demand. The clients aren't yet, I'd say, in expansionary mode, but they are in early days of constructive mode and hopefully that translates through to the more constructive budget setting for 2025 for us. I do also want to highlight that we see strong momentum in other client segments. So we're seeing outsized growth in many of those big markets where we are of smaller size today. So we're seeing strong momentum in wealth. We see big opportunities there. We've seen strong momentum in areas like insurance companies, asset owners, as they increasingly internalize and become as much managers themselves. We are seeing big opportunities to grow with them. And that comes through both on the subscription side as well as on the ABF side. And so we have a number of avenues of growth across the franchise that should continue to drive elevated growth on top of what we hope is some rebound on the active asset managers here over the coming quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kwun Sum Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Owen Lau: Yes, it's Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Thank you for taking my question. So on Analytics, I want to better understand the message here. Many of the peers talk about tight budget and vendor consolidation. And I think you also talk about it. But both of your recurring subscriptions and non-recurring revenue were pretty strong in the third quarter. So was it driven by implementation revenue or episodic large deal? And then if you can talk about the outlook of analytics, that would be great. And then just quickly on run rate, when I do the math by adding your beginning analytics subscription run rate to the net new sales, I got $685 million. But your reported number was 691. It would be great if you can explain the delta here. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, sure. Yes. And there's a few dynamics in there that I'll call out separately. So just on your last question about the beginning run rate plus net new being different than the ending run rate, there are some technical items that can cause it to be different, one of which most notably is FX. So FX movements impact the overall run rate base and so can cause that run rate to move by differing amounts than the net new addition. In terms of the growth in analytics, I'll talk first about the overall business momentum and what that means for the run rate growth, but then I will touch on the revenue growth which has been elevated for the last several quarters here and I'll talk about what's been driving that. But listen, across analytics, as Baer alluded to earlier, we've really had strong success on a number of fronts. I think much of that is driven by an environment that is more dynamic where there's heightened risk. And so we've seen strong demand for our equity risk models as clients are looking to understand what is driving their portfolios and have a better understanding of the bets that they are taking. We see our equity risk models being integrated into many different parts of the active management industry. And we've had tremendous success with hedge funds, but even with active managers. We also have seen some wins on the back of the improvements we've made in the fixed income offering, and that also includes things like liquidity analytics which are areas that tend to get more attention and higher risk environments and environments that are a bit more volatile. And then we've also been an enabler for our clients to be more efficient. So things like our insights offering or risk insights offering or something that not only allow our clients to glean more insights from our risk services that we provide, but it makes it more efficient for them to work with us. And so it can be a win-win for them where they're not only improving their analytics, but they are also operating more efficiently. And so all those things in these environments are helpful and have been encouraging. Now on the revenue side, we did have a large implementation come online in Q3, which was earlier than we expected. And as a result, we had a sizable revenue catch up. We have seen a number of large implementations coming online over the last several quarters, which have caused the revenue growth to be higher than a run rate growth. As we've said before, we expect revenue growth to drop to be closer to run rate growth or even in periods -- some periods below that as we begin to compare to the periods where we've had these large implementation catch-up revenues over this past year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Craig Huber: Yes, hi there. Maybe just talk a little bit further about the environment here. I know you went on and talked about this a lot though, but given how well the stock market has done here, not only this year but last year, given what the Fed is finally lowering rates here, inflation seems like it's much more under control. People, as we all know a year, year and a half ago, two years ago, are very worried about the recession in the U.S. at least that has not happened. Most managers you talk to feel better about the U.S. economy and stuff, but definitely with better AUM numbers out there and stuff. Why do you guys keep talking about and thinking and sensing and hearing from your clients about a tough operating environment here? Are you it is still just too early to talk about 2025 and having those discussions. I would think that those discussions in November, December, January that set the budgets for next year are probably going to be a lot more positive than they were a year ago. My question is what am I missing here? Why are things so negative out there? What you're hearing from clients with a little bit of green shoots but nothing great, you're saying? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: It's a very insightful question and it cuts across the core of what we've been talking about here is. So basically, when you look at the totality of MSCI we have a number of very strong areas of performance. You have the asset-based fee business coming out of passive, which is hitting records of AUM and ETF and non-ETF linked products linked to MSCI. You have significant sales into asset owners, into hedge funds wealth managers, incipient sales into the insurance client segment. And on the product side, clearly significant sales of analytics, a very strong sales of analytics and into many of those segments, etcetera. I think that in this call and overall, maybe there is an overemphasis on the weaker areas, or the softer areas of the company. And the first one, for sure, is 50-plus percent of our subscription run rate is to active asset managers who are a segment that is not fully recovered yet from -- they definitely have had a price increase, so to speak, with the global equity markets and in records. And the fund flows are getting better, significantly better in the last few quarters. So we should see a major recovery of the asset -- of the active asset management segment going into 2025, given that rightly pointed out, their budgets are going to be better, given the return of growth in revenues and in profitability. But that doesn't happened yet. And we always call a spade a spade. So that hasn't happened yet and it may or may not happen in the fourth quarter. But we're cautiously optimistic that if logic indicates and precedent indicates that, that will begin to happen in 2025. So that's one area of softness. The second area of softness is clearly the ESG and Climate sales, which as I alluded to earlier, are in a cyclical -- have been in a cyclical downturn. We feel that we're reaching -- we have reached bottom in ESG. We're recovering in climate, but it's hard to predict on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There are major consolidation plays that we have achieved in ESG away from competitors. That is likely to continue. We have significant sales on ESG into non-asset management client segments like corporates, for example, and GPs and the like. And climate, it has slowed down, but it's temporary. We believe that given the physical and transition risks that are going on in the world and potentially with a focus of the climate COP by the UN in Brazil next year, there's going to be a renewed effort in all of that. So I think that -- I don't think you'll get -- I think you're absolutely right. I mean I think you are -- there's no mystery to what is happening here. We have a major reliance on the active asset management segment that has gone through some of these issues for the last year or two. We should expect that to get better. We should expect climate sales maybe to get better. ESG, it will depend on what happens in 2025. But the rest of the company, we're setting records in ABF. We're setting records in sales and Index. We're setting records in sales and Analytics. So there's a little bit of too much emphasis on the glass of empty obviously, in this call. And I understand why. And we're always true to pointing out what works and what doesn't and sometimes we point out a little more to what is not working to what is working. But you got to look at the balanced approach that we're having here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jason Haas: Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious if you could talk about why you didn't decide to raise the expense guidance range for the year, recognizing you're saying that higher AUM levels could be sort of to the higher end of the range. But just given how the market is performing this year. Why not take that out -- are you seeing offsetting savings? Or is it the environment that keeps you more cautious to invest more? Any color would be helpful. Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. So listen, we're always looking for opportunities to invest more in key growth areas in the business. And as you alluded to, that AUM levels are higher than those that we had assumed underlying our guidance at the beginning of the year. And so as we mentioned, if they stay at this level or higher, we are likely to be towards the higher end of our expense guidance range, which is a reflection of a pickup in our level of investment, and we are using it as an opportunity to continue to drive growth in those compelling secular opportunities like rules-based index portfolios, private markets enhancing our position with the front office and analytics, investing in our architecture and interfaces, including the AI capabilities that not only drive internal efficiencies, but are powering growth. And so those are all things that we are focused on and doing and will continue to do. But we are continually balancing, driving stable and continued profitability growth with investing for the long-term, and it's a constant calibration. The other thing I would highlight is there can be some lag as well. And so when there are some investments that come through quickly, but there are some that take some time to work through. And so -- it's just a nuanced dynamic on our cost base, and there are several factors at play that can cause expenses to swing quarter-to-quarter here. So I wouldn't read too much into one quarter in our expense guidance for the year. As I said, it's a constant calibration and we are continually looking for opportunities to invest in the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Pleased go ahead.
Russell Quelch: Hey good morning. Thanks for having me on. You reported another strong quarter of mid-teens run rate, revenue growth in the custom and specialized index solutions. I think that now accounts for close to 10% of index segment run rate revenue. I'm wondering how big you see the opportunity here to be, and what's differentiated about MSCI's proposition versus competitors that are also talking about growth here? And the kind of second part of that question, can you sort of explain to what extent if any growth in this business sort of cannibalizes opportunities in other parts of the index business and how it affects the overall segment index margin?
Baer Pettit: Hi, Russell thanks for the question. Yes. So look, we remain very excited about this. And I would say that it's not merely a capability question, which is important, but it also plays itself out across very different use cases in different client segments. So we're integrating the Foxberry acquisition into our custom index capabilities, and that will be coming online in roughly the next few quarters. That should give us significantly greater speed and flexibility in terms of what we can do, whether that's by different types of calculations or combinations of different asset classes, eventually, etcetera. So then in turn, I think where we have some competitive advantage is precisely because of both the models, the capabilities, the research that we have from analytics for portfolio construction and risk factor exposures, all of the enormous topic of climate and indexes adjusted on that basis, which we had in some of our prepared remarks today, the opportunities that those are creating. There are -- there's quite literally not a client segment that we work with that doesn't need more of these capabilities, whether they be asset owners, either at the mandate or the plan, the entire plan level and clearly even specific use cases, depending on the type of asset owner the asset management industry, both for products and benchmarks, the sell side for structured products, which is a huge opportunity for us that we can do a lot more in. In wealth the capabilities of both doing mass customization with index, linking that to ETFs, building that into the wealth manager platform, for wealth management firms to control the risk at scale while customizing portfolios. So all of this is really, really critical and exciting part of our growth story. And as I said, we're at an inflection point where we're just bringing on new capabilities in this area which in the next few quarters and going into next year will become much more significant and will increase our speed to market and will allow us to do a lot more all of this. So delighted to take the question, and this will remain a very large opportunity for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Simpson with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Gregory Simpson: Hi, guys. I just wanted to check in on how the RCA business is performing within the context of the 2% private assets organic run rate growth this quarter. I think when you originally acquired it, you talked about a double-digit growth aspirations. So what do you see as key to accelerate this back up? Is it mainly a cyclical issue around real estate transaction activity? Or is there anything you'd call out on the competitive side you're seeing? Thank you.
Baer Pettit: Yes. Thanks for the question. So look, I think the simple and major challenge we've been seeing in this is transaction volume. It's a pretty straightforward answer. So there's been -- there was clearly a significant drop in transaction volume, which is a major part of the revenue drivers here. Now we're starting to see that pick up and there are -- there's definitely evidence of -- we have various research measurements of the spread between basically buyers and sellers in the real estate market that has compressed significantly. We're starting to see the beginning of more transactions. We believe we're likely to see that more in the coming year. Maybe in keeping with the overall tone of this call, where I think we're trying to be sober and maybe a little bit more the under-promise and over-deliver department we didn't put that in our prepared remarks. But I think we have good grounds to believe that we could be turning the corner in that area in the coming year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes hey again. Just one very quick one on the custom opportunity that you just discussed. Maybe I'm being again to nitpicky on the numbers or glass of empty, but if I look at the run rate that they disclosed for customer and specialized, I think it actually went down a couple of hundred thousand dollars quarter-over-quarter. Again, it's a small number, it's a small quarter, but just wondering if there were some elevated cancels to call out or why that didn't grow quarter-over-quarter? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, nothing to call out right now. If anything, I would just say some of the broader pressures impacting the business are also impacting custom and special packages that are impacting all of our modules. But everything Baer said, holds true. This is a massive opportunity for us, and we see strong engagement across many different client bases and use cases. The other thing to underscore here is climate custom index is a key growth driver for us in ABF as well. And so clearly, it's something that's helping on the subscription side, but it's something that's helping to fuel many different avenues within the asset-based fee line as well. And we see that across institutional passive mandates. We see it in the wealth channel with direct indexing and we see it even with ETF providers. So it's one that is excited for us on a number of levels.
Operator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Henry Fernandez for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Well, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us today and your continued interest in MSCI. As you can see from the -- all the publications we have did today and the prepared remarks and the Q&A, we're intensely focused on delivering innovative products and capabilities to support our clients and grow our wallet share with them. Our steadfast execution is what enables us to deliver on a very ambitious strategy and to be a long-term compounder of shareholder value creation. Obviously, we always try to moderate our enthusiasm, moderate our optimism and our positivism because we like to show delivery of actual results rather than talk about potential results. And you saw some of that in this call. So please be mindful of that. We look forward to engaging with all of you during the quarter and update you on all the exciting things we're doing.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. I would like to now turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investors Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter 2024. This press release, along with an earnings presentation and brief quarterly update are available on our Web site, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements, which are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, are based on current expectations and current economic conditions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures. You will find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the equivalent GAAP measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss operating metrics, such as run rate and retention rate. Important information regarding our use of operating metrics, such as run rate and retention rate are available in the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. As a housekeeping item, we wanted to remind our analysts to ask one question at a time during the Q&A portion of our call. We do encourage you to ask more questions by adding yourselves back to the queue. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, MSCI achieved strong results, thanks to our all-weather franchise, our blue-chip client base, our wide range of mission critical solutions and our intense focus on execution. We delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 12%, organic revenue growth of 10% with asset based fee revenue growth of 18%, driven by record AUM balances in both ETFs and nonlisted products linked to MSCI indices, free cash flow growth of 21%. In our operating metrics, we delivered subscription run rate growth of 14%, including organic growth of 9%, our highest second quarter on record for new recurring subscription sales of $83 million, up 22% year-over-year and a retention rate of almost 95% across MSCI. Through yesterday, we repurchased $290 million worth of MSCI shares at an average price of $484 per share. We have now bought back more than 50 million MSCI shares since 2012 at an average price of $122 per share for a total consideration of roughly $6.1 billion. Our combined repurchases represent almost 40% of the total outstanding shares of MSCI. These actions are consistent with our own change and relentless focus on capital allocation. Year in and year out, we are obsessively focused on creating value for our shareholders. Value creation starts with strategy, and our strategy has not changed. We are determined to capture the long term secular trend disrupting the investment industry, such as rising demand for high quality data driven models and insights, increase transparency across asset classes and a more outcome oriented investment solutions. MSCI is commercializing these trends by providing indexed and rules based solutions, establishing standards in private assets, delivering comprehensive climate and sustainability tools, transforming risk and portfolio management and enabling personalized wealth management at scale. The evidence of our progress can be seen not only in MSCI's financial results but also in our high levels of client engagement. Over the past few months, Baer and I have met with clients across the United States, Europe and Asia. Everywhere we traveled, our clients and prospects were eager to talk about new areas of collaboration with MSCI. Our recent announcements and product launches highlight our strategy in action. For example, our strategic partnership with Moody's meaningfully expand the reach of our sustainability content among banks, insurance companies and corporates. It would also help us broaden our private company ESG coverage and expand our capabilities within private credit. Likewise, our recently launched MSCI private capital closed end fund indices will complement our real asset fund and property indices to deliver a wider view of private markets. This can also help us achieve our goal of becoming the global leader in private market indices. Meanwhile, MSCI AI Portfolio Insights combines generative artificial intelligence with advanced analytical tools and modeling capabilities to make it easier for clients to pinpoint the most important factors shaping investment risk and performance. We see tremendous potential across our newer client segments, such as wealth managers, general partners, insurance companies, corporates and corporate advisers. Wealth managers, in particular, have been excited to learn about our new technology platform acquired from Fabric earlier this year, which has dramatically increased our ability to support personalization at scale. This enabled us to close a large deal for these solutions during the second quarter. Meanwhile, our wealth subscription run rate across product lines grew by 12%, reaching $107 million. We had a strong quarter with asset owners and hedge funds as well, posting organic subscription run rate growth of 12% and 15%, respectively. All of this illustrates a key part of our strategy. We want to expand our footprint among large and rapidly growing client segment while strengthening our position among our more mature and traditional client segments, such as asset managers. To maximize that strategy, MSCI will continue developing mission critical solutions powered by advanced models, data and technology, including generative AI. All of this enables us to drive compounding growth and profitability for shareholders. And with that, let me turn the call over to Baer. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. And greetings, everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss our second quarter performance in greater detail with the focus on both product lines and client segments. Our performance shows how MSCI continues to balance long term strategy and short term execution. We designed our business plans for extended time horizons but we also do the hard work necessary to deliver for shareholders in the short term. Looking at our second quarter results. In Index, MSCI achieved 9% subscription run rate growth, including 10% growth in both EMEA and APAC and 17% growth in custom indexes and special package. In addition, direct investing AUM based on MSCI indexes is now $113 billion, up 28% year-over-year. We were also encouraged by our product with custom indexes. In Q2, we supported a large asset manager client in their launch of a new custom ETF climate series linked to the MSCI Transition Aware Select indexes. Meanwhile, we closed on our acquisition of Foxberry with an enhanced custom index platform launch underway for the second half of the year. Looking at global investment flows, we are encouraged that ETF products linked to MSCI indexes captured the highest cash flows in over two years with over $28 billion of inflows during the second quarter. In general, the depth and scale of tradable products linked to MSCI indexes continues to grow. During the quarter, we strengthened our position as a top index provider for ETF products as the number of launches of equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes nearly doubled year-over-year, translating to $2.5 billion in cash flows and nearly 30% share of new equity ETF fund flows. Open interest in derivatives linked to MSCI indexes is now nearly $300 billion, up 9% for the same period last year. Shifting to Analytics. We delivered another strong quarter across regions and business areas. Most notably, Analytics achieved our best ever Q2 for new recurring subscription sales at over $21 million and our best ever Q2 retention rate at close to 96%. We had a strong quarter with hedge funds, including a large win for our equity risk models to support the new clients' recent fund launch. Our offerings are supporting broad use cases, such as market risk, regulatory capital management, counterparty credit risk management, liquidity monitoring and investor reporting. We also drove $3.6 million in new recurring sales from asset owners, up 63% year-over-year to support their enterprise risk management. Amid an industry reimagining of risk management, risk teams and global investment firms are under pressure to find efficiencies, modernize services, all while harnessing the potential power of generative AI. We launched a new future risk product suite during Q2, including our MSCI AI Portfolio Insights tool, as Henry mentioned. This tool demonstrates how we can leverage our existing strengths and IP to drive innovation. It combines MSCI's deep history in natural language processing and machine learning with our industry leading data and risk and factor models. Turning to ESG and Climate. We delivered 14% run rate growth for the combined segment along with 30% climate run rate growth across our product [lines]. Our new game changing partnership with Moody's to offer MSCI's ESG and sustainability data to Moody's broad base of global clients reinforces MSCI as the market standard for ESG. The partnership will also help us expand our ESG and sustainability coverage for private companies. In addition, the Moody's partnership also confirms the continuing importance of sustainability considerations in global investing. MSCI continues to advance our product road map, including for regulatory solutions. Last month, for example, we launched a new data set to help issuers, advisers and corporates align with Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive or CSRD in Europe. In Climate, we released an important new product, MSCI GeoSpatial Asset Intelligence, which will help clients identify physical and nature based risks on more than 1 million locations for 70,000 public and private companies. With this product, we are once again using AI for data collection and mapping so that investors and lenders can better assess climate risks in their portfolios and loan books. Initial client interest is encouraging and we've already signed two deals, including with a large prominent private credit GP. In private assets, we're driving important products and client milestones. MSCI Private Capital Solutions subscription run rate is almost $106 million, which represents growth of 17% over Burgiss' performance in the same period last year prior to the acquisition and the retention rate was almost 93%. On the product side, we achieved a key milestone with the launch of MSCI Private Capital Indexes, which will accelerate our push to become a standard setter in private market, supporting investors seeking standardized economies and benchmarks to measure and evaluate private asset classes consistently. Given MSCI's global leadership and track record of success in indexing and benchmarking, clients have expressed significant interest in having us create benchmark indexes for private markets. Finally, in Real Assets, we posted run rate growth of 3% and a retention rate of 90%. While the commercial real estate market remains challenging, we are encouraged by client demand for products uncorrelated with transaction volumes, including portfolio services, index insights and climate, which enabled us to land almost $3 million of new recurring sales in Europe, growing 16% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we will continue aligning MSCI's long term strategy with secular trends and our competitive advantages while staying laser focused on short term execution. And with that, let me turn the call over to you, Andy.
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hi, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered 10% organic revenue growth, 14% adjusted EBITDA growth and 21% free cash flow growth. We are encouraged by the results, which reflect our unrelenting dedication to execution even in the face of market headwinds, which may persist in the short term. We are encouraged by the rebound in retention rates from the first quarter, which we did expect and we have not seen any deterioration in conditions. Although, we expect cancels to remain elevated in Q3 compared to last year and we expect somewhat longer sales cycles to persist in the short term. I also want to note that Q3 tends to be a seasonally softer quarter for us on the sales front. Within index, we grew our subscription run rate among asset managers and asset owners at 8% and 12% respectively. These segments collectively represent 68% of our index subscription run rate. Meanwhile, our index subscription run rate with wealth managers and hedge funds grew 11% and 24% respectively. Across index subscription modules, we saw another strong quarter from custom and special packages, growing 17%. ABF revenues were up 18% year-over-year, benefiting from $28 billion of cash inflows and about $21 billion of market appreciation and ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes during the second quarter. ETFs linked to our indexes continue to attract flows in non-U.S. exposures, particularly in developed markets outside the U.S. and in emerging markets, as we have seen a pickup in flows into ETFs with exposures outside the U.S. Fixed income ETFs AUM linked to MSCI and Bloomberg partnership indexes is now at $64 billion with year-to-date inflows of over $6 billion. Given strong recent equity market performance, non-ETF revenue in this quarter included the impact of true-ups related to higher reported client AUM and newly reported product launches. We reached a significant milestone in the quarter with AUM and ETFs and non-ETF passive products tracking MSCI indexes now surpassing $5 trillion. In Analytics, organic subscription run rate growth was 7% and revenue growth was 11%. The difference is largely attributable, once again, to the impact of recent client implementations, which continued from the last couple of quarters. As we've noted in the past, Analytics revenue growth can be lumpy because of items such as these implementations and we expect revenue growth rates to more closely align with run rate growth in Q3. In our ESG and climate reportable segment, organic run rate growth was 13%, which excludes the impact of FX and about $5 million of run rate from Trove. Q2 new recurring subscription sales for the segment included a significant contribution from the Moody's partnership. Regionally, the subscription run rate growth for the segment was 17% within Europe, 20% in Asia and 9% in the Americas. In Private Capital Solutions, year-over-year run rate growth was 17% and we continue to gain traction in key markets. New recurring sales in Europe reached a record and we also saw solid traction in sales with our GP client base. The Private Capital Solutions retention rate was approximately 93% and we recorded almost $27 million of revenue in the quarter. In Real Assets, run rate growth was roughly 3% with a retention rate slightly above 90%. We continue to have solid momentum in our Index Intel and our income and climate insights offerings, while we continue to see industry pressure impacting our transaction data offerings, including our RCA and property intel products, which we expect to continue to face headwinds in the near term. Our rigorous approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. Through yesterday, we have repurchased over $290 million or roughly 600,000 shares since late April. Our cash balance remains over $450 million, including readily available cash in the U.S. of more than $200 million. Turning to our 2024 guidance. We've increased our guidance for depreciation and amortization expense and operating expenses by $5 million, reflecting in part the impact of acquired intangible amortization expense from the Foxberry acquisition, which closed in April. I would note that our guidance assumes that ETF’s AUM levels increased slightly from June 30th levels through the end of the year. To the extent AUM levels track higher than this, we would expect to be towards the higher end of our expense guidance ranges. As of right now, we expect the quarterly effective tax rate in both Q3 and Q4 to be in the range of 20% to 22% before any additional discrete items. Before we open it up for questions, I want to underscore that we see tremendous opportunities with compelling secular trends. We see strong client engagement and tangible opportunities to drive growth. We see near term headwinds and client pressures but we continue to execute and drive leadership in these large addressable markets that will drive long term growth for us. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.
Alex Kramm: Just wanted to maybe unpack the strong sales growth in the quarter a little bit more. I mean last quarter, obviously, fairly soft and I think the tone even look forward still fairly somber. So maybe you could just help us what happens across the different segments. I mean did you gain more pricing, was it just timing that a lot of these maybe longer sales cycle deals closed or was the sales force really engaged after what happened last quarter? Just trying to understand the really strong results here after what's been a challenging environment.
Andy Wiechmann: So a few observations here. Firstly, I would remind you, and I think you know this, sales and cancels can both be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I would say that we haven't seen a deterioration in conditions. And I would say the sales in Q2 were solid, as you pointed out. I would also say that we haven't seen an inflection yet. Overall, we still see pressures on clients. We still see the longer sales cycle. So we would expect the lumpiness in sales and cancels to continue here. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Q3 can be a seasonally softer quarter for us. But as we've highlighted before, sustained momentum in equity markets is helpful to overall buying dynamics, although the impact on our subscription sales and op metrics more generally tends to lag the markets. I would highlight that we are seeing strong client engagement across the globe and we see it across most product areas and client segments. I think both the momentum in the equity markets and the strong client engagement should eventually lead to some momentum on the sales front. And so we're encouraged here but we remain cautious and expect some continued lumpiness.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: I wanted to ask about the Moody's partnership actually. It's a very interesting partnership. Sounds like a win-win. I know you alluded to a bit, Henry. But maybe just on context on why now and how the mechanics of the agreement works between the two of you? I presume there's like revenue sharing going on. And just quickly, Andy, I think you mentioned in your remarks that there was already some contribution from Moody's. I apologize, I missed that. If you could just help us with that.
Baer Pettit: So look, simply put, the deal is -- so first of all, maybe on a higher level, we've stated repeatedly here in the call and in various meetings with many of you that we're constantly on the lookout for partnerships. And I think this is a critical thing, which we hope will have a positive impact across our business in a variety of ways. So we started exploring with Moody's on a variety of fronts. And in essence, what we've come up with here is Moody's felt that we're being -- that us being a leader in ESG that they could use us significantly across a variety of their products, their services to their clients. And in turn, Moody's has an extraordinary private company database with a product they now call Orbis. And that's an area where we at MSCI have been really focused on trying to get better data and information for a variety of use cases, but notably for -- in ESG and Climate where that sort of company information can be very hard to get hold of. So that's kind of the two part -- the two sides, if you like, of the deal. We're very pleased with it mostly because -- well, overall, we think it's a great deal for both parties. But specifically, we were able to put this together very quickly in just a number of months with a true spirit of partnership with Moody's. So we see a lot of upside from this in the future.
Andy Wiechmann: And maybe if I could just touch on the second part of that question, Manav, about the economics. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the partnership has resulted in a significant contribution to new recurring sales in Q2. Unfortunately, I can't give more specifics. But I would highlight that we haven't seen any notable changes to the segment trends that we've been seeing in recent quarters.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: In the past couple of quarters, I think one of the debates that has emerged is the cyclical versus secular debate around the asset manager end market. And you've spoken about the challenges of tight budgets, which have intensified, I guess, over the past roughly two years. It seems like it's still going to be a little bit tough in 3Q. I guess what do you think the catalyst is for the change that we'll see at some point? Because I think that you are sort of alluding to this being more of a cyclical issue. And so what drives that change? And can you sustainably grow double digits in an environment that continues to be challenged or do you need that end market to sort of pick up?
Henry Fernandez: There are three big buckets in the global investment industry. There are the barbells on both sides. One is rules based systematic index investing, which continues to grow unabated. And on the other hand is very active, concentrated management, which obviously, the ultimate expression of that is private asset class management, private equity, private credit, private real estate, et cetera. But it does include concentrated portfolios, very thematic portfolios and things like that. And in the middle is the largest segment, the more traditional active management diversified widely -- a large number of shares, active management. That segment will continue to grow but at a slower pace than the two other ones and it will go through ups and downs. It will go through challenges and all of that. And we're going through a challenge with that segment right now. And we clearly have been relying on that segment for about 50-plus percent of our subscription revenues but rapidly increasing our penetration on index -- systematic rules based index management, which includes quantitative investing and index investing and all that and on the other hand, very active management, including our foray into private assets. So as we look into the future, I don't see us slowing down in our growth rate because we will definitely penetrate the traditional active management more and more, they're going to rely on us more and more in what they do even though it's an industry that is going through some difficulties right now cyclically. And we will increase our growth significantly in the other two sides, which is systematic rules based investing and private asset class investing.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital.
Ashish Sabadra: Andy, I just wanted to drill down further on the Index front and particularly, look, the slowdown in subscription growth, that is understood. But as we think about marching back into the low double digit growth over the midterm, I was wondering if you could help us parse how do you think about the market cap versus custom and direct indexing versus factor and thematic indices and how do you think about those growth profile? And thanks for flagging some of those wins for Fabric as well as the AUM for direct indexing. How should we think about the direct indexing? Right now, these direct custom indices are only 15% of Index subscription revenue. But how do we think about that over the next three to five years?
Andy Wiechmann: Ashish, a number of questions there. I'll try to touch on several of them. I would say -- and I think you alluded to this, if we focus on the Index subscription growth rate, we are seeing the slowdown now from softer recurring net new over the last few quarters, which is a reflection of the tougher environment and the pressures that we've talked about, although I would highlight that we are seeing resilience and momentum based on the second quarter results, which I think reinforces the long term opportunity for us. And if we double click on what's driving the growth and the outsized areas of growth across the Index franchise, I think it's similar to the drivers that we've seen in recent quarters. So we saw 8% growth in our market cap modules. But as you highlighted, 17% growth in our custom and special packages, which is a reflection of this move towards rules based systematic custom or outcome oriented type investing where indexes are a very effective and efficient mechanism to develop those strategies. We're well positioned to benefit there. If we look across client segments, we saw 8% growth with asset managers and more than 11% and 12% growth with wealth managers and asset owners and 24% growth with hedge funds. And so as Henry alluded to, we see tremendous opportunities in large part related to this move towards indexation in many different large client segments. And that trend is continuing and I think a reflection of a long term compelling secular opportunity for us. If we're going to focus on direct indexing, as you alluded to or asked about, I think direct indexing is mainly showing up in the non-ETF passive line for us. It is still very early in its evolution and it's a place where we are, I think, well positioned to help both wealth managers and asset managers that are serving wealth managers with direct indexing solutions to provide them not only the underlying indexes, which is where most of our run rate comes from today and most of our revenue comes from in that non-ETF passive line but also broader solutions that help them on that customization journey at scale. Fabric is an enabler there, our broader Analytics tools like our optimizers and risk models and things like our ESG content and climate content. So we are uniquely positioned to benefit from direct indexing, which I believe is still in its early days and will be a big opportunity longer term.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Alexander Hess from JPMorgan.
Alexander Hess: So there was a large deal in the private asset space involving one of your larger clients this quarter. Can you -- and one of the points touched on that was the opportunity for private indexes. Now MSCI is out talking about your own private index business and your own opportunity for Private Capital Indexes. But how do you think about the technical challenges to creating those sorts of indexes and gathering the data, and how has Private Capital Solutions been able to tackle some of those? And any comments about how to frame the demand and opportunity for that business would be appreciated as well.
Henry Fernandez: So thanks for that question, because we're very excited about what we're doing in private assets, in private capital and real assets as we look at the differences between the two of them. So as you know, we announced yesterday the launch of 130 private capital indices, private equity, private debt, private credit, private infrastructure, et cetera. And we already have about 80 or so real property or real asset indices, both at the fund level and at the asset level. So we're very excited about that launch. The technical challenges and opportunities first [come] with the data, access to the data. So MSCI now has access to about $15 trillion worth of underlying data across all private assets. And that is the highest quality data that exists in the plane, because it comes directly from the GP at the request of the LP. So we have that enormous amount of data. So the private capital indices that we announced yesterday are built on about $11 trillion of that $15 trillion and the other $3 trillion, $4 trillion, say, is what the other real asset indices are built upon. So it starts with that. Then secondly is the -- your understanding of the investment process and the methodologies that you need to do to create the indices. And we've written the book about index construction and index methodologies throughout the last 50 or so years. So there is no question that we're an expert on that. And the third technical challenge is, do you have the distribution associated with that in terms of the asset owners and the asset managers, the allocators and the managers of assets. And we have 1,200 people at MSCI calling on pretty much every one of those clients around the world. So that is important. I think a key part of this thing is obviously as well independent, people want to see their indices and other tools come from an independent source. And obviously, MSCI has excelled in that in terms of quality and in terms of independence and in terms of a robust and transparent methodology, et cetera. So we feel pretty confident that we will be the leader in all aspects of private assets from the data to the tools. And the tools include the benchmark indices, the performance attribution, the risk models, liquidity, evaluated prices, portfolio construction, asset allocation, et cetera, et cetera. And that's what we're setting out to do with the completion of the Burgiss acquisition on top of the RCA acquisition and on top of our position in Real Assets before that, we feel pretty good about where we are.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.
Owen Lau: So the broader market was quite strong in the first half and probably better than the initial market assumption. And I'm just wondering what else you would like to see so that you can [raise] your full year free cash flow guidance?
Andy Wiechmann: So the cash flow performance has been strong for us. It was strong in the second quarter. I think we've benefited from both high collections compared to a year ago and lower cash tax payments. I would highlight on the guidance front that there are a lot of factors that can impact free cash flow. Everything from billings and collections across both subscription and ABF. Obviously, a higher ABF environment does help us, although ABF, we tend to bill on a lag. And then cash expenses and cash tax payments can swing quite a bit. We're only halfway through the year. And we are continually focused on driving strong free cash flow growth and strong free cash flow conversion, but I would highlight that it can swing quarter-to-quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America.
Heather Balsky: Last quarter, during the call, you talked about your thoughts around margin expansion going forward, and I think the message was you expect sort of more modest expansion. As we think through the strong growth you're seeing with regards to AUM, how are you thinking about reinvesting that, has your thoughts changed anyway from last quarter? And if you were to sort of accelerate investments, where are you most focused?
Andy Wiechmann: So Heather, I would say we are not focused on and we don't target a specific margin expansion or margin level. What we are continually doing is balancing investing for the long term while driving attractive profitability and free cash flow growth. And so that is the calibration that we are continually focused on and driving. I would highlight the comments that I made in the prepared remarks here where as you alluded to, AUM levels have been running higher than what underlied our guidance in previous quarters. And we've assumed for the current guidance that AUM levels increased slightly from the 6/30 balances. And if AUMs track above that, we will likely be at the high end of our expense guidance ranges. We would use the higher growth to invest in key areas in the business as we have in the past and those key areas tend to cut across the big growth frontiers that we're talking about. And so from a solutions standpoint, very focused on the custom index front and that's a broad topic involving everything from technology to researchers to go to market. We do have investments in the climate front. There are a number of opportunities across private assets and private capital that we are investing in. And so we are laser focused on continuing to drive these long term growth drivers while at the same time continuing to squeeze to run the business expenses and identify efficiencies in the business. But it's a [constant] calibration for us and we are calibrating based on not only AUM levels but overall business performance, outlook and financial dynamics more generally and we'll keep you posted on that.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: So I wanted to follow up on the environment that you're seeing out there, specifically in ESG and Climate, because it sounds like there was a pretty significant increase in new recurring subscription sales growth. And I know you alluded to the Moody's partnership that may have driven a chunk of that growth. But then I also heard you talk about sort of new products around CSRD. So give us a bit more around what you're expecting for ESG and if the underlying environment is any different or has improved.
Andy Wiechmann: So I would say we've seen a continuation of the dynamics that we've been seeing in recent quarters. There haven't been major changes to the trends that you've been seeing and we've been seeing. I think we highlighted this, but from a regional standpoint segment -- within the segment run rate growth in the Americas was about 9%, is about 17% in EMEA and 20% in APAC, which is generally in line with what we saw last quarter. And the themes that we're seeing in each of the regions is fairly consistent with what we've seen in the past. In the U.S., we're still seeing investors take a more measured pace on how they're integrating ESG. That's causing longer sales cycles and more deliberate purchasing decisions. In EMEA, we do see opportunities, as you alluded to, in areas like regulations. So we've had some early wins with things like CSRD and EBA Pillar 3. But regulation at the same time is creating some complexity and confusion as it cuts across many different objectives from financial materiality to do no harm to specific climate objectives. And so that is resulting in some hesitancy for many clients. And then in Asia, we are seeing solid engagement and it feels like Asia is earlier in its adoption of ESG. And so very similar trends to what we've seen in the past. I would highlight that the industry pressures that impact all parts of the business are probably more impactful within the ESG and Climate segments where we serve such a wide range of client types and use cases, and users that there probably are similar nice-to-have type use cases that will get impacted more significantly from environmental pressures. We expect these dynamics to persist in the short term but we remain encouraged by the long-term dynamics here. And so as I alluded to, areas like regulation are compelling opportunities and we've seen some early wins, but also opportunities in some of the new offering areas that Baer highlighted around our asset level physical risk and nature data sets, our offering with the GeoSpatial Explorer is quite exciting, very early days, but these are things that continue to add value to our clients. And on top of that, we still see climate as a very dynamic area that has tremendous opportunities across not only new solution sets but client segments for us. And so as Henry alluded to, opening up opportunities in areas like banks, insurance companies, corporates directly, even opportunities with GPs. And so there are a wide range of opportunities we are excited about in the long term, but in the short term, no change in the dynamics and we expect it to continue in the short term.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Your Analytics business had another strong quarter, including strong new recurring subscription sales and retention rates. What are the top factors enabling this performance and how sustainable is double digit organic growth in Analytics?
Andy Wiechmann: So I would say -- and you've noticed this in the results of the last several quarters, we've seen some good momentum. So we're seeing strong client engagement across many different parts of our analytical tools. There's probably some benefit from the environment driving an intense focus on investment risk and credit risk and liquidity risk and we are a leader on all fronts, and so that definitely has been helpful to us in certain areas. The performance is also driven in part by the enhancements and innovations that we've continued to deliver. So we've been seeing traction with our Insights offering, which delivers our risk analytics through a modern data architecture with enhanced visualization. And as you know, we've now integrated AI capabilities into that and that's an area where we do see strong client engagement, and we've seen some traction in enabling new sales for us. We've seen solid sales within our fixed income offering and see opportunities -- continue to see opportunities there. And we continue to see strong momentum with our equity analytics business or equity risk models, which is something we've highlighted in recent quarters. So a lot of the same drivers we've talked about in the past that has been encouraging. We continue to see opportunities. Although, I will say that it's likely to be lumpy, and some of the pressures that have impacted the broader company are likely to impact Analytics as well.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel from Wolfe Research.
Scott Wurtzel: I wanted to stay on the Analytics segment and maybe talk about the margin that you were seeing there. Obviously, it's pretty notable expansion, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. So just wondering if you can maybe walk us through and maybe drill down into the drivers of that notable margin expansion in Analytics?
Andy Wiechmann: We've commented on this in the past. There are several factors that drive the Analytics margin and have driven it higher over the last several years. So one is we have been capitalizing software. And so the level of capitalized software has picked up a bit, which will drive the EBITDA margin. It doesn't impact the operating margin, but does impact the EBITDA margin. Broader expense efficiencies and expense discipline that we have across the company tends to impact the Analytics segment, just given how we do many of our allocations. I would also highlight there are parts of the Analytics business that we have invested less in as well. We've been very strategic and targeted with the parts of Analytics that we have been investing in, but there have been some parts that we have invested less in to allow us to invest in other parts of the company that are very strategic for us. And so all those factors have contributed to the Analytics margin increasing over time. As you can tell by the growth, we do see very compelling opportunities within Analytics that are not only attractive growth opportunities in their own right but they are very strategic for driving growth across the company. And so we do have investment opportunities in Analytics that we will be putting money into and continue to invest in.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.
Craig Huber: Just wanted to ask you guys a question on AI here. And so can you give us some examples of where you're really excited about the uses of AI to help drive revenues long term? And also a similar question on the cost efficiency side, where AI can really help you on the cost side, help your margins out even better.
Baer Pettit: So look, both of those areas are really critical and we're engaging on both fronts quite dramatically. So first of all, in terms -- and I would say that within the efficiency, the cost efficiency, there's also even what you could call like a quality efficiency story, notably in our whole data environment. So we're doing tremendous amounts of work across the board in data, data calculations, production, extraction, whether that’d be in private markets, in ESG and Climate across the board, notably in areas that can be difficult to find hard data in such as controversies. So we're moving ahead in all those areas. And we have been -- we've had a really special focus on this, both internally and with certain members of our Board of Directors who happily have some expertise in this area. So the efficiency area is one where we're starting to see some pretty attractive numbers. As Andy mentioned, this is a continuous effort. And as we typically go into the end of the year here and start setting budgets for next year, we're starting to see that AI efficiencies o probably for the first year, next year will be a nontrivial part of our budgeting exercise and the efficiencies we can make. In terms of new product development, this is also very much across the board. We clearly have two examples which we brought out today, which are sort of live, if you like, which is the work on GeoSpatial data where really we wouldn't have been able to do that without the use of AI and the recent launch as part of our future of risk. By the way, you may want to just Google future of risk MSCI, there's a very interesting paper on our Web site, which goes into the whole use of AI in the future of risk and you can download it for free. So in Analytics, in ESG and Climate and pretty much in private market. So there's no part of the business where we're not using AI. And I think both in terms of a new product development and an efficiency story, we hope to be able to give you -- increasing the specific information in the quarters ahead and going into next year.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic.
Russell Quelch: Congratulations on a strong Q2 result. I wanted to focus on private asset benchmarks, if I can. I wondered if you could size the current addressable market you see there and the rate at which you think that market is growing. And also if you could talk to the competitive dynamics, is this mainly white space for you guys or is there others that you'll be looking to displace as you grow? And finally, do you have all the data assets you need to grow now or are you looking further to sort of inorganic growth opportunities, particularly around data in this area?
Henry Fernandez: So there are -- on the benchmark themselves, there are two sources of value to us. The first one is the sales themselves in benchmarking for LPs and GPs in the various subsectors -- or I should say, the various asset classes within private assets. One of the biggest providers of private credit in the world that I met with recently said, I needed benchmark to be able to get more assets from both the institutional LPs and the wealth management part. So that will create revenue opportunities. We haven't yet created a dimension of how much that will be and the timing of that, but that's clearly one area. The second one and probably even bigger area is that if we become -- by becoming the leading provider of private asset class benchmarks, it puts us right in the center of the ecosystem of the LPs and the GPs and the underlying assets that they invest in. And in that center stage inside the tent, so to speak, then we're able to then expand from there to provide performance attribution models, risk management models, liquidity models, valuation models, obviously, asset allocation models and all of that. And of course, it will put [Technical Difficulty] key position to provide the underlying data as well, but that's part of, the benchmark sales. And therefore, it puts us in an enormously advantageous position. And that's what we've done throughout our 50 plus year history, that's why we expanded since I created the company 30 years ago, and we built it upon the market cap indices created by the Capital Group and Morgan Stanley. So we're very excited about what we can do in the overall private capital, private asset investing in the world. Obviously, all of this is totally alluding to transparency, to understanding what you bought, to understanding the risk -- the sources of risk and return on what you got and to create a seamless understanding of asset allocation across private assets and public assets. So a unit of risk in a building, in a bridge or in private credit or in a venture capital company can be identified easily and compare easily with a unit of risk in a public company and a public bond or in a hedge fund. So that's what we're going after.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gregory Simpson from BNP Paribas.
Gregory Simpson: Can I just quickly check in on the latest contribution of pricing to new sales across Index and the other segments, and if there's any client behavioral changes around pricing [Technical Difficulty]?
Andy Wiechmann: So I would say across the company, the contribution of price increases was slightly smaller than last year, so very consistent with what we said last quarter. We have been slightly moderating our price increases in many places, given the pricing and economic environment, which is very much in line with what we said last quarter. I'd say importantly and I want to underscore this, we are focused on aligning price increase with the value that we are delivering. And so we do factor in the overall pricing environment and client health but we also are focused on ensuring that we're capturing the value for the enhancements that we make to our solutions and our service, and balancing that as well with the long term relationship with our clients. So most of our growth is going to come from existing clients. And so we are very focused on being a strong long term partner to our clients. And that means adding value, that means selling more to them, providing enhanced services to them and that will translate through to enhanced price increases but also translates through to additional services that we can deliver to them. And so we're continually balancing that value with price increases.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.
Alex Kramm: Just a quick follow-up on the sales environment as I asked about earlier. When you think about the second half, and I know it's maybe a little bit too specific. But if you compare to last year's, maybe sales in dollars, are you still comfortable or are you comfortable that you can do more sales this year in the second half or anything specific to 3Q or 4Q?
Andy Wiechmann: So as I mentioned, 3Q, and I know you're aware of this, Alex, 3Q is typically a softer quarter for us, seasonally softer quarter for us from a sales perspective. Q4 tends to be a seasonally strong quarter for us. I don't want to be too specific or prescriptive about what can happen. As I mentioned, sales and cancels can both be lumpy and we do see some challenging dynamics out there. But as I alluded to earlier, we are seeing strong client engagement. We see opportunities out there. And as we've seen in past cycles, if there is sustained momentum in the equity markets that tends to translate through over time into more favorable buying dynamics for clients. But as I said earlier, we are cautious. We still see some pressures on clients. But overall, we do see opportunities as well.
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Henry Fernandez, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: So as you heard in our commentary, we're intensely focused on executing our grand strategy and compounding growth quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year and that's what we do. We're not an entity, as you know well, that flares up and flares down. We are consistently executing and executing. And there'll be some quarters that are going to be very strong relative to expectations, some of the quarters that are going to be weaker. But the longer trend horizon of this company is extremely powerful compounding of growth and compounding on profitability. We're very excited by the very large growth opportunities in front of us as you heard in the commentary and answers to your questions and are encouraged by a very high level of client engagement that is typically a leading indicator of sales in the future. So we look forward to engaging with all of you over the next few months. And thank you again for joining us and I hope you all enjoy the summer and take some time off.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investors Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you. Good day and welcome to the MSCI first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2024. This press release, along with an earnings presentation and brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements, which are governed by the language on the second slide of today’s presentation. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today’s call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures. You will find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the equivalent GAAP measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss operating metrics such as run-rate and retention rate. Important information regarding our use of operating metrics such as run-rate and retention rate are available in the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; and Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. As a final housekeeping item, we want to remind our analysts to ask one question at a time during the Q&A portion of our call. We do encourage you to ask more questions by adding yourselves back to the queue. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Good day, everyone and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, MSCI delivered solid financial results that demonstrate the resilience of our business and our ability to maintain profitable growth supported by durable secular trends. Our operating metrics included some key product and segment milestones. But new recurring sales were flat from last year’s levels and reflect the lagging effect of market pressures on client budgets and cancels were meaningfully elevated in some concentrated areas. On the financial side, MSCI achieved organic revenue growth of 10%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 12%, and free cash flow growth of 14%. Meanwhile, our ABF revenue grew by 13%, powered by record AUM balances in both ETFs and non-listed products linked to MSCI indices. We consider AUM levels in MSCI index-linked products as a leading indicator of improving client conditions. Operationally, we delivered our highest Q1 recurring sales in analytics in a decade at $14 million, our best ever Q1 of recurring sales among hedge funds at nearly $11 million and another quarter of double-digit subscription run-rate growth of 11% among asset owners, driven by index and analytics. Non-recurring sales of $18 million were up 16%. At the same time, our first quarter results show the lingering impact of market volatility, changes in interest rate expectations and pressures on investment and financial firms, especially active equity managers. Notably, MSCI witnessed elevated cancels which reflected a concentration of unusual client events. Roughly $7 million worth of cancels came from a single client event, a historic merger of two major global banks in Europe that affected us across index, ESG and analytics. While some client pressures may continue, we do not expect this high level of cancels to continue. In fact, we remain greatly encouraged by our high levels of engagement across all client segments and all geographies. Despite the tough Q1 operating environment for us, we delivered double-digit organic subscription run-rate growth among asset owners, hedge funds, wealth managers and corporates. Among asset managers, redemption, outflow and fee pressures continue to weigh on some managers, but we were able to deliver 7% organic subscription run-rate growth with that segment. In addition, we achieved 39% climate run-rate growth across our product lines, driven by APAC and EMEA regions. Likewise, APAC and EMEA helped stabilize our ESG run-rate growth at 12%, amid continued headwinds in the Americas. Meanwhile, amid a strong U.S. dollar, the benefits of our non-dollar expenses helped offset FX-related revenue headwinds. MSCI’s all-weather franchise supports our financial resilience. Our diverse mix of clients, products and geographies helped stabilize our performance in difficult environments as we experienced in the first quarter. Looking ahead to the extent equity markets and high AUM balances and liquidity levels remain supportive that should mitigate certain pressures that have weighed on client spending on MSCI products. We remain keenly focused on capitalizing on the biggest secular trends reshaping our industry such as portfolio customization and indexation, the growth of an increasing allocations to private assets, and the global sustainability revolution. Just last week, we closed our acquisition of the London-based index provider Foxberry. This will give us a new technology platform to accelerate custom index production while providing simulation and back testing capabilities for the creation of indices for institutional investors and intermediaries. Turning to our other recent acquisitions, combining the Fabric platform with MSCI factor risk models, ESG and climate data and indices, has dramatically enhanced our capabilities and solutions for the wealth segment. Finally, the MSCI carbon markets team, formerly Trove Research has expanded our climate solutions and deepened our engagement with existing and prospective clients beyond institutional investors, such as corporates, trading desks and banks. Considering the lagging effect of market volatility that our clients and MSCI are faced, we expect our all-weather franchise to continue to withstand external challenges such as the client events we saw in Q1. This makes us confident that MSCI can maintain high levels of revenue growth and profitability in 2024 and beyond. And with that, let me turn the call over to Baer. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss some of the key sources of strength in our first quarter results at both the product and segment levels while putting our results in a broader strategic perspective. First, I would like to expand a bit on Henry’s comments about our elevated cancels. As he noted, the vast majority of our first quarter cancels stem from kind events such as industry consolidation, cost pressures, fund closures and reorganization. Excluding the single client event from a bank merger, our Q1 retention rate across MSCI was 94%. Clients who use multiple MSCI product lines account for 85% of our total subscription run rate. The Q1 retention of those clients on average is 93% or higher. Turning to our product and segment results. As demand for Index Investments continues to grow, the product ecosystem linked to MSCI indexes remains a competitive advantage, especially as more-and-more investors push for customized products. In the first quarter, assets under management in equity ETF products linked to MSCI indexes hit a new record high of $1.58 trillion, while AUM in non-listed products linked to MSCI indexes also set a record of $3.23 trillion. We also delivered index subscription run rate growth of 9.3%, including 12% growth in Asia-Pacific and 24% growth among hedge funds. The 24% subscription run rate growth in index among hedge funds was driven primarily by our Float Data Product and Custom Index Sales. Meanwhile, our custom and special index run rate growth was 19%. MSCI’s recent acquisition of Foxberry will further enhance our wide range of custom index solutions and provide a new client-centric interactive experience. The trend towards greater customization cuts across all product lines and client segments. For example, wealth managers increasingly want to customize their client portfolios using advanced technology platforms. That is what motivated MSCI acquisition of Fabric whose platform is now part of our analytics offering. Combined with our total portfolio toolkit, the Fabric platform has already boosted our ability to serve the wealth segment and the feedback from clients has been extremely positive. Our run rate among wealth managers has now surpassed $100 million, growing over 15% year-on-year. The push for customization is closely related to another shift in the analytics space. Clients have always depended on us for risk and performance attribution tools but they now want highly specialized insights and deeply integrated content, all supported by leading-edge technology, including generative AI. Our analytics team has massive demand through products such as our multi-asset class factor models, our risk insights and risk manager solutions and our MSCI ONE platform built on Microsoft Azure. As we have recently seen, these tools can become even more relevant amid market volatility, cyclical pressures and geopolitical uncertainty. In the first quarter, Analytics posted revenue growth of 12% and our highest Q1 in a decade for recurring new sales. At the product level, recurring sales of our RiskManager tool were up by 60% and included a large strategic win with a major global alternative asset manager facilitated by our Risk Insights offering. At the segment level, Analytics achieved recurring sales growth of 27% among banks, 20% among hedge funds and 15% among asset owners. Rising demand for highly specialized analytics tools intersects with growing client needs for climate and sustainability regulatory solutions. This represents an attractive opportunity for MSCI, and we have doubled down on our efforts to capture it. Our first quarter run rate growth for ESG Regulatory Solutions was 33%. To build on this momentum, we have enhanced our solutions for the EU sustainable finance disclosure regulation while developing a new solution with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, or CSRD. In addition, we will continue exploring untapped opportunities in APAC, where we achieved 18% ESG run rate growth in the first quarter. In MSCI Private Capital Solutions, we achieved a run rate growth of 17% over Burgiss performance in the same period last year prior to the acquisition and a retention rate of close to 96%. We had early momentum in EMEA, which accounted for over half of new client wins in the product segment. We continue to drive new recurring sales of key existing products such as private capital transparency data and total plan portfolio management. We’re also making progress on our integrated product road map, including evaluated pricing for LPs and GPs, leveraging MSCI’s data models and research. In summary, MSCI remains laser focused on translating our long-term strategy into near-term delivery while harnessing competitive advantages and secular trends. And with that, let me turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hi, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth, a 11% adjusted EBITDA growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth as well as record asset-based fee revenue driven by record AUM balances in ETF and non-ETF products linked to MSCI indexes. The solid financial performance highlights the resilience of our business model, even in the face of headwinds reflected in our operating metrics. As we have mentioned previously, we are seeing the impacts of a slow-moving business cycle as the prolonged period of muted flows into active equity strategies have resulted in a lengthening of sales cycles. And in this quarter, a concentration of client events on top of what is typically a seasonally softer quarter for us. To provide a bit more color, if we compare our cancels to the first quarter of 2023, the two product segments with the biggest increases were index and ESG and climate. Within index, nearly the entirety of the increase or roughly $7 million of the increase related to a higher contribution from corporate events. From a client segment index, $5.2 million of the year-over-year increase in cancels came within the broker-dealer and hedge fund client segments, including roughly $4 million from the previously mentioned large global bank merger. Similarly, within ESG and climate, nearly $4 million or 80% of the increase in cancels came from a higher level of corporate events, including $2.5 million from the large global bank merger event. The large majority of cancels related to this global bank merger occurred in Q1, although there could be some smaller items that come through in future quarters as the integration is completed. Across all product segments, the retention rate with asset owners and asset managers was a 95% and 97%, respectively. While we do expect some elevated levels of client events to continue in the near-term, we do not expect to see cancels continue at this level in the coming quarters, and we expect retention rates to rebound through the year. Additionally, we have a solid pipeline of new sales opportunities. In Index, we had 8% subscription run rate growth in our market cap weighted modules and 19% growth in custom indexes and special packages. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, we had a large non-recurring revenue item related to unlicensed usage of our indexes, which drove an unusually large level of non-recurring revenue. ABF revenues were up 13% year-over-year, benefiting from about $21 billion of cash inflows and about $93 billion of market appreciation so far in 2024 with an ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes. Most of the MSCI-linked ETF flows were in developed markets outside the U.S. and emerging markets products, which together were over $22 billion. In Analytics, organic subscription run rate growth was 7%, which reflects the benefits from the investments we’ve made in the innovations such as our next-gen models and our Insights offering. These have helped us to drive strong sales and enterprise risk and multi-asset class models across client segments. We also had several client wins in fixed income analytics. Analytics revenue this quarter included a large contribution from catch-up revenue items, much of which related to large client implementations. In our ESG and Climate reportable segment, organic run rate growth was 13%, which excludes about $4.8 million of run rate from Trove and the impact of FX and run rate growth for the reportable ESG and Climate segment was nearly 18% within Europe and close to 22% in Asia, while the Americas growth was 9%. In real assets, run rate growth was about 4% with subdued net new subscription sales continuing to reflect lower transaction activity and other commercial real estate pressures. We continue to be pleased with our progress on the integration of Burgiss, which, as a reminder, is referred to as the Private Capital Solutions operating segment within our all other private assets reportable segment. Retention was strong at nearly 96% and contributed over $24 million of revenue for the quarter. We continue to have a vigilant focus on disciplined capital allocation and our cash balance at the end of March was over $500 million, including readily available cash in the U.S. of over $200 million. Last week, we closed on the acquisition of Foxberry for approximately $22 million of upfront consideration. The transaction also has the potential for additional performance-related payments tied to the achievement of key milestones. Our 2024 guidance across all categories remains unchanged and assumes that AUM declines slightly in Q2 and rebounds gradually in the second half of the year. I would note that our first quarter effective tax rate of 13.5% benefited from favorable discrete items and higher excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based comp vested in the period. For the remainder of the year, we expect the quarterly effective tax rate of 21% to 22% each quarter before any discrete items. Overall, our client centricity and multiyear investments position us well to drive growth throughout 2024, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Sure. You bet. I wanted to talk about the closures. Thank you for giving the segment breakout for the large client event. Just it sounds to me like that is now in the numbers, but I wanted to just confirm that there isn’t going to be more. And just more in general around the non-UBS event, like it sounded like maybe there were more closures of asset managers that you saw in the quarter. So do you expect that to improve throughout the year? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Hey, Toni, it’s Andy. So on the large global bank merger, as we mentioned, the large bulk of the cancels related to that merger occurred in Q1. We did have some small items in previous quarters. And there could be some smaller items that trickle through as the integration continues later in the year, but we don’t expect it to be anywhere close to what we saw in Q1 here. Just more generally, I would underscore that retention rates among asset managers and asset owners remain healthy, so at 95% and 97%, respectively. And maybe I can provide a little bit more color on the elevation and cancels that we saw in Q1 in addition to what I mentioned on the prepared remarks here. So of the $7.6 million increase we saw in index, $7 million, so the large majority of that came from client events or these corporate events that we alluded to, $4 million of that attributable to this global bank merger. Beyond that, we did see a concentration of hedge fund-related events. So strategy changes, closures, team departures that all came together in the first quarter here. Similarly, other area where we saw an increase in cancels year-over-year was ESG and climate. And as I mentioned, 80% of the increase year-over-year came from higher level of corporate events, including $2.5 million from the global bank merger that we’ve been alluding to. And so there really was this acute bunching of events that occurred during the first quarter here. And as we alluded to, we don’t expect this level of cancels to continue going forward?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. At the risk of kind of almost asking the same thing, wondering in particular, as it comes to the asset management end market, which is still your largest client set, what you’re seeing and what gives you confidence that things are getting better? I mean it sounds like markets are getting better, and that should be a leading indicator. But at the same time, it seems like you guys have historically said that you’re doing really, really well with the largest asset managers, but there’s a smaller set that I think continues to really struggle with flows and just the overall environment. So I guess the question is, why are you not worried that, that smaller end of the asset management market is structurally challenged and could structurally hit you and then it comes back. I mean you talked to a lot of the clients all the time. So just wondering what you’re hearing.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. And so as we’ve mentioned before, Alex, budgets were set for this year last year when it was a tough environment. And so we are seeing the impacts of tighter budgets on sales cycles, buying decisions and the overall selling environment on top of what is typically a seasonally soft quarter for us in Q1. As we’ve alluded to, we are seeing strong engagement among asset managers, and we are focused on helping them where we can, which means selling more to them. And so we continue to view them as a key opportunity for us in a key area where we see attractive growth as they reposition their business models for the future, and you can see that in the elevated growth in areas like our custom and special packages, and so we continue to have the steady growth of 8% with asset managers. And when you look at across the module types, we’ve got the outsized growth in some of these key areas that asset managers are moving towards. So we would expect, as you alluded to, sustained momentum in equity markets to be a positive factor and be something that continues to be constructive to buying behavior. But this has been a slow moving cycle, and I think it will take some time to work through. But I would also highlight that we see large and growing demand across other segments. And we see that with new solutions and existing solutions, and we hope that will continue to build as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I guess my question is broadly on visibility. So maybe just a two-parter. First, all these elevated cancellations that occurred in the first quarter, when, I guess, did you guys know that was going to happen. Like how much in advance do they typically give you notice? And then similarly, like looking ahead, you talked about a lot of client engagement, selling them new business, but then you also talked about lengthening sales cycles. So maybe just your thoughts on when we could see these engagements convert to bookings and show a pickup in the numbers.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. So on the first point about visibility, listen, we do have some visibility into the overall level of activity. And so as we’ve alluded to in the past, we’ve been seeing some elevated levels of pressure from our clients. And we’ve been expecting an elevated contribution from client events. But the exact timing of when they occur, we don’t always know. And so we did not expect this type of concentration in the first quarter here. We had this bunching of cancels that ended up occurring altogether. And as a result, we don’t expect this level of cancels to continue going forward. We do expect some elevated level of client activity just given the environment, but we are expecting retention rates to rebound through the year here and move more towards what we saw last year as we move towards the latter part of this year. In terms of outlook on the sales side and visibility into the longer-term pipeline, listen, as I mentioned, we do have a solid pipeline. We’ve got solid engagement from clients. And at the same time, we are seeing just longer sales cycles and these budget constraints. And so to the extent and when the pressures begin to alleviate that should translate through into, I think, encouraging growth for us. And as I alluded to in the last question, it’s not just in our core products, but we do see opportunities in newer solutions that we have as well as in many of these client segments that are a little less exposed to some of the cyclical dynamics that we’re talking about.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Hess with JPMorgan.
Alexander Hess: Yes. Hi, I was wondering if you could break down the growth in index subscription run rate year-on-year into sort of pricing upsell, cross-sell, new business wins? And then maybe some comments on what you expect for those line items as the year progresses. Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Sure. Hey, Alex. So on the pricing front, I would highlight that we, and we’ve alluded to this in the past, that we had a lower contribution on a dollar amount and on a percentage level from price increases within new subscription sales. It’s important to underscore that we continue to be very measured with our increases. It is an important lever for us, and we do want to make sure we’re capturing the value that we are delivering to clients, but we do factor in the overall pricing environment as well as client health. And so the contribution from price increase was a little bit more modest relative to what we saw last year. The balance of new subscription sales was largely related to what we would call cross-selling or upselling, so delivering more solutions to existing clients that is the bulk of sales in the quarter, and we believe a key to our growth going forward. And so that strong engagement with clients is encouraging because we do believe we can continue to sell more to them. As we’ve alluded to, when you break down the components of growth here, we saw 8% growth within our market cap modules. We saw 19% growth in custom and special packages. And we saw across client segments outsized growth, continue to see outsized growth with asset owners and wealth managers and very strong growth despite this bunching of some hedge fund events despite that bunching, we continue to see strong growth among hedge funds as well. So the growth is multifaceted, and I think many of the drivers of long-term opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to drill down further on the ESG and Climate segment. I was wondering if you could talk about how some of the new regulations in Europe, particularly CSRD could potentially help influence the demand for the products going forward. But also, have you seen any incremental headwinds of politicization of ESG in the U.S.? And lastly, on the climate side, how should we think about the growth momentum there. Thanks.
Baer Pettit:
[34:44]Ashish[indiscernible]: So those are my observations, both related to regulation and the way that we want to bring our ESG focus back to financial materiality where it started.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.
Owen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So, going back to Slide 9 and thank you for putting together this slide, it mentioned that 85% of subscription run rate subscribing to multiple product lines. Could you please talk about the historical pattern for this percentage? Has it been going up or down or relatively flat. Also, what does it take to increase the engagement with your clients to increase the product line from one product to, let’s say, more than one? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I would say, Owen, that we have historically seen outsized retention with our largest clients as well as those clients that are subscribing to multiple products. It’s a key part of our strategy and has been a key part of our strategy for many years. As you’re probably aware, we have had a more strategic selling effort with these large accounts, we have what we call senior account managers and key account managers across the organization where we agree. We engage holistically with them. And so we’re engaging typically at the C levels of these organizations talking to them about what their objectives are and how MSCI can help them achieve those objectives. And that not only leads to higher engagement and retention rates over time, but it also leads to additional selling opportunities. And so the beauty of MSCI is, our solutions are interoperable. We run an integrated franchise where our indexes are built on the same framework as our risk models and our ESG ratings and research and so we can more effectively help these clients achieve their investment objectives over time and help them operate more efficiently. And so this strategic selling effort has been integral to that. And as you can see by the figures that we put on Slide 9 here, it’s critical to driving that higher level of retention and continued growth among these larger organizations around the globe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research.
Kelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to talk about custom index products for a second. So this segment saw a really strong run rate growth of 19%. I was wondering if we can get your thoughts around the total addressable market for this product and kind of medium-term run rate growth for this segment. Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Yes. I don’t have an exact number for total addressable market in front of me right now. But what I would say is that the range of use cases for customization is very broad. It ranges from asset owners of various different descriptions who require customized benchmarks for their portfolios. And in turn, those could be very different depending on the client type, whether it’s an insurance company or a pension fund or an endowment. It then, of course, links to asset managers both for those institutional mandates and for mutual funds. There is a very large market for structured products which in turn is linked to our Wealth segment strategy. So, it’s really the structured products where the investment banks are building products for wealth distribution. And so when we look across the entire sort of ecosystem this demand for customization is driven by different client types, different use cases, but also by different underlying ingredients. And so as we have more components, different asset classes, different types of content, such as ESG and climate and different types of strategies, there is a very large upside here. So, we are very excited by this and our relatively modest-sized acquisition of Foxberry, which we think will be a great addition is going to help us accelerate that by building on our sort of our great industry quality and reputation with a nimble new software interface, which will help us bring product to market even faster.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. This question is for Henry. Henry, can you discuss how you are strategically balancing reinvestments to support long-term growth initiatives with near-term margin performance, specifically, to what extent do you believe MSCI will be entering a new investment cycle that could fuel strong pursuit of new growth initiatives at the potential expense of near-term margins?
Henry Fernandez: That’s definitely the key balancing act that we play at MSCI every year. How do we balance continued high levels of profitability for our shareholders with investments that are going to drive significant revenue growth in the future. So, the first thing that we do, George, is that – the first thing we would try to do is we try to keep the level of investment every year despite any headwinds, and we do that by creating even more efficiency and at some point, hitting our compensation expenses to keep that high level of investment within the year. The second thing that we do is that we tried to increase that level of rate of growth of investment on a year-over-year basis at a rate, say, double the non-investment expenses in the company so that we continue to feed the funding of significant growth opportunities we have ahead of us. The third thing that we do is, we believe that having short-term pressures and having short-term, meaning within a year or so within a few quarters or a year, discipline of maintaining higher levels of profitability is actually a positive, not a negative because it helps us focus on the highest return investment on the ones that are going to be paying off shorter term rather than long term and making sure that the whole company is mobilizing to continue to do what we currently do, not what we are investing in, but what we currently do much more efficiently and much more productively. So, that’s kind of the balancing act. So, I don’t think that, that’s going to dramatically change given it’s almost like a dual mandate, if you were the Fed, right, growth, employment and inflation is a little bit of that. We have a dual mandate to maintain high levels of short-term profitability versus long-term growth. So, that’s – now, there are outside possibilities that we have discarded. We are not going to run the EBITDA margin significantly higher in the company unless there is a – that’s incredible amount of money that flows through the P&L because of higher equity values in our indexing products. And on the other hand, we are not going to meaningfully lower at all the levels of margins that we currently have. So, that’s the objective that we have so far. Thank you for that question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to piggyback on the last question and just ask you, as you think about areas of investment and areas where you would like to accelerate investment to drive growth longer term, where are you most focused? What type of products, what segments of your business? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: So, there are a number of areas. I mean pretty much everything that we do at MSCI has a tail in this back and long-term – incredible long-term potential. We are very fortunate about that. Now, some things materialize faster in the short-term and some things are going to take a few quarters, maybe a few years to materialize in a big way. The first thing that we always focus on is the continued growth of our index franchis, because despite what some people think about indexation, whether it’s benchmarking, this is all to active managers, active equity managers or the pace of growth of passive investing. We see enormous possibilities of derivative products, both listed, options, futures and structured products with the enormous potential for non-market capital indices in ESG, in thematic, in climate, in factors and all of that. And now we have a new wave of growth coming from direct index in wealth management, which is an ability to basically customize an individual portfolio in a way that is scalable with indices rather than active management. So – and on top of that, that’s the equity part. And on top of that, we see a lot of potential in fixed income indexation. So, this is all part of the barbell in the investment world. On one hand, is high levels of systematic investing in which index investing is part of that and the other part is very high levels of active management, which obviously private asset management is the most important one, but also concentrated portfolios and things like that. So, that’s where we are positioned in the company. So, we start with definitely index. Then we look at the next level, which is sustainability and within sustainability ESG, obviously, but climate, we think ESG will continue to grow. ESG is not a political philosophy, it is not – is the investment risk and investment opportunity. No matter what people say, what people politicizes or whatever is part of the fabric of investing as to how you are going to manage the portfolio with respect to all these factors in addition to financial factors and other market factors. So, that we are in obviously down cycle on that given the political situation in the U.S., given the reset of regulations in Europe, but we are beginning to see significant growth of that in Asia. So that’s a second component. The third component, which we are now positioning ourselves enormously is our ability to be a large provider of transparency and performance and risk tools and benchmark indices and asset allocation, etcetera, in the private assets. The biggest revolution going on in the world right now is private credit. It’s going from balance sheet driven things, on the balance sheet of banks and balance sheet of insurance companies to a fund structure. So, if that revolution in private credit into a fund structure has an investor in it, whether it’s an institutional or wealth management individual investor, they are going to need transparency tools. They are going to have to understand performance and risk and all of that, which will be a lot different than on the balance sheet of a bank or an insurance company, and this is where we come in. Those are three big areas that we are focused on. There are other areas that, obviously, our role in fixed income portfolio management is a big one, our role in providing even more tools to the – on analytics, insights, for example in some portfolios and climate risk within analytics. So, those are basically the broad areas that we are focusing on, on the product side. And of course, all of that has a huge corollary of the areas that we are expanding into the client side beyond active managers. As it was said before, you will hear quite often the balance sheet of bank, the hedge funds, the corporates, the asset owners, and so on and so forth. So, that is an area – those are on the client side, we see enormous growth opportunities in the non-asset management segment. So, that’s a little bit of an overview.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.
Scott Wurtzel: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question here. I just wanted to touch on the basis point fees within the Index segment and kind of seeing that steadily decline over the last few quarters. Are there any mix dynamics there we should be aware of as it relates to the current market environment? And how should we be thinking about that basis point fee going forward? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. So we did see a modest decline in the basis points from the prior quarter from 2.50 basis points down to 2.48 basis points. That was driven almost entirely by mix shift. Most of that resulted from a lower contribution of higher fee international products and a higher contribution to AUM from lower fee products with U.S. exposure. I would say there is nothing new to call out here. There can be some dynamics with AUM levels. And you saw this when AUM levels dropped, there was more stability in the fees. So, there are some fee arrangements we have where the fees do step up at lower AUM levels and vice versa, they step down at higher AUM levels. And so that can be one small factor to point out, but I would say nothing out of the ordinary or nothing new relative to what we have seen in the past. We do expect over time fees to gradually come down, driven by mix shift although we expect the growth in assets and the tremendous opportunity we have across so many different frontiers to more than offset that decline, which is what we have seen and as you can tell by the healthy overall ETF revenue contribution, but also the overall ABF revenue growth. And so I would highlight that within non-ETF passive, the fee dynamics have been much more stable there. And that’s going back to the question about custom indexes in the non-ETF passive category. That is an area where we see tremendous engagement and growth around areas like custom indexes and many times, those can be higher fee type mandates that we see.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.
Craig Huber: Thank you. Can you touch on AI and the benefits that you can see going forward here to benefit your products over time, you could potentially sell at a significantly higher price point? What excites you on that front? And also touch on, if you would, the cost-cutting opportunity going forward on that front? Thank you.
Baer Pettit: Sure. I will make a few observations on that. So, I will start with the first point, which is about efficiencies. So, I think we prefer to see it as efficiencies rather than cost-cutting per se because a lot of our goal is to try to get things done faster and to reinvest a lot of that in these growth opportunities that we are talking about. But we are very focused on that aspect of things across a variety of projects that we have going on. So, in turn, we are also working to apply AI in a variety of product areas. We have some – actually, a launch coming up during the course of this quarter on analytic insights where we, in essence, take an enormous amount of complex data for clients, which they normally would have to parse through in rather in efficient ways and bring the direct insights using AI. So, I think that will just be the beginning of that. We have to really be focused on thinking about this in a competitive environment. And so as we go forward, I think the real benefit of AI for us is that we are a very data-rich environment. And our clients are always trying to get greater insights out of all of those capabilities that we deliver to them. And so in terms of new product development, that’s where we will definitely be keeping you have more news during the rest of this year as we bring out, as I said, both in this quarter and quarters ahead, capabilities about bringing our clients greater insight and faster and differentiated calculations using AI.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch on capital allocation, just given what the stock has been doing over the last year and more recently, I am curious if your views on capital allocation have evolved and how you would prioritize share buybacks versus potential M&A opportunities and other things? Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. So, I would say, generally, our approach to capital allocation has not changed. So, we pay a steady dividend that grows with EPS of the company. And then we look to generate value with excess capital and cash beyond that. And so we are continually looking for opportunities to do that. While we do monitor the market for potentially strategic attractive MP&A, sometimes the best opportunity for us for creating value is investing in MSCI, so buying our stock back. And so we are long-term believers in the company and the future value. And so our approach to share repurchases has not changed, and we will look to use available cash when we see attractive opportunities in the stock.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Russell, I think you are on mute. Your next question comes from the line of Greg Simpson with BNP Paribas.
Greg Simpson: Hi there. I just wanted to check in on private markets. Can you talk about the run rate growth of Burgiss. And if you think the 20% top line growth you talked about for 2024 and beyond still looks on track, or are there any challenges in the sales environment within private markets? Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. So, as Baer alluded to, we saw a 17% run rate growth in private capital solutions. I would say generally, our integration is largely on track from both a go-to-market and a technology and data infrastructure standpoint. We have seen encouraging signs in the areas where we think we can add value. So, we have seen outsized growth in EMEA and getting good traction in Asia. So, areas where I think MSCI can help on the go-to-market. I would say more generally, we continue to be optimistic about the long-term opportunity across private capital solutions and continue to see big long-term opportunities there.
Operator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Henry Fernandez, Chairman and CEO of MSCI.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you for joining us today and for those very insightful questions that you asked. As we have said in the past, our operating structure at MSCI is to continue to be a long-term compounder of our earnings and our share price and our revenues and all of that. And there is absolutely no change in our objectives to achieve that. Despite the operating environment challenges that we have had in the last few quarters, we remain conscious in this secular tailwinds and opportunities that we see ahead and that will continue to power our business. The elevated cancels we experienced in the first quarter were as a result of a concentration of client events that we do not expect to continue at these levels in quarters to come. And as we have said, our level of engagement with clients is on parallel [ph], is at a record high, the level of things that they want us to do, solutions that they want us to come up with is totally unparalleled, and it is increasing pretty much every day, every week, every quarter. And therefore, we are very committed in helping them achieve those objectives, whether it’s capitalizing on opportunities or dealing with problems in their portfolios. Therefore, our all-weather franchise is pretty resilient, and it supports the business through good times and bad times. And we would like to thank you again for joining us this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you in the next few days and weeks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where participants are requested to ask one question at a time then add themselves back to the queue for any additional questions. We will have further instructions for you later on. I would now turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter 2023. This press release, along with an earnings presentation and a brief quarterly update, are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements, which are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the equivalent GAAP measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss operating metrics such as run rate and retention rate. Important information regarding our use of operating metrics such as run rate and retention rate are available in the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. As a final housekeeping item, we wanted to remind our analysts to ask one question at a time during the Q&A portion of our call. We do encourage you to ask more questions by adding yourselves back to the queue. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the fourth quarter, MSCI delivered impressive results to close out the year. On our financial metrics, we achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of nearly 30%, organic revenue growth of 15% and free cash flow growth of 24%. On our operating metrics, we posted organic subscription run rate growth of 10% while completing our 10th consecutive year of double-digit subscription run rate growth in Index at 10.8%. We delivered a retention rate of nearly 94%, including our highest ever full year retention rate in Analytics at 94.4%. Assets under management in equity ETF products linked to MSCI Indices reached an all-time record of $1.47 trillion at year-end. Along with near-record AUM balances of nearly $3.2 trillion in non-listed products linked to MSCI Indices, such as separately managed accounts and other institutional and retail fund wrappers. And we also achieved a record level of nonrecurring sales both for the quarter and for the full year. While 96% of MSCI's revenue are from subscription-based or other recurring revenue sources, we also see strong demand for products that are often sold as nonrecurring, which form about 4% of our revenue. The latter group includes Float Data, a recent product innovation, index licenses for OTC derivatives and structured products, history data products and other unique datasets. These products offer entry points for future subscription sales while deepening client relationships. And they represent an important part of our strategy. Despite the global bull market and the signaling of lower rates by the Fed, our clients remained cautious, which has led to tighter budgets and longer sales cycles. Yet even with those headwinds, we achieved strong fourth quarter results, demonstrating once again that MSCI has an all-weather franchise and a team that can deliver in any environment. On capital allocation, our approach has not changed. We remain committed to making organic investments and bolt-on acquisitions that add value while returning excess capital to our owners in the form of share buybacks and dividend payments. Over the past 11 years, MSCI has repurchased more than 40% of our shares outstanding, worth a combined $5.8 billion at an average price of about $117 per share, creating enormous value for our shareholders. MSCI's client-centricity underlies our consistent execution. 90% of MSCI's run rate in 2023 was comprised of clients purchasing from more than one of our product lines, whether in Index, Analytics, Private Assets or ESG and Climate. More than 60% of MSCI's run rate was comprised of clients purchasing from more than three of our product lines. This underscores the value we provide to many of the world's largest financial institutions and also the unique and vital role of MSCI in the capital markets. The standards we set and the tools we provide helps connect the providers of capital with the users of capital. We want to capitalize on important secular trends that are reshaping the global investment landscape. For example, in the index industry, we see rising demand for customization of portfolios. In response, we have expanded our custom index capabilities while maintaining our strength in traditional market cap businesses. Our client-designed indexing tools on MSCI ONE allow investors to personalize indices for highly specific investment objectives. The secular trend of portfolio customization has also driven demand for specialized analytics tools, especially among wealth managers, who represent one of our fastest-growing segments. Earlier this month, MSCI completed the acquisition of Fabric, a wealth technology platform that provides portfolio design, customization and analytics. Adding their capabilities to our total portfolio toolkit will give us more ways than ever to serve the wealth segment. Speaking of total portfolio solutions, we now have an industry-leading platform, thanks to our acquisition of Burgiss. We also have the world's largest, most comprehensive and highest quality private asset class database, covering $15 trillion in holdings across private equity, real estate, debt, infrastructure and natural resources plus another $45 trillion in real estate transactions and portfolio assets. As private allocations continue to grow, MSCI is well positioned to benefit from it. Our data will help us build standard-setting tools for private assets, including benchmark indices and models for evaluating risk performance and portfolio construction. We can then combine our private and public asset class tools to deliver a total portfolio view of risks and opportunities. All of this will help deepen our relationships with multi-asset class allocators of capital. In a larger sense, it will strengthen our entire ecosystem of product lines and capabilities. One notable example is climate because we build our carbon emissions estimates around granular disclosed data. MSCI already provides climate data on about 73,000 companies and issuers under subsidiaries, including more than 55,000 private companies, along with more than 7,000 private equity and private debt funds. We also provide location data on about 1 million asset locations through MSCI GeoSpatial. We assess physical risk on nearly 80% of those locations, leveraging our Climate Value-at-Risk models. Our client strategy can help us grow MSCI's presence among corporate issuers and their advisers. With our recent acquisition of Trove Research, we are now a leading provider of global intelligence on carbon credit. Trove currently analyzes around 15,000 carbon credit projects around the world and supplies that research to corporates, investors and exchanges. They also provide key climate data on more than 3,000 companies, showing both the quantity and the quality of carbon credits used by those companies and also how these credits are shaping their broader net-zero transition plan. There is simply no credible path to reach net-zero emissions without a significant expansion of the voluntary carbon markets. Looking ahead, we still have a long runway to create compounding shareholder value. As always, MSCI will balance our long-term strategic investments, including bolt-on acquisitions, with our commitment to rigorous financial management and short-term execution. And with that, let me now turn the call over to my partner in this great business, Baer Pettit. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll discuss some of the most notable business needs that we see among market participants around the world, describe how MSCI is addressing those needs and explain what it all means for both our financial performance and our increasingly diverse client base. Perhaps the biggest overarching need is for more customized and personalized investment solutions. Across industries and geographies, investors are searching for highly specialized and scalable outcomes aligned with their unique preferences and considerations. Within the index industry this trend has boosted demand for custom indexes that investors can design to reflect the specific objectives of their unique portfolios, which may include capital, income, tax, risk, climate, sustainability and other considerations. For example, since 2020, around one-third of MSCI benchmarks selected by asset owners for policy or mandate allocations have been custom indexes. In the fourth quarter, we posted 20% run rate growth in custom indexes and special packages. While we were pleased to see our clients have success in gathering allocations linked to MSCI’s custom index. For example, a major global insurance company allocated $8 billion into funds linked to our custom index, and a large asset manager licensed a custom index as the basis for an MSCI climate transition aware, ETF in Europe. Rising demand for customization is especially visible in the Wealth segment, where advisors have to integrate their house view with the preferences of their individual clients. As Henry discussed, our acquisition of Fabric will make it much easier for MSCI to deliver customization at scale for wealth managers. In particular, by combining Fabric’s rules-based portfolio construction tools with MSCI factor models and related solutions, we will greatly enhance our capabilities. The Fabric acquisition will build on the strength of our existing wealth franchise, which now totals $107 million firm-wide and delivered 23% run rate growth in the fourth quarter. Among other Q4 business wins, the wealth arm of a major global asset manager licensed MSCI’s multi-asset class factor models. We’ve seen rising demand for integrated technology platforms to support compliance with increasingly complex regulations, especially in climate and sustainability. In response, MSCI continues to integrate our own content and capabilities on platforms such as MSCI ONE, particularly leveraging our analytics franchise, which remains the backbone of where we host client portfolios, enrich those portfolios with specialized content and apply models to deliver insights and reports. For example, in 2023, we helped our clients generate 130,000 climate and sustainability reports on MSCI ONE using our analytics reporting engines up from 16,000 reports in 2022. In analytics more broadly, we’re benefiting from our ongoing investments to support an open ecosystem integrations and in differentiated content. We achieved our best quarter and full year on record for recurring sales in equity analytics with quarterly and annual sales of approximately $9 million and $30 million, respectively for the first time ever with strength from asset managers, market makers and hedge funds and run rate growing by 11%. In product lines with current cyclical challenges, we still see healthy client appetite for key market data and related solutions, including in real assets. For example, our real estate portfolio services, which include climate insights and income insights, and our Index Intel products, which collectively represent about half of our product line run rate, delivered run rate growth of over 10% in a tough commercial real estate environment. In MSCI Private Capital Solutions, formerly Burgiss, we delivered recurring sales of $6.2 million in the fourth quarter, with ending run rate of $98 million growing in the high teens versus the same period last year. In general, our integration of the Burgiss team continues to accelerate and clients have been enthusiastic about our total portfolio vision for public, private and multi-asset class solutions. Across the board, investors increasingly expect richer, more granular data and faster, deeper insights powered by advanced technology. MSCI is meeting this demand through our ongoing data and technology transformation, which has dramatically expanded our use of artificial intelligence. We group AI initiatives into three categories, providing data at scale, transforming the client experience and driving operational efficiency, which will enable incremental investment capacity for MSCI. We have made tremendous progress in each area. For example, through our partnership with Google Cloud, we have accelerated our document acquisition and classification for ESG by a factor of seven, while tripling the speed of our AI models and more than doubling our maximum calculation capacity for real assets. We want to continue to leverage large language models and open source geospatial data sets to meaningfully scale our physical asset data coverage and quality, which we expect can expand to over 100 million physical asset locations and attributes in the next three years to support our goals of comprehensive and complete data coverage for our clients. MSCI has always been a company that plans for extended time horizons. We’re constantly trying to anticipate, capture and commercialize the next evolution of global investing, yet we also work tirelessly to deliver consistent results from quarter-to-quarter, which means we are laser focused on how to create value for clients right now. We will continue striking that balance in 2024 and beyond. And with that, let me turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer and hi, everyone. As you can see from our results, we have a highly resilient business that continues to generate consistently strong performance across product areas and client segments, despite cyclical pressures. In index, we had nearly 11% subscription run rate growth, including 9% run rate growth in our market cap-weighted modules and 20% growth in custom indexes and special packages. Factor and ESG modules grew 11%, a slower rate than last year as clients are favoring more customized approaches and we saw fewer clients launching new active factor strategies. We have a demonstrated track record of growing with our existing client base in index, helping them unlock value through a wide range of use cases across a broad range of content. Half of our index client base subscribes to at least two or more modules, with 20% of clients licensing as many as five or more different modules. Our growing set of modules across market cap, factor, ESG, climate, thematic, fixed income and custom dimensions enable us to continue to bring additional value to our clients and we maintain solid momentum and asset-based fees with revenues up 16% year-over-year, benefiting from over $48 billion of cash inflows and about $198 billion of market appreciation throughout 2023 within ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes. During Q4 cash inflows of $16 billion into equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes were mostly driven by developed markets ex-U.S. and emerging markets products. From a product perspective, we saw inflows of about $6 billion into equity ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and climate indexes, which represented the majority of industry flows into ESG and climate products. Within fixed income ETFs, AUM and products linked to MSCI and Bloomberg joint fixed income indexes reached $60 billion, growing more than 30% year-over-year. We had another very strong quarter for non-recurring revenues. Roughly $16 million of the non-recurring sales and revenues in index were related to client fees for unlicensed usage of our content in historical periods. We also earned non-recurring revenues from other common use cases, including licenses to create structured products and OTC derivatives and index history sales, where a client requires decades of historical data to backtest strategies and conduct research. In analytics, we saw continued momentum across key areas with subscription run rate growth of 7% supported by strong net new recurring sales growth of 68%. Analytics revenue also benefited from a large number of implementations that were completed in the quarter, which resulted in both elevated non-recurring revenue and the release of recurring subscription revenue that was on hold during the respective implementation periods. In our ESG and Climate Reportable segment, organic run rate growth was 16%, which excludes about $4.5 million of run rate from Trove and the impact of FX. Run rate growth was approximately 15% in ESG research and 31% in climate, excluding the impact of Trove and run rate growth was 25% within Europe and close to 20% in Asia for our ESG and Climate segment. We continue to see strong engagement across client types, with a retention rate of 94.7% for the quarter and 95.9% for the full year, although we did see an increase in cancels from smaller clients in large part related to an elevated level of client events. Within real assets run rate growth was 6% as we continue to see the impact of muted property values and lower transaction volumes. The retention rate of 89% for the quarter was impacted by pickup and cancels from small clients, namely brokers, developers and lenders, who are most acutely feeling these cyclical pressures, although, once again our larger clients tended to have higher retention rates. Almost 80% of clients that subscribed to our RCA product offerings spent over $50,000 per year on average and the retention rate of that cohort is 96% for the full year of 2023. Also, it is worth highlighting that about 95% of client contracts for RCA products have an auto renew provision or multiyear contracts. Our integration of Burgiss, which we now refer to as our Private Capital Solutions operating segment, is going well. We recorded approximately $25 million of revenue for the quarter, which came in at the high end of our initial expectations, although we did benefit from revenue catch-ups resulting from the completion of implementations on our total plan product offering. Private Capital Solutions expenses included about $4 million of allocations from centralized and shared costs. We continue to expect about $4 million to $5 million per quarter of these allocations to the segment. These costs are reallocated from other segments and as a result will not impact firm-wide EBITDA. Our approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. We will continue to invest in the business to drive strong top line growth over the long-term, while continuing to deliver attractive free cash flow and EPS growth. We will continue to optimize our capital structure, return excess cash to shareholders through regular dividends that grow with adjusted EPS and opportunistically pursue share buybacks and value generative bolt-on M&A that accelerates our strategy in key growth areas. In the spirit of continually optimizing our capital structure, last week we completed the refinancing of our credit where we replaced our term loan A and existing revolver with a new revolver that provides us with more capacity at $1.25 billion in total size, slightly lower costs than the now retired term loan a and an extended tenor, and our capital position remains solid overall. As of today, we currently have approximately $600 million of cash on hand, well above our minimum global cash balance range. Although cash balances are still down from last year's levels, which will continue to translate through to lower interest income. Lastly, we continue to execute bolt-on acquisitions that accelerate our long-term strategy. Total purchase consideration for Trove and Fabric was approximately $48 million with the potential for additional performance-related payments tied to the achievement of top-line growth targets, although the majority of those payments will be treated as compensation expense. Turning to our 2024 guidance, which we published earlier this morning. Our guidance assumes that AUM levels remain relatively flat to year-end levels through the first half of 2024 with a modest upturn in the second half of the year. Our expenses reflect the ongoing investments in our business as well as the impact of our acquisitions of Burgiss, Trove and Fabric. Our CapEx guidance reflects continued software development to build or enhance our offerings across all of our segments, including Private Capital Solutions as well as slightly higher hardware purchases related to our hybrid data center strategy. Our interest expense guidance reflects the refinancing of our credit facilities and assumes the existing balance of approximately $340 million remains outstanding for the year. Our tax rate guidance reflects the impact of the OECD global minimum tax, which goes into effect this year, statutory rate increases we are subject to in certain jurisdictions and a slightly smaller projected impact from windfall benefits. I would like to highlight that our effective rate in the fourth quarter included a discrete benefit related to a favorable outcome on a tax position received late in the quarter. And lastly, free cash flow guidance reflects the expectation of slightly higher cash taxes. Overall, we remain well positioned to drive growth. Our client-centricity and multiyear investments position us for strength to start 2024, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you so much. I was hoping you could give some additional color on the market environment, maybe particularly with regard to Index. I know you’ve called out some market headwinds recently. And so just looking into 2024, do you see those persisting? And how should we think about new sales within Index for next year? Thank you so much.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Toni, it’s Andy. Appreciate the question. So yes, I mean, we are seeing a tough environment for many of our clients. As we’ve talked about before, our largest client base is active managers that have seen flat markets for the last couple of years. We’re encouraged by the recent rally, and that should be helpful over the long term. But they have seen relatively flat markets volatility and outflows. So, we have seen headwinds, but we continue to have good momentum. And I think the thing that’s been encouraging to us is the success we’ve had across modules and client segments. And so we mentioned some of these, but just to highlight, we saw 9% run rate growth in our market cap modules. And that’s through delivering additional value to our clients, continuing to upsell them. We saw 20% growth in custom and specialized modules, an 11% growth in factor and ESG modules. Equally as encouraging, we saw 9% growth in asset managers, 15% growth from wealth and broker-dealers and 22% growth among hedge funds. So, we’ve definitely been encouraged here. I think we will see longer sales cycles, tighter budgets here. Budgets for the year are set at the end of the prior year for many organizations, and so that will create some noise for us. But this trend of indexation and the demand for the tools that we have across many different client segments seems to have some momentum here. So, we’ll continue to monitor closely. But importantly, we continue to focus on creating value for our clients, and that will hopefully translate through to continued success on sales and growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes, hello, everyone. Interesting to hear you talk a little bit less than usual about ESG and Climate. So clearly, I need to ask about it. So, we obviously have continued to see slowdown in that segment after a couple of years of really, really big strength. So, I guess, now with that slowdown in the run rate now, I’m just wondering if there’s any signs that things could be turning maybe as Climate is becoming a bigger part of the equation or, again, as investors are we thinking kind of like what they need, in particular outside of the U.S. So any near-term expectations there? And how is that impacting your longer-term outlook as well? Because obviously, these run rates are far below your mid to high-20s longer-term range. So just curious how you’re thinking about that at the moment. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, sure. Thanks, Alex. So, I’d say the most encouraging thing for us has been the strong level of engagement we’re seeing from our clients around ESG and very significantly around Climate. So despite the slowdown, we are still seeing a healthy level of dialogue with our clients on this front. Consistent with what we’ve seen in recent quarters and throughout 2023, as you alluded to growth has been slower for us. Just to put a finer point on that, in the ESG and Climate segment, growth in the Americas was about 9%. That compares to 25% in Europe and close to 20% in Asia. I’d say the themes are consistent, where clients are taking a more measured approach to how they integrate ESG. They’re continuing to think about how and where they integrate it, and that’s causing longer sales cycles and more deliberate purchasing decisions, which is probably compounded by, I think, cyclical pressures that are hitting many of our clients. But given the wide range of use cases, I think we continue to be quite encouraged about the outlook here. We see regulation will create some delays in purchases, continues to be a big opportunity for us. As you alluded to, Climate continues to be a big opportunity for us. And we continue to innovate heavily across Climate with plans to release things like nature and biodiversity data sets, additional insights into private assets, geospatial data, which Baer alluded to, physical and hazard risk enhancements. And that’s on top of continuing to broaden our coverage across ESG, enhance the quality of our offering and our service. And so I think we’ve got a rich pipeline of opportunities and solutions where we can continue to deliver value to clients. But I think we would expect some of these dynamics that we’re seeing the more measured purchasing decisions and some of the cyclical pressures probably to persist for at least next couple of quarters here.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Maybe we’ll just go down the segments here. Can we just talk about the Analytics business? Obviously, it sounds like things have gotten bad there through the year. It sounds like it’s the equity asset class. But just is there – are you just – is there some share gains? Is it just an uptake in the models? Like maybe just some of the trends that you’re seeing there perhaps that can help you sustain this high single-digit rate?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. So there are a number of trends at play here, but maybe I can group them together and say, this heightened period of uncertainty and risk has led to opportunities for us. And so clients are turning to us across many of our different solutions to help understand market drivers and risks and how to navigate those risks. And I think it’s been very encouraging to see the highest-ever full year retention rate we’ve seen within the segment, which I think underscores the power of that need for our tools in this market. Just to put a finer point on where we’re seeing that, we did see some strong successes within ERP in the quarter. our Enterprise Risk and Performance offering, which has been supported by things like liquidity analytics and demands for deeper insights into liquidity risk. We’ve also had some traction with the partnerships that we’ve alluded to in the past, and we have gotten favorable feedback by enhancing user experiences. As we’ve talked about in the last couple of quarters, we had another strong quarter and a strong year across our factor models as well. So, we did see pretty good momentum on Equity Analytics, particularly with our factor model sales. And we have had – it’s early days, but we’ve had some traction with our risk insights offering as well, which is a new offering for us, where we’re providing clients with more easily accessible, more interactive and more user-friendly risk and performance stats on their portfolios. So, we’re encouraged. The growth we’re seeing is an area that we’ve been focused and investing and so we definitely are encouraged by the outlook. But I would say, particularly given the backdrop and the fact that within Analytics, we do have a higher concentration of broker-dealers and hedge funds, we do expect to see some lumpiness in both sales and cancels moving forward here. But the long-term dynamics in those areas of traction we’ve been getting have been quite encouraging to us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Hess with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Alexander Hess: Hi guys. Baer, you alluded to a desire to meaningfully scale the physical asset business. Just wanted – it sounds like you guys have fleshed out a bit more sort of a concrete near-term road map for the ESG and Climate business. But sort of can you maybe dimensionalize why you guys weren’t in that earlier? Is that something where you feel the competitors maybe have a head start? And then beyond that, is there – how would you monetize this? Is that going to be more of a consumption-based model? Or is that going to be on sort of a subscription program as well? Thank you guys.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So look, the Climate opportunity is an enormous one, which will affect all aspects of the economy and industries, right? So, I think it’s natural that there will be aspects of it which at the outset we were not present in and where we’re broadening and deepening our capabilities, right? So I think that's a general observation which could be both from our actions organically and inorganic. So in this instance, we're very excited with what we've done here, not merely because there's clearly demand from this, but it's also an area where we're able to apply a lot of interesting work in data science and AI. So there's client demand, it plays to our strengths in this growth category, and I think we've got a really good chance of continuing to innovate. Just in terms of the business model, it's the same as usual, right? So it's a subscription business model. It's integrated with the normal way that we sell and it's just enriching our capabilities across the board.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Owen Lau: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So your non-recurring revenue was up quite a bit in both Index and Analytics. And I think you recognize some fees for unlicensed usage of the content, like in the past, in slower periods in the Index business. I think for Analytics you had some large number of implementation and some on-time [ph] deals. Could you please elaborate a little bit more on what they actually are and what that means for recurring revenue going forward? Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, sure. Owen, thank you. So maybe I'll start on Index and then I can touch on Analytics. But yes, I think it's helpful to give a bit more color on exactly what these non-recurring sales and revenues are. So as we mentioned, during the quarter, we had a very large contract signed to address the unlicensed usage of our Indexes in past periods. And just to put a finer point on that, just to be very clear, we identified a client that had been using our Indexes to create Index Linked products without a license over a long time period. And so during the quarter, we signed an agreement that we would be paid for that passed on license usage. And as a result recorded a sale and revenue associated with that. It is worth noting that we continue to see contributions to non-recurring sales and revenue from the licensing of our Indexes to create things like structured products and over-the-counter derivatives. We also have non-recurring sales of – and uses of our – some of our data packages, like our free float data package and our Index history sales. And so those unlicensed usage sales are by their nature going to be lumpy and we don't have those very often, as you know. But these other trends in things like over-the-counter derivatives and structured products are areas where we do see some momentum and should continue to be a contributor for us, but no changes to our business model overall, other than to say we see growth opportunities across categories of non-recurring revenue and sales for us. As you alluded to on the Analytics side, we did have a number of implementation related services that were completed during the quarter and so those implementation related services are non-recurring in nature. And so we recognize non-recurring revenue when we complete those. It is worth noting on the recurring side as well for certain products that involve implementations such as our enterprise risk solutions. We defer the revenue until the implementation is complete, at which point we recognize the revenue from the beginning of the contract period to that point. And so we will have what we call these catch ups when we have implementations coming online, and we had several of those during the quarter. I'd say within Analytics, the non-recurring revenue tends to be most closely tied to those implementations and so it generally will be tied to the business growth over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Seth Weber: Hey guys. Good morning. Wanted to ask about traction with the Burgiss integration. I think I heard something about run rate in the high teens, which sounds pretty encouraging. And I think on prior calls we've talked about how the product line is pretty undersold globally and just wondering how the integration or how the combination is going with Burgiss salespeople, working with existing MSCI salespeople just to kind of start cross selling the product? Thank you.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So happy to take that question. We're very pleased with how the integration is going. I think there was clearly a benefit that we were a minority shareholder of Burgiss for a number of years, so got to know the business very well. We had one of our senior executives, Jay McNamara, there working for a number of years and really helped to revitalize their client activity and go-to-market and all the commercial side. So he is now a Co-Head of the business with Charissa Smith. So I think both from an operational point of view, we're very pleased with the integration and we've got a team of client coverage people there that were already, if you like, trained the MSCI way under Jay, and the – and now those teams can work seamlessly with the MSCI client coverage team. So we're delighted with the way things have gone so far and I think we've got a big opportunity globally to expand significantly the footprint in private capital solutions. So, so far so good. Good end to the year and we hope to keep delivering some strong numbers during the course of 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Kelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On your expenses guidance, I was just wondering if you can walk us through kind of the puts and takes of that expense guidance range? What would take it to the higher end versus the lower end of that guidance? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. So, listen, on expenses, it's a similar story to what we give every year. I think we outlined in the prepared remarks here that the AUM assumption that underlies the expense guidance assumes that the markets remain relatively flat for the first half of the year and then rebound slightly in the back half of the year. As we always do we will continue to monitor the market and we'll continue to monitor business performance. And so we will go to our upturn and downturn playbooks throughout the year if we do see sustained improvements, which could cause us to move towards the higher end of that range, or similarly cause us to manage expenses more tightly if things deteriorate. As you know, and I think is evident, there is a meaningful contribution from acquisitions as well in the expense guidance for the year. I think we've given color on the Burgiss margin profile and I think we indicated Trove and Fabric are relatively small in terms of their impact. But from that you can back into the organic expense growth being in, call it the mid to high single digit range embedded in that guidance, and the balance being contributed from mainly Burgiss, but to a lesser degree the smaller acquisitions coming in. The last thing that's probably worth lagging, and we've mentioned this in past years, is we have seasonally high payroll tax and benefits related expenses in the first quarter. And so we tend to see about $10 million to $15 million higher of those expenses coming through, which adds to some seasonality and higher expenses in Q1. But other than that, I'd say it's something that we continue to monitor and our goal ultimately is to continue to invest in the business to drive long-term growth and we'll use opportunities if the market improves here to continue to do that, but also continuing to deliver attractive profitability and profitability growth in all periods and attractive free cash flow growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. A quick question on the pricing actions that you might have instituted in 2024, and how should we think about the pricing tailwinds in Index and overall business for 2024? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, sure. So listen, it's important to underscore that we will continue to be very measured on our price increases and ensure that we are linking them to the value that we are delivering to our clients in terms of enhanced solutions, enhanced services and broader usage of our tools. As we mentioned in prior quarters, during 2023, price increases were higher than they've been in recent years and contributed a larger percentage of new recurring sales relative to recent years. I would say in Index that contribution is similar where the contribution from price increases within Index was above 40% for the year, which I think is consistent with what we've mentioned before. And it's important to underscore that there are numerous factors that feed into our price increases, including most notably, the value that we're delivering to clients. But the broader environment and client health are all things we think about. And so to the extent that inflation continues to moderate. We will likely moderate price increases in certain areas, all else equal. But we'll continue to monitor all those factors, including the enhancements in value that we deliver to clients and calibrate price increases accordingly going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: All right. Thanks. Good morning. Going back to the topic of ESG, you mentioned regulations are causing some delays in client purchases. Can you elaborate on which regulations you're watching as well as how different outcomes of the U.S. election cycle could potentially impact ESG demand?
Baer Pettit: Sure. So I think there has been a component of the changes in the regulation in Europe delaying product issuance. But there's also a broader context that the regulatory framework in Europe, in the EU, is driving a lot of growth as well. And you can see that in the numbers that we've mentioned. So I think that overall, the regulatory topic related to ESG and climate has definitely become a positive for us in balance. Look, I don't – it's not our role to speculate on U.S. politics and outcomes. My only observation would be that when we look notably at a lot of the major asset owners in the U.S., their approach to this topic has not changed and it remains central for them. I think there may be a question as to when product issuance will pick up again in the U.S., and time will tell. But we're also seeing a significant increase in Asia [ph] of interest. So on balance, the landscape remains one with some significant opportunities, some areas a little bit slower, but we're just doing our business of interacting with clients every day and impressing them the value of our services. And then politics will be what politics is.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on the expense question. And I wonder if you could talk about some of the puts and takes around investments, because it seems that you've sort of been executing on more of a downturn playbook over the last couple of years. And I'm curious how much runway you think you have around expense savings. Are there areas where you’d like to invest more? Sort of how should we think about your approach towards investments?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, yes. So it’s an area that we spend a huge amount of time on. And we are continually focused on driving efficiencies, enhancing productivity across organizations so that we can invest more in the business. And even though it’s been a tougher environment, we’ve been able to continue to enhance and increase the amount of money we put into investment areas. To your point, we would love to invest more. We have very attractive opportunities across all the areas we’ve talked about in terms of new solutions, new client segments, technology-enabled capabilities. Those are all areas that we have the upturn ready to go. But we will be measured and ensure that we see sustained improvements in the market and business performance before we take up the level of investment materially. But it’s something that we are laser-focused on and want to continue to maintain our Triple-Crown discipline and ensure that we are putting those investment dollars into those areas that are going to generate attractive near-term returns for us. And so it’s something that we are on top of and continually monitoring. And that’s something that, to the extent the market performance and business performance fluctuates, we’ll look for opportunities to put more investment to work.
Henry Fernandez: Let me add a comment to what Andy said. The long term – given the significant and incredible opportunity that we face at MSCI in all of our product lines from customization in index and direct indexing, to climate risk and climate opportunities, to ESG, to Private Assets, and of course, the significant uptick that we’ve seen in Analytics, the long-term value creation of MSCI will depend a great deal on incremental investment in all these growth areas. You can’t grow without creating new products, creating new services, creating innovation, reaching out to new client segments like wealth, like insurance, like corporates, like GPs and private assets, et cetera. So our overriding amount of time that Andy alluded to is spent on this area is to balance out the profitability of the business and the margin of the business with incremental investment. And the lever that we’ve been pulling significantly is creating more and more efficiency, tightening up what we do with higher productivity, locating more and more of our staff to emerging market centers and the like. And that has allowed us to, as Andy said, increase the amount of investment that we can deploy in the business. We are extremely excited about AI and the utilization of AI to allow for an even larger amount of efficiencies, a lot of productivity in which we can free up more resources and again put it back into the investment of the business in all the growth areas that we’ve identified.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Heather Balsky: Hi, good morning. Well, I guess it’s almost good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a little bit about Index and market share. We get incoming questions from investors asking about where you guys fit in, in terms of the broader market. And I’m curious, from your perspective, what are – where do you see the wallet share opportunities? And then what are you monitoring in terms of some of your competitors gaining share? Thanks so much. 
Baer Pettit: Yes. Thanks for the question. Well, look, we clearly have pretty transparent statistics on that in the ETF market, which we discussed, and those have been fairly stable. It’s quite difficult to judge this in a lot of the subscription market. There’s not really transparent data that shows us exactly what’s happening. So the key thing that we try to focus on is ensuring that we are continuing to maintain our growth rates in some of our key segments, as you can see from the numbers that we put out quarter-after-quarter, but more importantly, is trying to be innovative about some of the opportunities that have been central to our growth that have been a big theme throughout our comments today. The customization area is dramatic in all client types, and we’re investing in that both organically and through these – some of these acquisitions that we’re looking at, even if they’re bolt-on ones. So I think as we get – our big driver is to be innovative in new segments with customization. And if we do that, I think we can continue to have the leading position in the industry that we have. And then I think the other one that I would say is a key focus is global geographic diversification. This is an enormous strength of our franchise, and we’ve seen that in the numbers. As we continue to grow in all geographies in Index, notwithstanding the fact that in many of those geographies over the last number of quarters, equity markets have been in the doldrums more than they’ve been in the U.S. But we still continue to put in strong performances in subscription growth. So I think overall, we kind of look at how we’re innovating. We – I could say things anecdotally about competition, but I don’t think they’re going to be helpful. So it’s mostly focusing on what we do well and serving clients and innovating. And if we keep doing that, I’m confident that we can maintain our growth trajectory.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead. 
Craig Huber: Great. Thank you. I wanted to hear your thoughts on your sales force. Your sales force has obviously been very effective, very efficient over many, many years. You guys highlighted part of that today with all the cross-selling that they’ve been doing and stuff. And I’m just curious, your plans for internal investment spending this year, does it include any extra spending level that you – above and beyond what you normally would do on the sales force throughout your organization for this upcoming year? I’m just trying to get a sense on that because it seems like a pretty good opportunity you guys to lean further into that. I’m just curious what your thought is on that. Thank you. 
Baer Pettit: Look, it’s a great question. So as you know, Henry is our lead salesman now. And he spends an enormous amount of his time with clients, which has had a huge impact in our senior relationships. I am myself a retired Global Head of Client Coverage to MSCI. And our current Global Head of Client Coverage, Alvise Munari, is doing a great job. And so I think it’s both a question of scale and reach, which we really focused on, but it’s also really important to be creative and innovative. And as we look across a given order, like the one we have today, the diversity of transactions, of different client types, different geographies, different use cases, all of that comes from our client coverage organization, really having that DNA of finding out new use cases, new opportunities, which I think is really central to how we operate. So – and then for sure, we will continue to invest in our client coverage organization, in salespeople, in consultants and client service. Now we’re also very focused on the productivity of the organization, and that’s a key component to ensuring we continue to invest. But this is really – when we think of investments, we definitely think of our client organization and its reach and scale as being central to our future trajectory. So happy to take a longer discussion off-line, but it’s absolutely central to what we think is a great strength of MSCI.
Henry Fernandez: Let me add something else here that the area – MSCI has progressed significantly in many, many areas. The one area that I feel the most proud of – or proudest, I guess, of is the incredible level of reach and dialogue that we have with clients all over the world. It’s not only at the user level. Traditionally, in the past, MSCI is sold by a subject matter expert to – of MSCI selling directly into a user at the client organization. What we now have done in addition to that is build very deep and very wide relationship with the CEOs and the CIOs and all that because we’re conscious that we’re increasing our wallet share or mind share with a lot of these clients. And we need a lot of support from the top-down in understanding what we’re doing and how we can add value and partner up with our client organizations. The client coverage organization, Alvise Munari is I think 1,200 professionals by now, so significant expansion because of some of the acquisitions that we have made, which have added a lot of salespeople. And the key focus there is industrial scale, is trying to figure out how to continue to grow that client coverage organization in a manner that it is tightening up the organizational structure, the organizational design, the roles, the responsibilities. We’re putting a lot of technology and a lot of data in understanding how the – what the clients buying, how are they buying, managing the pipeline and so on and so forth. So I think we have a lot of runway to benefit from in reaching out to more clients. This is going to become especially important because we’re scaling up significantly to new areas. Wealth management, it’s a lot of wealth management organizations around the world. Corporates, there are thousands and thousands of corporate entities around the world, right? Insurance companies, the general partners of equity – private equity firm, private credit firm, private infrastructure, private debt firms and the like. So really, really exciting, a lot of what we’re doing.
Operator: There are no further questions. At this time, I’d like to turn the floor back to Henry Fernandez for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: So thank you, everyone for joining us today. Our fourth quarter and full year performance, as you can see, was a direct result of our focus on clients and pricing [ph] and our all-weather franchise. We remain very excited about the tremendous opportunities that we have in front of us and the investments that we’re making to capitalize on them. And we will execute flawlessly on that growth agenda. One of – I think that it’s always more to keep an company. We welcome anybody who wants to have a dialogue with us at any point at any time. And we will be more than happy to answer your questions or any other questions that people may have. Thank you again and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today’s call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen -only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question at a time. We will have further instructions for you later on. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter 2023. This press release, along with an earnings presentation and a brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements, which are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of US GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the equivalent GAAP measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss operating metrics such as run rate and retention rate. Important information regarding our use of operating metrics such as run rate and retention rates are available in the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, MSCI delivered impressive results in an uncertain environment. Among other highlights, we achieved adjusted EPS growth of over 21%, total revenue growth of 12%, recurring subscription run rate growth of 12% and a retention rate of 95.4%. Amid turmoil in global markets, rising geopolitical tensions and a challenging operating environment are highly diversified by all weather franchise continues to drive strong financial performance. We recognize that in this uncertain environment, our capital allocation decisions are more important than ever. In the first nine months of this year, we returned $459 million to the owners of MSCI in the form of share repurchases and more than $329 million in the form of dividends. This signals our confidence in MSCI's long-term prospects and our commitment to be a compounder for shareholders. We're also committed to prioritizing high growth and high potential investments while maintaining high levels of profitability. We recently capitalized on two opportunistic strategic acquisitions. With the completed acquisition of Burgiss, MSCI can now provide additional clarity and transparency, highly needed by investors across private and public assets in their portfolios. Over the past 36 years, Burgiss has created greater private asset transparency while serving institutional investors such as special funds, endowments, foundations and family offices. Combined with our private real estate franchise, MSCI now has the world's largest highest quality private asset class database, covering more than $60 trillion of assets. We believe, we now have a unique and a strong foundation of data and analytics to build standards such as benchmark indices, performance, risk, liquidity, pricing and asset allocation models and other tools. In effect, our goal is to develop the MSCI of private assets. As for MSCI's announced acquisition of Trove Research, Trove is a world-renowned source of intelligence on the voluntary carbon market. We believe this market will play a significant role in helping institutional investors and companies reduce climate risk. All markets drive on reliable, uniform standards and robust transparency. As the world pushes for net zero emissions, investors need to understand whether companies are making real progress and how they are using carbon credits. Likewise, companies need to understand the value of the credits they are buying and selling. By integrating the data, analytics and capabilities of Trove with our own comprehensive climate solutions, MSCI will have a robust suite of tools to promote clarity and consistency in the voluntary carbon market. Both of these acquisitions, Burgiss and Trove, advanced MSCI's larger business strategy and mission of providing tools for the investment world to systemically understand and measure performance and risk, which leads to more optimal asset allocation and portfolio construction. We aim to capture major trends across the investment landscape, including the continued allocations to private assets and the growing incorporation of climate as a material driver in the repricing of securities and the reallocation of capital. Our product lines are increasingly interconnected, which means our work in private assets reinforces our work in climate and vice versa. For example, together with Burgiss, we previously developed a tool that offers climate data on around 50,000 private companies and more than 6,000 private equity and private debt funds. In summary, MSCI continues to benefit from our resilient business model underpinned by rigorous financial management and a strong secular tailwinds. From our recurring revenue business model to our mission critical solutions, we believe MSCI remains well-positioned in any operating environment. And with that, let me turn the call over to Baer.
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll build on what Henry said about Burgiss, discuss our third quarter results by product line and highlight our regional performance in Asia Pacific. Our acquisition of Burgiss, which we completed earlier this month, position MSCI to serve investors and managers across all asset classes with a world-class platform for delivering total portfolio investment solutions and one of the industry's largest private asset databases covering more than 13,000 bonds. As Henry mentioned, Burgiss deepens our existing presence with pension funds and sovereign wealth funds while helping MSCI expand our presence among client segments, such as endowments, foundations and family offices. We are well underway with integrating the 650-plus Burgiss employees and the roughly 1,000 Burgiss clients into our operations, and we look forward to providing updates on our progress. Turning to our Q3 results. MSCI achieved another solid quarter of performance across client segments and product lines. At the client level, we delivered subscription run rate growth of 15% collectively among wealth managers, banks and broker-dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and corporates. And for our largest client base, we delivered around 10% growth amongst asset owners and asset managers combined. As those numbers indicate, we have maintained our strength and momentum across all client segments. Looking at our product lines. In index, we posted our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit subscription run rate growth of 11%. Meanwhile, total direct indexing AUM based on MSCI indexes increased by 68% to $95 billion. We also saw increased index licensing from hedge fund clients, where new recurring subscription sales more than doubled, reflecting growth from both market cap-weighted modules and our float data. In addition, MSCI won a big strategic mandate to build client design indexes for one of America's largest wealth managers. This demonstrates how we continue to capitalize on rising demand for tools to support portfolio customization at scale, a trend that is especially visible in the wealth segment. Turning to analytics. We delivered subscription run rate growth of 7%, resulting in over $639 million of run rate and a near record retention rate of 95.1%. Globally, we posted recurring sales growth of 30% in enterprise risk and performance driven by a significant number of large deals with asset managers and asset owners. For example, MSCI completed one of our largest ever liquidity analytics deals covering both regulatory reporting requirements and liquidity risk management. Despite pressures on equity managers, we also grew equity analytics by 11% to nearly $200 million in run rate. In ESG, we delivered 21% run rate growth across our product lines for, taking our run rate to $387 million, while posting a retention rate of 96%. At the regional level, the regulatory environment continues to ADSG sales in EMEA, and our solutions continue helping clients navigate new requirements. In Climate, we achieved 49% run rate growth across our product lines from Y, where we now have $98 million of run rate including $68 million of subscription run rate growing by 49%, which had a retention rate of 97%. In addition, AUM and MSCI index-linked climate ETFs increased by 64% to $71 million while MSCI index-linked climate equity non-ETF AUM increased by 75% to $107 billion. Finally, in real assets, we posted total run rate growth of almost 10%, along with a retention rate of 91%. Geographically, our Q3 results were especially strong in APAC, where MSCI continues to benefit from the increasing scale and growing breadth of the investment industry and the reach. For example, in real assets, APAC achieved 15% run rate growth and grow strong sales with asset owners, including for our real estate index Intel and Performance Insights tool. In Index, APAC delivered recurring subscription run rate growth of almost 15%, bringing our footprint to approximately $178 million. MSCI's underlying strength of the company reflects our increasingly diverse range of capabilities and clients across geographies. Those advantages become even more important during periods of market volatility and uncertainty. As a result, we continue to see high levels of client engagement across segments, products and regions. And we also see healthy pipeline as we approach the end of the year. Looking ahead, MSCI will remain laser focused on strong profitability, while continuing to invest in our business. And with that, let me turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andrew Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hi, everyone. Our attractive financial model enabled us to deliver double-digit growth in the quarter across revenue, recurring subscription run rate and adjusted EPS. In Index subscription, we drove 9% run rate growth in our market cap weighted modules, high-teens growth in custom indexes and mid-teens growth in our ESG and factor modules. We saw strong subscription run rate growth from hedge funds, wealth managers and broker-dealers of 26%, 19% and 15%, respectively, all of which continue to support steady double-digit index subscription run rate growth. Asset-based fee revenues were up more than 12% year-over-year, benefiting from $55 billion of cash inflows and $186 billion of market appreciation over the last 12 months within equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. During the third quarter, cash inflows into ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes were driven also entirely by ETFs with US and other developed market exposures. These cash inflows were supported by roughly $3 billion of flows into equity ETFs linked to our ESG and Climate indexes. And we continue to gain traction in fixed income with AUM and ETFs linked to MSCI and Bloomberg joint fixed income indexes reaching nearly $52 billion, growing more than 40% year-over-year. In analytics, subscription run rate growth was 7%, with continued strength in our factor models and our risk tools more broadly. Our investments in enhancing our content, our capabilities and the client experience, including through Climate Lab Enterprise insights and ESG and climate reporting services are driving new commercial opportunities across analytics. In our ESG and Climate reportable segment, the run rate growth was 25%, with 21% growth in ESG research and 44% growth in Climate. Relative to a year-ago, we saw lower new recurring sales in the Americas, which continue to reflect more measured purchasing decisions among US investors. However, new recurring sales in both Europe and APAC were essentially unchanged year-over-year. The retention rate in ESG and Climate segment remained healthy at 96%, although we did see slightly higher cancels resulting from client events at smaller institutions. Within Real Assets, run rate growth was 10%. We see momentum in our real estate index intel and portfolio offerings. Although, we continue to see the impact of industry pressures on our transaction data, most notably in client segments such as real estate brokers and lenders. While we expect the pressures to continue, we are encouraged by the long-term opportunity and the momentum we see in many of the market data, climate and portfolio offerings we are providing. We are also expanding our commercial real estate transaction database to include deals below $2.5 million and our data universe to include properties that have never transacted. As a reminder, beginning in the fourth quarter, we will report financial results for Burgiss in our all other private assets segment. To provide an update on the financial impact of Burgiss, we expect Burgiss to generate slightly above $90 million of rev for full year 2023, with revenues of $22 million to $24 million expected in the fourth quarter. The standalone Burgiss adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be around 15% for full year 2023. However, we currently expect about $4 million to $5 million per quarter of allocations to Burgiss from centralized and shared costs on top of the standalone adjusted EBITDA. It is worth noting that these allocations are reallocated from other segments and will not impact firm-wide EBITDA. Given these allocations, we expect contributions from Burgiss to the adjusted EBITDA for all other segment to be minimal in Q4, although we expect some margin expansion from Burgiss next year. Meanwhile, as we've done in previous acquisitions, we will exclude certain integration-related expenses from our adjusted non-GAAP figures. More broadly on the capital allocation front, we continue to be opportunistic and capitalize on attractive opportunities as highlighted by our announced acquisition of Trove. We expect Trove, which has a few million dollars of run rate and which will be included in our ESG and Climate segment to be immaterial to our results in the near term. Turning to our guidance. I would highlight that our ranges incorporate the impact of Burgiss and assume that AUM levels remain relatively stable through the balance of the year. Expense ranges now reflect both the slightly elevated pace of spend as well as a full quarter of expenses from Burgiss, including a small amount of integration expenses that will not be from adjusted metrics. Our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged. Although we have slightly increased our CapEx guidance which continues to reflect a higher level of software capitalization and some elevated hardware purchases related to our hybrid infrastructure approach, which includes maintaining a presence in select on-prem data centers is to leveraging our public cloud partnerships. Our D&A guidance captures the additional intangible from purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions. We've slightly lowered and narrowed our effective tax rate guidance, reflecting the impact of a nontaxable gain on our investment in Burgiss of approximately $140 million in the fourth quarter, which will be excluded from our adjusted metrics. Excluding the impact of this onetime item, we would expect an adjusted tax rate range for the full year that is about 1% higher than the effective tax rate range or 17.5% to 19%. Lastly, our interest expense guidance reflects our intention to draw a small amount on the revolver to provide some additional liquidity. Additionally, I would highlight that we expect lower interest income on our cash balances as a result of funding Burgiss. As of today, we currently have more than $300 million of cash on hand, which is in line with our minimum global cash balance range. Overall, we remain well positioned to drive growth. While we continue to see some budget pressures from clients in a slightly elevated level of client events, we continue to see healthy engagement from our clients in a strong pipeline to finish out 2023. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. And with that Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.
Q – Alex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone. I would like to talk about the index sales during the quarter. I think flat year-over-year. I think it was a tough comp and 3Q is generally a little bit lower seasonally. But just wondering if there's anything in particular you would highlight there both as -- in terms of the third quarter, but also as we think about the fourth quarter. And then maybe specifically on index sales, it looks like the custom index run rate was just marginally higher in the third quarter, quarter-over-quarter. So just wondering if that was a big and maybe why? Thanks.
A – Andy Wiechmann: Sure, sure. No, thanks, Alex. It's Andy here. I'd say nothing significant to note in the index results. I think you hit on probably the relevant points. More generally, I would say we continue to have pretty good momentum across module types and client segments. I think as Baer highlighted and I provided some more color, we had about 9% run rate growth in our market cap modules and mid to high-teens growth in our non-market cap-weighted modules. We had about 9% run rate growth from asset managers with solid double-digit growth across basically every other major client segment. As you alluded to, recurring sales were largely in line with Q3 of last year. Cancels were slightly higher, although the overall retention rate, we think, remains pretty good at 96.2%. Just on the cancels point, just to provide a bit more color there. We did have slightly higher cancels from mainly hedge funds and those were driven by client events, which we would expect in this environment. I'd say we do -- and this is something we've seen in recent periods, we do see some budget pressures from the environment and the equity markets more generally, although we do have very strong engagement and momentum heading into Q4, and we see that across client segments. And so as I mentioned, probably nothing too much to read into here, we continue to see good momentum across the franchise.
Alex Kramm: All right. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: The next question is from Alexander Hess with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Alexander Hess: Hi, guys. Maybe stepping back to some comments from last quarter about accelerating product development within ESG and Climate, I want to know maybe where you stand as far as that goes, how the Google partnership fits into that, how the Trove acquisition fits into that and any other considerations we should keep in mind as far as when that might show up in net new?
Baer Pettit: Sure. Hi, Baer here. So look, for sure, ESG and Climate product investment is central to a lot of our day-to-day activities and looking forward into next year. In both areas, we see significant market opportunities as we've laid out before, and this includes a variety of things, including expansion of the data, certain regional expansions, notably in Asia Pacific for ESG, where we've got a lot of demand for new types of data cards, greater company coverage, et cetera. So I think in ESG, it's a steady story driven also by the hailwinds brought by regulation. Clearly, in EMEA, in Europe, which we've mentioned in the past, but also in other regions increasingly. And then finally, in Climate, we're definitely at the investment phase there across client segments and across different asset classes and increasingly tying into the comments today, there's demand for climate information and solutions in private markets as well. So I think those -- all of those areas are very consistent with our comments from previous quarters. And we'll continue to have a positive impact on the growth story.
Alexander Hess: Thank you, Baer. And if I could quickly get a follow-up in. Can you maybe comment on how one of your competitors shedding headcount through a large layoff program might impact their competitive positioning vis-à-vis you guys?
Baer Pettit: Yeah. Look, as you know, we love to discuss our competitors specifically in all areas, we avoid that. I would try to say more broadly that I think that we're in a strong position to compete in the core business. We're clearly committed to it. Certain competitors may not be providing exactly the same services that we are in this instance, this competitor was cutting back in an area where we've chosen not to compete, I think, wisely. So I think overall, we're very committed to being a leader in this area, and we're confident that even in a tougher environment, we can continue our leadership position.
Alexander Hess: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I was hoping you could provide a little bit of extra color on ESG. It sounded from the prepared remarks like Europe maybe was somewhat flattish with America still under pressure. Just wanted to get a sense of if there are any catalysts coming up, if you're seeing more stability there that could help drives accelerated growth in upcoming quarters? Thanks.
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure, sure. Thanks, Toni. So I would say it's important to firstly underscore that we see a very strong engagement across ESG and Climate as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And I think it's clear, and you can see this from the retention rate that ESG and Climate are becoming and probably are mission-critical structural parts of the investment process already. And so I'd say the dynamics are pretty consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. We did to your point, see slower growth in the Americas. You know just to put a finer point on that, within the ESG and Climate segment, the growth in the Americas was around 15% versus 35% in EMEA and Europe and 22% in APAC. It's important to underscore that within ESG and climate, EMEA represents close to 50% of the run rate. So the largest region for us is growing at a pretty healthy growth rate of 35%. As I mentioned, sales were fairly flat year-over-year in EMEA and APAC, although they were softer in the Americas year-over-year. I think the dynamics that we're seeing in the US continue to play out where investors are being much more measured on how they integrate ESG and that's resulting in longer sales cycles, more deliberate purchasing decisions relative to what we saw a year plus ago. But I think given the range of users and use cases, as well as the strong engagement and retention rates that you're seeing, we're quite encouraged by the stability we've seen even in the Americas, even though it is a lower growth rate. I'd say the dynamics in EMEA continue to be the same. Baer alluded to this, but there's some element of regulation being a catalyst. It is also something that is resulting in longer sales cycles as well as investors and broader financial services firms to navigate these regulations, but it's one where we can be helpful to them as they think about how they're going to comply, and we have solutions and tools that will help on that front. There are some environmental impacts as well. It is worth noting that the equity investors, in particular, are under pressure, and we see some of that translating through to cyclical impacts. But we continue to have confidence in the long-term dynamics here and continue to believe this is a big long-term opportunity set for us.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Baer, in terms of the pipeline, the strong pipeline that you talked about, I was hoping you could just contextualize that a bit for us? I mean just if you look at the net new sales numbers, the first three quarters, it hasn't been that strong. So just perhaps what that looks like in Q4 and maybe how that -- how you see that heading into 2024? And then just a quick follow-up for Andy, just in terms of the margins that you gave us, for the fourth quarter. Maybe just some color, you increased the expense guidance, and it looks like Burgiss will be a drag for a bit next year. So just how should we think about if next year margins will just be constrained because of those dynamics?
Baer Pettit: So Manav, I think where you're talking about the overall sales pipeline at the firm. Am I correctly understanding that? Yes.
Manav Patnaik: Yes, that’s correct.
Baer Pettit: No, we think it's very healthy. We're very healthy. There's nothing there that would be abnormal of where we are today, allowing for the very uncertain environment for everyone, for our clients and some pressure on them. I still am happy to refer to it as either healthy or solid, right? So clearly, we're not generally here to try to fine-tune that excessively in the context of these calls, but there's certainly nothing there that I would call attention to other than to say it's solid and healthy and maybe pass it over to you, Andy, for the rest.
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. So maybe I can provide some color on the broader expense guidance, and then I can touch on Burgiss, specifically and the potential impact to the broader margin on the company. If you remember last quarter, we commented that if AUM levels remain flat or increase for the balance of the year, we'd likely be towards the high end of our expense guidance range. AUM was largely flat during the third quarter. And so our organic expense growth was picking up a little bit as we were picking up the pace of spend and importantly, picking up the pace of investment a little bit. And so we are tracking towards the higher end of the range. That combined with -- and this is probably the bigger impact, Burgiss expenses, which will be coming in in the fourth quarter. So we will have a full quarter of adjust expenses in Q4 here are leading to the higher overall expense guidance here. I would underscore that, that range assumes AUM levels remain roughly flat through the balance of the year. But to your point about the impact on the overall firm margin, Burgiss is a lower margin business. As we commented on a standalone basis, the margin is in the mid-teens on Burgiss. And so just bringing that in will bring the overall firm margin down. And so as we start to have Burgiss results in our overall financial results during 2024, the margin will likely be lower compared to the prior year. Having said that, we do, as I commented, believe that there is nice operating leverage, positive operating leverage in Burgiss, given what they do, very similar to most of the things MSCI does is they generate IP-based products and solutions that have very attractive margin dynamics. And so if we continue to drive the growth that we hope in Burgiss, that should drive some margin expansion within Burgiss, but just looking on an apples-to-apples basis, the Burgiss expense base will bring the overall firm margin down.
Operator: The next question is from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. Your line is open.
Kelsey Zhu: Thanks for taking my question. I have a quick one on ESG and Climate. The run rate growth looks much stronger for Climate compared to ESG. I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about the key drivers behind the divergence between the performances between those two segments? And as you think about the long-term growth target for the second overall in the mid- to high 20s range, does that work similar across ESG and Climate? And lastly, just what net new subscription sales growth looks like for Climate and ESG separately in Q3? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So maybe on -- there are a few questions in there, but I'll try to tackle them in turn here. So within Climate, it is a distinct offering. There is an overlap, and it is heavily related to our ESG research and ratings, then it feeds into it to varying degrees, depending on the company and the sector, but the solutions we have in climate are distinct. And so we offer a range of solutions that help clients to integrate climate considerations into their investment process, achieve Net Zero goals and overall climate objectives to navigate specific considerations in specific areas, as well as to understand systematically climate risk and how that can impact the performance of a portfolio. I would say climate, and you can tell this by the run rate, which is $98 million across all product lines at MSCI within our ESG and Climate segment it's around $54 million. It is small compared to ESG. And so, we're still very early in the adoption curve of climate tools. Clients are still evolving in their thinking and just beginning to integrate climate and they are really just starting to think about how to navigate everything from regulations to Net Zero objectives that they have. And so we would expect higher growth within Climate relative to ESG, where ESG, we've been providing for quite some time and I think is more established. It's still relatively young compared to other product lines. But it is more penetrated and I'd say more broadly used than ESG. And so we would expect climate to continue to drive outsized growth relative to ESG more broadly. I think you touched on the long-term targets as well. I would say, we haven't made any changes to our long-term targets in any area, including in ESG and Climate. As I was commenting on, we continue to be very excited about the long-term opportunities in both ESG and Climate. And as I alluded to on both fronts, we are still very early in the evolution of these areas, and there continue to be numerous opportunities for us across Client segments, asset classes, geographies, solutions. And so we continue to believe there is a big long-term opportunity in ESG and Climate. There are some cyclical factors at play which are impacting growth in the short term and other dynamics that we've talked about. But overall, we continue to think there is a big long-term opportunity where we are, I believe, quite well prepared to capitalize. I think, I gave some of this color to an earlier question. I think your last question was about ESG versus Climate growth in Q3. And in my prepared remarks, I did touch on that a bit. The ESG growth was around 21%. Within -- this is the subscription run rate growth for ESG was around 21%. This is within our ESG and Climate segment. And within Climate, it was around 45% for the run rate within our ESG and Climate segment associated with our climate tools. I think Baer mentioned the overall run rate for Climate is $98 million, and that was growing closer to 48%. And that cuts across tools in every product segment that we have.
Kelsey Zhu: Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on pricing. Pricing was a significant deal went to net new this year. I was wondering, a lot of companies are talking about normalizing pricing as we get into next year. I was just wondering, if you could comment on how do you think about the pricing trend as we get into 2024? And have you seen any pushback on pricing, particularly for netting tax?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yeah. So we've -- to this point, we've been successful at rolling out higher price increases, although, it's modest increases relative to what we've done in the past. I would say in the third quarter, price increases contributed a comparable amount to what they've contributed in recent quarters. So across all product areas, price increases represented mid- to high 30% of new recurring sales within the index, it was 40% plus which is consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. Clearly, there are varying degrees of pushback depending on the product and region and client type, and we are very cognizant of the fact that many of our clients are feeling pressure in the current environment. And so we try to be very measured and try to ensure that we are delivering value together with any price increases. So, we are very focused on ensuring that we're enhancing the solutions that we are rolling out pricing increases on. But also, oftentimes, we are delivering more product, more usage, additional solutions to clients together with price increases to ensure that we are adding value to them. We do monitor the overall market. One of the inputs, one of many inputs into our pricing equation is the broader inflationary environment. If inflation does continue to moderate, that will be an input into us potentially moderating price in the future, but it's something that we continue to calibrate. And as I said, the biggest factor is ensuring that we can deliver value to our clients when we do roll out price increases.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful, sir. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Owen Lau: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to go back to expense guidance and ask the question a bit differently. So you raised the full year OpEx guidance by about $40 million and based on my math, Burgiss $20 million per quarter this year. And I think you mentioned $4 million to $5 million of acquisition-related expense. My question is, how about the rest of the expense increase? And how much of that incremental expense would be recurring in 2024? Thank you.
Andrew Wiechmann: Got it. I don't want to get into 2024 at this stage. That's something we will cover when we release our Q4 results as we typically do. I would just point to, and I made this comment to the earlier question. Our prior adjusted EBITDA expense guidance was $965 million to $995 million. We had said a quarter ago, if AUM levels remain flat or increase, we'd be towards the higher end of that range. And so AUM levels over the third quarter, as I mentioned, have been relatively flat. And so we -- on an organic basis, we're tracking towards the high end of that range. And then as you said, the Burgiss expenses before you layer on things like allocations and the integration expenses will add $20 million or so in that vicinity of additional expense. And so that's how you bridge to the new expense guidance that we put out.
Owen Lau: All right. That's fantastic. And I just want to add one quick question on ESG and Climate seasonality. So over the past few years, I think for net new recurring subscription sales of ESG and Climate was quite strong in the fourth quarter. Should we expect similar seasonality to continue this year? Thank you.
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. I wouldn't -- I don't want to give specific color on segments. As Baer mentioned earlier that the pipeline is healthy, I would say, given the nature of our business. And as you alluded to, we do see some seasonality in the fourth quarter based on what you've seen in past years. I think there are a number of factors that feed into that, including client budgets, their purchasing decisions. We also have annual incentive plans that feed into that. And we also have the highest concentration of client renewals taking place in the fourth quarter. So for all those factors, we tend to see a higher fourth quarter. That's not always the case. But as we had mentioned, there's a healthy pipeline going into Q4.
Owen Lau: Sounds great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In ESG and Climate, you mentioned growth slowed in the Americas to 15%, while growth in EMEA was healthy at 35%. Can you elaborate on what you're seeing in the Americas and when you would expect to see catalysts for improved growth?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes, sure. So I'd say, we're seeing consistent themes in the Americas compared to what we've seen in recent quarters. So as investors, managers, broader financial services firms are integrating ESG and launching ESG strategies or plan to launch ESG strategies, they have to focus on a range of considerations, including how it aligns with their overall investment objectives. So what is the impact that ESG considerations will have on risk and return? And how do I optimize my risk-adjusted returns by incorporating ESG into my investment process? How do I differentiate relative to my competitors? How do I address the ESG objectives that my clients have or that the investors have, and then for new products that they launch how do they communicate their approach to ESG and how do they again position themselves relative to other products in the market and how do they prepare forecoming regulations, which is not just a factor in EMEA, but it's something that US investors have to deal with as well. And so, it is a -- it's a complex environment for them to integrate ESG. The good news is we are in a good position to help them navigate that. And so when we say our clients are engaging strongly, they want to have those conversations with us. But because of that complexity, because of all those factors that feed into their buying decisions, we are seeing more measured purchasing decisions, longer sales cycles, ultimately a lower amount of sales. But overall, the engagement level is healthy, but we do expect these complexities and longer sales cycles to continue and persist for some time in the Americas. I think these factors at play on top of the cyclical factors will probably persist for some quarters here.
Operator: The next question is from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So I wanted a bit more color on the Analytics segment. You've seen run rate growth accelerate here. So I would love to hear more about where you might have invested and where you're seeing the acceleration and how you think about the competitive dynamics in that segment?
Baer Pettit: Sure. Thank you for the question. Baer here. So what I would frame it is to say we've got three key areas of focus. The front office, both in equities and fixed income, and you saw we had very nice numbers in equities. More content, which includes insights, better coverage of private assets, doing better and being more competitive in fixed income and structured products and climate risk. So those are the key areas we're focused on and I think that we're pleased with, well, I would say we're definitely not happy with the growth number. We think we'd look to continue to be ambitious to see it go up. The retention rate of 95% is also a sign that our clients continue to use our tools in these environments. So we've been very consistent in the story here. I think we continue to have structural improvements in how we deliver the products through better technology, greater integration of our content across different types of analytics. And in keeping with the theme that we've repeated here, our client engagement is excellent, and we have a wide variety of use cases that clients are asking us to solve from going across very large firm use cases to very specific structured products, front office use cases, equity portfolio construction. So it's just a category where with the combination of our investments in content, better technology and better delivery and the expertise that we bring to clients, we hope to continue to have a good directional growth. The only thing I would add just as a slight note of caution is it is an uncertain and amicable environment and client events can occur, but those are often things that we don't control ourselves.
Operator: The next question is from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Seth Weber: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you. I know it's early days, but with the Burgiss acquisition, when you announced it, you talked about good opportunities for joint product development and cross-selling. I'm just wondering if you could talk to any early traction that you're seeing there. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Yeah. So the Burgiss acquisition strategically is very -- it provides an extremely strong foundation for us to develop what we call the MSCI or the private asset classes. We, obviously, need the data and by the data, I mean, understanding of an investment and pricing of those investments to then develop the whole portfolio of investment tools that are used by allocators and managers of assets. And that portfolio of investment tools are benchmarked indices, performance attribution, risk analysis, risk management, liquidity and how we manage liquidity in terms of private assets cash flows, when are you going to get the calls, when are you going to get reception, redemptions and all of that, what it's called pacing models, asset allocation, et cetera. So the first -- so if you were to think about the integration of Burgiss, it's going to follow in three parallel tracks. The first track is clearly integration of a lot of the support functions in HR and in office space, in accounting and finance and all of that and the integration of and the alignment of the data and the data centers and technology and all of that, right? So obviously, integration of the sales force at the front office salespeople Burgiss with the front office salespeople or MSCI and all that. So that's one bucket. The second bucket over time is going to be new product development. And a big focus here would be one of the most recently -- the most frequently asked questions from clients is, are we going to develop better benchmark indices for private assets. So that will be something that will be high on the agenda for sure. But we're going to continue to expand dramatically on the intersection of private assets and climate, especially, private credit and climate. And we already started with that, but we're only scratching the surface there. That's a major expansion on that second pillar, the product line. The third pillar, which is actually the fastest one that we're going to execute on and more from loaded one is we believe that the Burgiss product line is severely undersold among LPs around the world. And we're taking steps to change that in having a lot of the Burgiss sales people working in coordination with our senior salespeople all over the world. So there are three pillars. Clearly, we want to get the money first in sales and significantly outpaced the sales growth of the business. We clearly need to integrate. And over time, we clearly want to create a lot of new products in that middle piece of analytics, right?
Operator: The next question is from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open. 
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Two questions. First, just with regards to capital allocation. You talked about how it's important to the company. So I thought it would be helpful to just ask kind of how you're thinking about capital allocation as you integrate Burgiss? And are you prioritizing buybacks versus M&A? What does the M&A pipeline look like? And then as a quick follow-up, you gave the growth numbers for ESG in the US and EMEA for the quarter. Can you put that in -- just compare that to what it looked like in the first half of the year? Has it -- has Europe the growth rate that you saw? Is that consistent with the first half? Is it a pickup? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So to look on -- in your first question about capital allocation, needless to say, we've talked a great deal about this in the past. We are always obsessed with asset allocation at MSCI. We believe that capital allocation is what gives you long-term compounding growth of a business, and it is the day-to-day capital allocation decisions that you make that ultimately aggregate to a great financial model and a great compounder over time. So that's an area that we're very focused on. And it is in two respects. One is the internal capital allocation of where we put our money with respect to organic investments, and we follow what we call the triple crown methodology, which we've talked about in the past. And then there is the "external" asset allocation, which is what do we do with dividends, with buybacks and with inorganic investments that we pursue. So with respect to the latter category, the "external part", in periods of very bullish environment asset prices are very rich. Investment or inorganic investments are very rich. Acquisitions are in options, people are tripping over each other. They bid up the properties, and you end up significantly overpaying. So in periods like that, we tend to stay -- we stay out. We have done the RCA acquisition was in the middle of our average period. But we -- in general, we are very financially disciplined about that. So we end up generating a lot of excess cash, and therefore, most of that excess cash flows back to buy back shares. In periods of high uncertainty and high unpredictability, people retrench, people hide, Board of Directors are risk averse and the like and those are periods in which we believe we can make very nice financially disciplined acquisitions and that's what we've seen in the last few months, the Burgiss acquisition, the Trove acquisition and the like. And so we'll continue to see – we'll continue to pursue a small -- relatively small bolt-on acquisitions that will use up a lot of our cash. So therefore -- and the last piece of this thing is financing. Right now, the financing environment is very expensive. We are delevering. We're at 3.1 times, 3.2 times leverage right now in leverage, maybe less. And therefore, we don't have a keen interest in increasing our debt -- our leverage at this point. So therefore, when you combine all of that, it means that we're going to have very limited cash, excess capital for buybacks in the next few quarters. And we will continue to pursue a small bolt-on acquisitions, because the market is attractive for that. And we -- unless we see some in bigger, we're likely not going to lever up at this point given this financing rates. So that's a little bit of our financial strategy overall in capital allocation at this time.
Andrew Wiechmann: And then just quickly on your second question, I would say that if I look at growth rates in the second quarter, the subscription run rate growth rates by region for ESG and Climate, they're largely consistent with the figures that I quoted this quarter. So similar dynamic where the Americas is in the teens. EMEA is in the mid-30s and APAC's in the low to mid-20s, so very consistent.
Operator: The next question is from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.
Russell Quelch: Yes, hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me on. I think you did a great job of implementing a downturn playbook last year in difficult markets. You said much more cost flex than some of your peers. I was wondering, can you do this again next year if we see a big fall in equity market levels perhaps what areas of the business could you look to take costs out? And maybe do you already have some plans in place in case 2024 gets off to a tricky start, particularly in equity markets?
Henry Fernandez: We've always been extremely financially disciplined. And that clearly continues to be more -- we definitely have an ability to take out more cost. That's what we call the downturn playbook that we can put into effect in order to protect profitability in the company. If there is a big downdraft of obviously, equity values and slowdown in subscriptions, our desire, not our ability, but our desire to cut severely the new investments in the company may not be commensurate with the decline in -- with the slowdown in revenues. So we'll have to analyze that trade-off at that point. But for sure, we are committed to high levels of profitability and high levels of impact for investment in good times and in bad times.
Operator: The next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.
Craig Huber: Yes. Hi. Thank you. Andy, my first question, your costs in all four segments look to us like they were down sequentially. Can you just touch on that and also in light of your overall cost guidance for the year, which just interesting me that the costs were down in the third quarter. Why is that? That's my first question.
Andrew Wiechmann: Yeah. So nothing specific to call out there other than -- and I think you see this in other quarters. Our costs will move around quarter-to-quarter based on a range of factors, including things like less recurring type of costs, nonrecurring costs, professional fees, it can be things like comp accrual adjustments related to the outlook and it can be related to things like severance and pace of spend. So there's nothing specifically to call out on the expense side relative to Q2. And so I wouldn't read into any sort of trend there. I would focus more on the guidance that we've given.
Operator: Our final question is from Greg Simpson with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Greg Simpson: Hey, good morning, yes. Can I just ask on the expense growth in the ESG and Climate. It looks like it's been below your mid-to-high 20s medium-term guidance. The EBITDA margin, I think, is north of 30% now. So I just wanted to check in on if there's any kind of change around investments in this segment versus any kind of slowdown on the cost side? Thank you.
Andrew Wiechmann: Yeah, nothing to read into there and no changes in generally the plans or outlook investing in ESG and Climate. It's one that we are continually calibrating as we calibrate across all segments based on the opportunities in front of us and the overall financial objectives. An ESG and Climate continues to be an attractive growth area with big opportunities. So we do plan to continue to invest in that area. The margin will -- related to the last question, expenses, expense growth and margin will fluctuate period-to-period based on a whole host of things. When you start to look at product segments, you can see some noise based on allocations moving, you can see some noise based on capitalization of software development costs. And you can see some other expense movement related to, as I alluded to perform kind of nonrecurring non-comp-type expenses or other accrual adjustments that we have. But I wouldn't focus too much on the margin in ESG and Climate this segment and as I alluded to earlier, no change to our long-term targets.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it over to Henry Fernandez for any closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: So thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And despite the more uncertain and more predictable environment, economically, financially, geopolitically, we continue to benefit from a great all-weather franchise. Our desire is to be a compounder in good times and in bad times. And we're very excited about all the opportunities that we see ahead of us in all of our product lines from index, to analytics, to ESG and climate and now obviously private assets and the opportunities we can unlock with Burgiss and with Trove. We didn't talk much about the voluntary capital markets and the opportunities there, but those will be very significant. So we look forward to updating you in future calls about all of our plans and our progress in all of this. And again, thanks for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter 2023. This press release, along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today’s presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today’s call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You will find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We, therefore, caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. We will also discuss organic growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. As a final housekeeping item, beginning on next earnings call for the third quarter, we will request our analysts to ask question at a time during the Q&A portion of our call in order to reflect the growth in our brokerage coverage and allow larger participation. As always, analysts will be welcome to ask more questions by adding themselves back to the queue. And our goal is to devote more of our earnings call to the Q&A segment. With that let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez , Henry.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the second quarter, MSCI delivered another solid performance against a fluid market environment. We achieved adjusted EPS growth of 17%, organic revenue growth of 13% and organic subscription run rate growth of 11%. We also maintain our laser focus on profitability, demonstrating rigorous financial and capital management. Our capital allocation framework has not changed. We will opportunistically buy back shares, support our dividend policy and accelerate our strategy through bolt-on acquisitions. Most notably, our share repurchases since the beginning of the second quarter have totaled nearly $468 million. MSCI has repurchased close to 50 million shares or nearly 40% of our total shares outstanding from the end of 2012, and we intend to keep the same focus and discipline. All of this confirms the strength and durability of our business. One of our consistent differentiators is that MSCI can be nimble and flexible in significantly adjusting expenses up and down, depending on the operating environment. This helped stabilize our profitability through periods of market turmoil. More broadly, MSCI continues to benefit from our globally diversified and integrated franchise. In the second quarter, we delivered our 28th consecutive quarter of double-digit subscription run rate growth in index. We also had a strong quarter in Analytics, posting our highest second quarter retention rate ever of over 95% and recurring net new sales growth of 46% in equity portfolio management. In addition, we delivered 70% climate run rate growth across our product lines, along with a climate retention rate of over 97%. Our ESG run rate growth firmwide grew 18%, and the retention rate from our ESG and Climate product segment remain resilient at 97%. This shows that despite tightening budgets, our clients continue to make ESG and Climate a top priority. During my recent client trips to Asia, the Middle East, Western Europe and parts of the U.S., ESG was the most popular topic clients wanted to discuss. For that matter, when the IBM Institute for Business Value recently surveyed corporate executives across 22 industries, 76% of them said ESG is now central to their business strategy. This reinforces our belief that ESG risks and opportunities are investment risks and opportunities. With all of that in mind, MSCI is working to accelerate our ESG and Climate product launches. Our climate solutions continue to drive growth across the company, and they have helped us build momentum across client segments. This gets to a larger point. The integration and interoperability of our product line, what we call our one MSCI ecosystem, can dramatically increase value and efficiency for our clients. We further amplify those benefits through our open architecture for clients and other outside parties and through MSCI's role as a standard setter, industry connector and innovation hub. All of this represents our greatest competitive advantage as a company. It highlights our unique position in the industry, our unique mix of capabilities and our unique range of client segments. Indeed, MSCI is now well placed to capitalize on major trends in shaping the industry. Those trends include the acceleration and of the adoption of index investing; the continued shift to algorithm-oriented, rules-based technology-driven portfolio construction; the rise in demand for sustainable investments and climate solutions; the growing role of regulation; and the increased allocations to private assets. As our strategy evolves to capture new opportunities, which will require new investments, MSCI will stay firmly committed to financial discipline and high profitability. Those commitments have always anchored our strategy in the past, and they will continue anchoring our strategy in the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Baer.
Baer Pettit : Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. My comments today will cover MSCI's business performance and also provide an update on our continued technology transformation. Our flagship index segment achieved another milestone, including 12% subscription run rate growth with 14% growth in Asia Pacific. We drove record onetime sales primarily from our recently launched float data products, which delivered nearly $8 million in gross sales. These deals facilitate deep engagement with clients while creating entry points for future recurring subscription sales. We also achieved record second quarter results for net new and new recurring sales in index. Globally, there were 20 newly available ETF products based on MSCI indexes during the quarter, 12 of which were based on MSCI ESG and Climate index. During the quarter, 96% of industry inflows into ETF products domiciled and sponsored by European fund managers were linked to MSCI indexes. All of this confirms the critical and growing role that our index segment plays in global investing, trading and portfolio construction. Turning to our ESG and Climate reporting segment. We delivered overall run rate growth of 26%, while our retention rate was nearly 97%. As I can confirm from my client meetings during the quarter, demand for our ESG products remains high, fueled by regulatory pressure for high-quality data, MSCI's comprehensive coverage and the transparency provided by our solutions. Looking at Climate subscription specifically. We delivered run rate growth of over 40% with both asset managers and asset owners and over 75% run rate growth with banks, insurance, wealth management and hedge funds collectively. Meanwhile, AUM in ETF products based on MSCI climate indexes totaled $71 billion at the end of June, which represented approximately 67% market share on the basis of AUM. As with ESG, both government regulations and voluntary disclosures continue to drive demand for advanced climate tools. Let me now turn to our Analytics segment. During the second quarter, MSCI achieved subscription run rate growth of 6.6% in Analytics, including 13% growth in equity portfolio management with notable strength in the hedge fund segment. We also posted our highest second quarter ever for retention at 95.2% and net new sales of about $11 million in Analytics. By providing investment risk and performance workflows in Analytics, we develop deep connectivity and access to client portfolios. This in turn helps us deliver additional innovative services, such as our ESG and Climate regulatory reporting solutions, including for the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. In fact, during the first half of 2023, MSCI delivered more than 47,000 total climate reports enabled by our Analytics reporting engines. Shifting to our Real Assets segment. It was a tough quarter in a challenging environment with historically low global commercial real estate activity. In that environment, our Real Assets segment posted overall run rate growth of 9% excluding FX and a retention rate of close to 93%. Regionally, we also achieved 14% Real Assets run rate growth in Asia Pacific, 10% growth in the Americas and 8% growth in EMEA. As MSCI explores new ways to turn raw data into actionable investment insights, we continue moving forward with our technology transformation. Generative AI and large language models are a big part of that. We've been using AI and natural language processing for a decade now to enhance our content. Given our deep expertise in modeling and data analysis, this is second nature to MSCI. In ESG research, for example, AI helps us analyze and update more than 7 million data points per month with inputs from more than 4,700 news sources, 150 alternative data sources, 12,000 corporate websites and submissions from more than 5,200 corporate issuers. We have also used generative AI and LLM to help us identify, extract and validate EU taxonomy data 4x faster than our previous capabilities. These data represent crucial inputs for EU regulatory reporting. In Analytics, we use natural language processing and deep learning in our models to identify securities with similar characteristics, to examine emerging industries and to support quantitative investment testing and systematic alpha use cases. We're also deploying AI in our corporate functions such as finance to help automate contract review, extract information and process invoice. MSCI is embracing generative AI to enhance the client experience and operate more efficiently. In particular, we are leveraging AI to continue evolving our data processing, audit and quality mechanism. In addition, we are working to integrate AI into our MSCI ONE platform to proactively deliver actionable insights for client portfolios. Investments in data and technology are central to our long-term strategy. Combining those investments with our strong commercial focus supports our ability to deliver solid performance amid external challenges. I'm confident that by staying focused and disciplined in our operations and financial management, MSCI will be able to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. And with that, let me turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andrew Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hi, everyone. During the quarter, it was encouraging to see the breadth of opportunities and diversity of revenue streams driving our solid top line growth. This included very strong nonrecurring revenue, which more than offset some of the lingering cyclical impacts we saw in parts of our asset-based fees. And we delivered solid double-digit subscription run rate growth with a remarkably stable retention rate despite some of the market pressures. In Index, client demand was broad-based with double-digit subscription run rate growth for all of our subproduct areas, including market cap modules, ESG and Climate modules, factor modules and custom index offerings. Our run rate growth with asset managers and asset owners was 10% and 12%, respectively. Collectively, these client segments represent about 70% of our index subscription run rate. Asset-based fees have swung to positive growth driven by a rebound in AUM-linked revenues, which were supported by both market appreciation and strong inflows. Since the end of March, we've seen $18.7 billion of inflows into MSCI-linked equity ETFs, which combined with a gradual rebound in market levels has driven AUM balances to increase by over $67 billion. There were net inflows of $15.6 billion into MSCI-linked ETFs with geographic exposures to developed markets outside the U.S. and $3.1 billion of inflows into MSCI-linked ETFs with emerging market exposures. From a product lens, there were $5.2 billion of inflows into ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and Climate indexes, while $2.5 billion of inflows went to ETFs linked to MSCI factor indexes fueled by strong flows into the quality factor. In fact, the AUM balance of equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes was greater than $1.4 trillion as of July 20th. Volumes from listed futures and options linked to MSCI indexes were lower year-over-year relative to the high volatility environment we saw a year ago. This is consistent with what we would expect to see when AUM balances rebound. In Analytics, subscription run rate growth was 7%. We had another quarter of very strong equity factor model sales as clients continue to turn to us to help understand risk and market factors in this dynamic environment. And our strong retention rate underscores the mission-critical nature of our tools, particularly in these challenging times. In June, we delivered roughly 47,000 liquidity analytics reports per day for our clients, which is up 15% from our average daily levels in December. We now process over 850 million security holdings daily on behalf of our clients in Analytics, a testament to the scale at which investors rely on us for their most important portfolio decisions. And the capabilities across Analytics are incredibly strategic for the firm, helping to fuel growth across product areas. Although, as we've mentioned before, we continue to expect new sales and cancels to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter in Analytics. In our ESG and Climate reportable segment, our run rate grew 26% with 22% growth in ESG and 50% growth in Climate. The volume of large ticket deals has improved from last quarter, although still down from last year's levels. Net new recurring sales improved 20% since the first quarter but were down meaningfully from a record second quarter last year, reflecting more measured purchasing decisions and longer sales cycles from our clients. We continue to have conviction in our long-term targets of mid-to high-20% growth given the numerous layers of opportunities and the powerful secular drivers. As Henry and Baer mentioned, our long-term opportunities remain durable and attractive for both ESG and Climate. In Real Assets, we drove 9% organic run rate growth. As Baer indicated, our benchmarking and market and portfolio insights offerings remain strong with double-digit organic growth, while sales and retention of our transaction data products were more muted as they are cyclically correlated with the reduced volume of commercial real estate transactions. We continue to execute on our real asset product road map, and we are seeing early and encouraging demand for products like our mortgage debt intel offering. These solid operating results across the business helped drive 17% growth in adjusted EPS in the second quarter. Helping to fuel the growth, we had very strong nonrecurring revenue in the quarter, benefiting from strong sales of our index free float product. While these nonrecurring revenues will fluctuate meaningfully quarter-to-quarter, we continue to see healthy growth in the underlying demand for many of the products that are often sold as nonrecurring, such as index licenses for OTC derivatives, history data products and other unique data sets as well as analytics implementations. Importantly, these sales often open the door for broader conversations and can convert into recurring subscriptions. Share repurchases drove $0.06 of the year-over-year increase as our consistent approach allowed us to continue to capitalize on attractive opportunities. It's worth noting that our free cash flow conversion and collections were reasonably strong in the quarter although we continue to remain somewhat cautious on collection activity for the balance of the year. We ended June with a cash balance of nearly $800 million, enabling us to remain positioned for strength. Finally, I would like to provide some color on our 2023 guidance, which remains mostly unchanged and assumes market levels remain relatively flat for the balance of the year. We have left our expense guidance ranges unchanged. Although if market levels remain stable at current levels or increase further, we could be towards the top half of our expense ranges. On CapEx, we have modestly increased our guidance range, mainly reflecting our increased pace of capitalized software development costs. We remain excited and encouraged by the strong client engagement we are seeing across numerous growth opportunities, and we continue to be closely aligned with employees to capitalize on the long-term trends transforming the investment industry. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about the recent ESG regulatory proposal in Europe. I guess as it reads now, how do you see it impacting your business? And are there structural changes needed? Or are you operating already in a way that would comply with the new rules?
Baer Pettit : Hi, Toni, Baer here. So look, a few observations. So the first one is that we do think we're well positioned to make this transition to the new regulatory environment. There are certain standards and ways of operating inherent to the regulation, which, as you suggested, I believe we're meeting. But there will inevitably be some new aspects to that, but those will also hit all of our competitors. So it's a level playing field in that regard. And we believe that we, as we in index, we can be a leader in meeting regulatory standards. And then more broadly, our regulation is in parallel with our clients' regulation. And in turn, what that reflects is how critical the sustainability agenda is in Europe. And overall, that creates a significant opportunity for us.
Toni Kaplan: Great. Wanted to also ask about on the index side of the business, you had very strong success over a long period of time. I guess, first, could we see the ESG slowdown start to impact the index business at all just given ESG indices revenue is embedded in there? And maybe also when you think about sustainability of growth within indices itself, do you see any changes in the environment going forward or just still structurally similar to what we've seen over the last number of quarters and years?
Henry Fernandez: So first of all, we believe strongly based on plan discussions and strategy meetings among ourself that the index opportunity, it's only begun, that this trend will continue for years and decades to come. And it's predicated on our view and our clients' view that indices are basis of portfolios, indices are tools to build portfolios. And the more comprehensive and global the portfolio is in terms of security selection, the more the need for underlying information and underlying organization of that. It's mentioned about securities in the context of an index, which then becomes the basis of our portfolio. So we saw this trend on market exposures with market cap indices, which continues unabated. We then moved on to factor indices, which have become very, very popular and continue to grow. We then moved on to ESG indices. We're now very much into the climate index phase. We're also accelerating our thematic indices. So if you think about it, we're in addition to market cap indices, which are simple exposures to market, we are moving into what we call nonmarket cap indices, which are indices built on demand on an investment thesis and demand for -- by clients. So again, these are ways of organizing the securities of the world according to certain variables, whether it's an industry variable, a climate, a thematic, a factor or whatever, variable, and they become extremely valuable for people who are building portfolios across those variables. Whether they want to then launch an active management product, whether they want to launch a passive one, whether they want to launch structured products or listed derivatives, it's all the same concept, which is a basket -- a large basket of securities organized in different ways. To achieve that, you need to have a lot of underlying information about those securities. You have to know everything about their ESG profile, their climate profile, their thematic profile, their factor profile. So MSCI is turning into a giant equity research shop to try to understand the characteristics of securities so we can organize them that way. And everywhere we go in our shareholder base, people are waiting for the shoe to drop on the index business, and we think it's the opposite. We think that this business will accelerate in the years to come in all the use cases. We're now witnessing the direct indexing revolution as well that is going to make it more efficient to build personalized, customized individual portfolios. So anyhow, so I think that is where we are. That's what we see from our clients. That's what we see from the ground up and the like. And with respect to ESG, we're big believers that ESG is investment risk. And it's not we. Our clients are telling us, ESG is investment risk. ESG is part of the fundamental analysis of securities. It cannot be avoided. So therefore, that will continue unabated in all aspects, whether it's ratings or research or screening, but importantly, in the foundational element of building indices.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS Financial.
Alex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone. A quick question on ESG and Climate. I think when I compare today's sentiment and tone from you guys relative to last quarter, there's a markedly more positive sentiment. Now I don't know if that is because last quarter, you were talking a lot about the political and regulatory paralysis. In this quarter, you will focus more on the long term. So maybe you can just talk about why the more positive tone. And then importantly, given that there was a little bit more focus on the long term today, which is understandable, how do you feel about the near term? Very slight improvement quarter-over-quarter, but clearly still a lot of uncertainty.
Henry Fernandez: So, Manav, the reality is we feel exactly the same a quarter ago that we feel today. Maybe in the call, we go into political issues or this or that, and therefore, it can mess up the message. And that's a problem that we blame it on us. In terms of communicating the overriding message is, and therefore, we feel fundamentally the same. And by the way, look, we're not [inaudible], we're not philosophers, we're not idealogue. We are grounded business people, and we see what our clients are going through in the investment process. And we talk to them extensively. We review that among us and all of that, and there is no alternative path but to believe that ESG will continue to be central to the investment process. It was a client of ours who said to me one time, look, Henry, this is very simple. The 70 years of fundamental analysis of security is focused on market, products, competition and all that. They never focus on the internal workings of the company. And what ESG partly is about the internal workings of the company. What are the motivations? What are the governance issues? What are the social issues of, how do they view the environmental issues and all of that, and that should be part of the investment process. So therefore, I think in my view, look, and this is not just me speaking, I was just on the road for six months talking to clients all over the world. And the answer was that, Alex, is that honestly, everyone wants to talk about this because when I incorporate it in what they do every single day. Look, we can argue all day long. We can look, talk at the political picture, the big picture and all of that. But from the ground up, we do not know anybody in the world that doesn't want to take ESG considerations into account in the creation of the investment process. One last thing that I would say is that even in those states in the U.S. where there is a lot of political pressure on the pension plan to abandon looking at, I think, from the ESG perspective, the people -- the investment teams of those places are telling us that they cannot do that because the rest of the world is going to take them into account. And if they do, it's going to lead to repricing of securities. And they don't want to get caught holding the bag. So look, that is the bottom-up, on-the-ground description on what happens. And we can talk about it all day long as to whether, trying but what I'm telling you is the reality is that it is investment risk, it is investment opportunity, it is fundamental to the investment process. And people are going to have to continue to take it into account for decades and generations to come.
Alex Kramm: All right. Fair enough. Thanks for that. And then just switching gears very quickly on the Analytics side. Noted, obviously, the strong performance, new sales, et cetera. I think you've also, given the inflationary environment, been a little bit more strong on price. So maybe you can just differentiate how much came from pricing relative to new logos or new core sales. And given that the inflationary environment is probably softening a little bit, just wondering how you feel about the sustainability of growth in Analytics.
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. Alex, it's Andy. So maybe just more broadly touching on price increases. We continue to get traction rolling out higher increases than we have in recent years. The contribution to overall recurring sales, new recurring sales continues to be relatively consistent across the company with what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, which is mid-30% contribution to overall new sales. Analytics, as you alluded to, we have been rolling out, like the rest of the company, higher price increases. Although, I'd say we are being more measured and more strategic. We focus heavily on the use of our product, the health of the client, the value that we are adding. And that's probably the most important point, the continued value that we're adding to the product and the service that we're delivering as well as the clients' overall usage of our tools. I think it is an important lever for us, and I think it's something we'll continue to focus on here. Obviously, we do monitor the overall pricing environment. But I think the broader considerations around the value that we're adding in client usage are probably more important on the Analytics side.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik : Yes, hi. If I could just follow up on the ESG segment. Just looking out into the second half, I guess, it's a little bit hard to figure out some kind of seasonality in that net new business number over the last couple of years. If you could just help us with what you expect in the second half, especially in the context of, I think, Henry, you mentioned an acceleration of new products in the ESG and Climate. Is that going to start impacting second half already?
Henry Fernandez: So Manav, I'm sorry if I misspoke earlier. I didn't recognize the German accent versus the Indian accent. Sorry about that. But look, it's hard to say. I mean the pipeline remains pretty good and pretty solid. Some things are going to accelerate from ESG, some things may not. In the context of clearly there is a consolidation process going on in Europe, people trying to make sure they classify their funds, they comply to the regs and all that. In the U.S., they're looking for the same things. But in reality, our clients are coming to us and asking us for a lot more ESG information. They want to have more. They want more granularity of the data. They want to organize in a way that they can analyze it better because they now have a higher risk of regulatory compliance issues. They want us to be, to put more pieces describing this whole process for the marketing campaign. They want a significant expansion of the coverage of the universe of issuers that we raised on ESG. They want changes to the ESG methodologies in some respects. They want an update on what we -- how we're incorporating climate into ESG and so on and so forth. So we have a lot a demand for what we do. And of course, over time, that will translate into sales. Right now, we're in a cyclical soft period in ESG, and it's logical. We've been running at neck break pace for years now. And there have been changes going on in the regulatory environment in Europe because there's been noise in the political environment in the U.S. and all of that. But at the end of the day, people are now focused on how are they going to continue to integrate this in a fashion that is even more granular, even more prescriptive, even more comprehensive and all of that. And that's why we're looking to expand on. So our investment will have to increase and our sales over time, beyond these cyclical stocks, are going to increase.
Manav Patnaik : Got it. Okay. And then last quarter, you talked about M&A pretty proactively. And I guess with the stock pullback, you went into the buyback -- into the stock buyback market, which made sense. So just any updates on that M&A pipeline?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. So Manav, maybe I'll just broaden it to our approach to capital allocation, and then I can touch on M&A. So I would underscore, and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, that our approach to capital allocation really remains unchanged and consistent. We are focused on delivering a consistent and increasing dividend, pursuing opportunistic share buybacks and continually focused on strategic bolt-on M&A. And so as you saw in the quarter, our approach to repurchases has remained consistent, where we tend to repurchase more when we have more cash, when we see more volatility and when we see share prices where we have more conviction. And those three factors lined up in the quarter, and so we took advantage. On the M&A point, listen, we continue to actively explore a number of opportunities. We have seen an increase in conversations due to the harder environment for capital raising for many early-stage companies that would be strategic for us. And we are hoping we can find some unique opportunities, but we remain disciplined. And so we're going to continue to remain very disciplined on price and strategic fit. And by their nature, M&A is opportunistic. And so there's no certainty around it, but bolt-on M&A remains a key focus for us and part of our strategy.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Alexander Hess with JPMorgan.
Alexander Hess: Yes, hi. Briefly following up on some of the ESG and Climate questions already asked today. If I compare your ESG and Climate maybe product portfolio and product ambitions for the next year or two to what you guys had laid out as your road map in your 2021 Investor Day, where have you guys sort of seen the most momentum versus your plan back then? What has maybe been pushed to the back and -- to the back burner? And what has changed since that plan was announced.
Baer Pettit : Well, look, to be honest, I don't have the exact Investor Day presentation in my head, but I have a pretty good sense of what we said. So overall, I think we're very much in line with the broad direction of what we indicated there. I think the element that has to a degree changed is that the distinction between ESG and Climate has become greater than we thought at that time. And the climate agenda has its own specific topics, needs, regulatory framework, et cetera, distinct from ESG. So I would say that increasingly, while there remains, of course, significant overlap between the two, we are, in some regards, viewing them as distinct opportunity. And as we look forward to the next year, I would say that the range of climate solutions is doubtless larger in terms of regulatory needs, whether it be for banks, for asset managers, private company coverage on a kind of on-demand basis. And that doesn't mean in any way that the ESG product pipeline isn't also growing and being enhanced. It's just that I think the role of climate has become even more significant than we expected at that time.
Alexander Hess: Great. Thank you so much, Baer. And then maybe to follow up on the M&A question just asked. If you could maybe dimensionalize where you see opportunities in ESG versus in other parts of the business and to what degree might recent regulations catalyze some desire for consolidation in ESG and Climate overall?
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. So listen, the areas where M&A is most strategic for us in areas where we probably spend most of our time are the areas where we can get access to unique data sets, we can get access to unique capabilities or unique distribution, and so areas like ESG and Climate where data and capabilities are critical differentiators as well as areas like Private Assets are the areas where we spend most of our time. And there are many small players that have developed capabilities or access to datapoints that we believe could be differentiators. And there's a long tail of those players, both on the Private Asset side and on the ESG and Climate side. I'd say the recent regulation is not something that is catalyzing more activity at this stage. To your point, I would say, over time, it will lend market dynamics to probably be a little bit more consolidated and tougher for smaller players to compete. And that potentially creates opportunities. But right now, our focus is on really accelerating our strategic road map. And we think M&A can be an accelerant there, although it doesn't need to be. And we have, as Baer was alluding to, a very rich pipeline of organic initiatives and new product launches on the horizon. M&A can just enhance that, but we're confident even without it.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.
Owen Lau: Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. So I think your market assumption earlier this year was down in the first half and then recover in the second half. But now the market is up quite a bit in the first half. I'm just wondering how much conservatism do you have baked into your full year free cash flow guidance or there's any change in your investment plan for the second half? Any more color would be helpful. Thanks.
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. So I know you know this, Owen, but if you remember in prior quarters, the assumption underlying our guidance was that market levels will drop slightly and then rebound in the back half of the year. Needless to say, to your question, market levels have been running above those assumed levels. And so as a result, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if AUM levels stay at these current levels or increase, we will likely be in the top half of our guidance range on expenses as we recalibrate our spending and level of investment to those higher AUM levels. I don't want to comment too specifically on free cash flow guidance given that there are a wide range of factors that can swing that up and down even beyond business performance. Clearly, business performance and billings are something that help there, but there are a number of other things that can swing it. And so we continue to reiterate our guidance on the free cash flow front. But listen, we continue to monitor the markets and calibrate our pace of spending. And I think it's one of the advantages of our business model is our ability to financially manage through all environments. And if AUMs are higher, we can hopefully capitalize and invest more.
Owen Lau: Got it. And then could you please add more color on the growth driver of your index subscription run rate in the second quarter? And also, it will be great if you can also remind us the growth map of your index subscription run rate, which is how much of it is driven by pricing, new logos and also further penetration. Thanks.
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. As Henry alluded to, the overall index subscription franchise has been quite solid for us. There's not one thing that I would call out driving the performance in the quarter. As we mentioned, we've seen double-digit growth across all module types. We've also seen double-digit growth across all geographic regions, and we've seen growth of 10% or higher across all major client segments. And so the success is broad-based. We did mention that we got a nice benefit from our newly launched free float data product, and that benefited us both on the nonrecurring side but also on the recurring subscription side. I'd say just as Henry alluded to, the overall performance is reflective of this trend of indexation, the growing ecosystem around our indexes and the growing value and utility of our index content in portfolio construction. Just on the algorithm, listen, I would say that the contribution from price within index remains relatively consistent with what I've mentioned in recent quarters. So price is contributing around 40% or so, give or take a bit, to new recurring sales within index. That's a little bit higher than it's been in past years just given we are rolling out higher price increases. In addition to that, the biggest source of new sales for us is selling more to clients. And then the smallest component is new clients for us.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.
Ashish Sabadra : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to focus on the newly announced IFRS sustainability disclosure standards. The question there was how does that change the value proposition going forward. Does it change the competitive environment? And how does it improve the value proposition for ESG ratings?
Baer Pettit : Look, I think the context is one where there are numerous and significant regulatory changes ongoing for ESG. And we view them as significantly positive. So I don't think that there is this particular change that is material. It's the sum of all the changes that are occurring. And certainly, the likelihood that those will continue, including us being regulated which was mentioned earlier, which is a sign of how important regulators consider this topic to be. So going back to the distinction between the Americas and Europe, I think we should discard the political noise and just make the simple statement that, that regulation has not come to the U.S. yet. And so that is more what I would put an emphasis on at the distinction rather than any other topic. So overall, it is the continued regulation, not merely in ESG but also in Climate and across all client types, which is a very significant growth engine for our business.
Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And if I can follow up on the fund launches. Those particularly for ESG has been relatively muted. I was wondering how important new fund launches are for overall revenues. But also there is -- within the ESG, there is a shift from vanilla ESG funds to more of sustainability funds, sustainability-themed funds. And how does that, again, improve the value proposition for MSCI? Thanks.
Baer Pettit : Sure. So just maybe a few observations on this topic. As we alluded to before, and this was particularly at the beginning of the year, and there have been changes in the regulatory environment regarding the classification of fund types 8 and 9. That is not over, but it's, I would say the largest element is likely over. And we're very involved in those discussions both with clients and regulators. So that's what I would call a temporary administrative blip, but again, just to reiterate, in the context of a very positive regulatory environment for us, right? So I think that and then in terms of your observation regarding fund launches, there has been a steady trend for ESG funds to also include a more obvious climate component. And I think we'll continue to see a wide variety of those type of fund launches depending on the client type, the geography, et cetera, and the investment goals of the clients. So I think it's a pretty broad and diversified landscape.
Henry Fernandez: Let me just add something here in this context because oftentimes, the questions we get from shareholders and analysts is how underlying that regulation is a negative for MSCI. It's a huge positive. Now our clients don't love regulations. I mean we don't love -- we would rather operate without regulation than with regulation, but it's a reality of life. And once it comes and once you go make the adjustment, it becomes as a very strong tailwind for us because the clients need a lot more information to comply with the regulatory framework, more granular, more extensive, more this, more that. And secondly, the regulation or not creates incredible competitive advantages because it puts a lot of other people at a disadvantage compared to people like us. So again, we don't go asking people to regulators, and we don't like it when it comes. But after a period of adjustment that we made; it becomes very positive for us.
Operator: We'll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. Can you discuss new recurring subscription sales trends you're seeing for ESG specifically excluding Climate over the past quarter? Has there been stabilization, improvement or a step back? And what are the puts and takes?
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. Yes, I'd say the dynamics are reasonably consistent with what we saw last quarter. We're seeing similar dynamics there. I would say the growth continues to be slower in the Americas relative to EMEA. And in the U.S., we alluded to this earlier, many investors continue to take a more measured pace on how they are integrating ESG, and that is driving some of the longer sales cycles. I'd say U.S. investors and managers are really thinking about how ESG impacts their overall investment objective, how they differentiate themselves relative to competitors, how they market and position themselves externally. And so there is a maturation taking place. And so we continue to see longer sales cycles, most notably in the Americas on the ESG front. But as Henry alluded to, we continue to have a very rich dialogue with them. And the encouraging thing is we have the tools and the services that can help them on that maturation and on that journey.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous.
Kelsey Zhu: Hey, thanks for taking question. So BlackRock has recently talked a lot about the growth opportunities in fixed income ETFs during its Investor Day. I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about your investments there and kind of the revenue potential in the fixed income space.
Baer Pettit : Great. Thank you for that question. So I would just distinguish two things. So clearly, we have partnerships with various fixed income providers, which have been very successful, notably with Bloomberg on ESG. So that's one element. And we really see -- continue to see a lot of upsides in that. Equally, very importantly, we launched not so long ago our own fixed income indexes, where we are looking to create very differentiated products which are either focused on ESG, climate angle and also on more liquid indexes which are more suited for tradable products. So we're in the very early stages of this. And we're as, which is a general MSCI approach. We're feeding some investments, but we're not going over the top. We've got a great pipeline for this year, clearly, from a very, very,- from a modest start, but we're likely exceeded our internal targets. So we really do believe that this is a growth opportunity. And in our case, from a small base, but I think that, hopefully, as we go through the end of this year and start to move into next year, our plan is for it to become something much more material.
Kelsey Zhu: Appreciate that. And then maybe just one more question on ESG. What needs to happen for that new subscription sales growth to reaccelerate again? Is it the macro conditions need to improve? Is it rate cost? Is it the political dynamic needs to stabilize in the U.S.? Just curious to hear your view on this.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So first of all, it is already beginning to accelerate at a small pace in Europe after a period of understanding the regulation, classifying funds, understanding the ingredients that they need in order to market these funds as a sustainable investment funds and all of that, a lot of our European clients are beginning to go beyond that. They're beginning to say, okay, what are we going to do now? What kind of product launches, what kind of differentiation and all of that. And they're beginning to request a lot of different data from us, as I alluded to before. That's not necessarily going to be a ramp up immediately, but it's beginning to preface, hopefully, an increase in sales and the like. Notice also that the high level of retention rates also speaks to the fact that people are not abandoned in this area. So that's in the Europe. In the U.S., I think we may spoke last quarter in which we talked about the political environment because that's what everyone is talking about. But look, does that have some effect or minor effect? Yes, it will because it affects the psychology of people. But a lot more of what is going on in the U.S. is that the global, remember, we play in the global equity markets. We not only play in the U.S. equity market. So the global equity markets in the past were immune. People were concerned about what the effect of the war in Europe and the recession in Europe and China, the opening or lack of opening or whatever. So a lot of our clients were more tightening their budgets with respect to global equity investing. And therefore, ESG is part of that process. ESG is part of global equity investing as well. So we saw a slowdown on that as we begin to see maybe some reopening, better reopening of China, some of the statements about the Chinese government in the last couple of days maybe creates a more forward momentum. We are seeing a lot of momentum in Japan. Europe is obviously stuck a little bit in the economic process there. But hopefully, the markets will get better in Europe as well. I think all of that will then bode well for higher sales of every type to U.S. asset managers as it relates to everything, but ESG in particular. The other thing to keep in mind is that the American asset managers not only manage money for U.S. investors, they manage money for European investors too. So those people need to also be part of the recovery of the demand for sustainable investments in Europe. So we hope to see a recovery from there as well.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you. I wanted to talk about margins. And Andy, I was hoping you could give some perspective on segment level margins. I noticed that while index top line growth was really strong, we didn't see a lot of margin expansion. So curious if there's something as it relates to the new nonrecurring product. Or any other color around investments within index? And then Analytics, margins declined and then ESG margins were up on a year-over-year basis as were Private Assets. So curious on any perspective on any of those segments?
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. I would say I would not overly focus on the margins in any given segment in any period. And more generally, we are not focused heavily on segment margins or the company margin overall. Our primary focus is on driving strong EPS growth. The margin is an input into that, and our pace of spend is an input into that. But overall, we're really focused on driving that attractive EPS growth over time. I would say segment margins are by product of investment opportunities that we have. And so our primary focus is on directing spend to those opportunities, which are going to be the fastest payback, the highest return for us and the most valuable, most strategic for us. And the margin is a byproduct of that. The other factor that feeds into segment margins period-to-period which can cause some fluctuations are allocations. And so we do have a chunk of centralized costs that get allocated to our segments as well as FX. And so for all those reasons, the quarter-to-quarter margins are not something I would focus too much on.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.
Seth Weber: Very good morning. I appreciate the color on AI and generative AI. Maybe can you just touch on whether you see any risks there, disintermediation risks or anything like that? Or do you see this as more of an opportunity for the company? Thank you.
Baer Pettit : Look, we, I think the way I would say it is we definitely view it as an opportunity, and we're never complacent about disintermediation, right? So the opportunity, I think, is twofold. We have an enormous range of very interesting data, which we can make ever more from for our clients, greater insights, more analysis that can feed things like modeling and indexes, et cetera. So I think we're -- so that's a key point. The second thing is precisely related to modeling is that these technologies, the true value added to them is not under or over specifying the modeling in order to get great outputs. And we have an enormous amount of teams and research, et cetera, who are trained in this. And then I think more generally, beyond that, there are big opportunities for us to create efficiencies as well. So the way I would say it is we need to not be complacent. We want to invest, we want to move as fast as we can, and we think that this can give us some competitive advantages. And we're not complacent about people who may be able to start new businesses or create new opportunities to start up some of these items.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Heather Balsky of Bank of America.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to go back to earlier in the call when you spoke about being able to convert some of the nonrecurring index revenues over time. I'm curious if you can talk about sort of how that transition happens, how you're able to convert those revenues and kind of the pace of which you could do so.
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. And maybe I can just broaden it to touch on the nonrecurring revenues, which were quite high in the quarter. I would say we benefited from a very large contribution from onetime license fees related to prior periods. Specific to your question, we did also have a healthy contribution from onetime purchases of our free float data set. Oftentimes, that can broaden the conversation with a client to help them appreciate why some of that data and other unique data sets that we have are going to be integral to their ongoing strategy. And so oftentimes, we will see an initial sale of a data set is a onetime sale and then they want to broaden the use of it, get updated data over time, and that converts into a subscription sale. So it's a helpful feeder for us. I would say nonrecurring revenue is, by its nature quite lumpy, which you've probably seen. We would expect it to revert to levels seen in recent quarters. But we do have a number of areas where there are kind of strong long-term demand dynamics, most notably in areas like over-the-counter derivatives and structured products as well, where we believe there could be healthy demand over time. And those are things that lead to repeat sales and another area where sometimes there can be a switch from more of a nonrecurring type license to a recurring license over time if they become a frequent user for these over-the-counter instruments of our index content. And just along those lines, what we call this, a nonrecurring line, many components of it reflect products and use cases that clients will use repeatedly, which hopefully will create more stability quarter-to-quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.
Craig Huber: Thank you. Obviously, your numbers speak for themselves in a very positive way. But I'm curious, given all your various discussions with clients in Europe and the U.S., has the tone of business with clients from a budget standpoint, from their budget standpoint, do you feel like it's loosening up some here? I mean, obviously, your numbers, your data, your analytical tools are mission-critical, as you talked about earlier and stuff, but are you feeling that budget constraints out there sort of loosening up versus maybe how you were thinking 3 or 6 months ago?
Henry Fernandez: Well, first of all, the budgetary processes of our clients are pretty much set on an annual basis. And they don't remain extremely flexible up and down that much. There will be exceptions that they need to be run all the way to the senior management of our clients. So a lot of the budget for this year was set back in December and January. But we are -- what we are seeing for sure is a slightly more positive tone to the global economy in the case of the U.S., the soft landing; in the case of Europe, that the worst is over and that hopefully, this energy crisis and the war in Ukraine is not going to create more havoc; and in the case of Japan, obviously, that they're trying to inflate the economy in order to grow faster; and obviously, in China, we're still trying to figure out what the government will do there. So but there is that small amount of positivism. That will normally translate into slightly higher sales over time. And the reason is that our clients end up allocating more money to us compared to the growth of their budgets than not. And therefore, they will be able to maybe spend less in other areas and spend more with us because a lot of what we sell them is mission-critical, is cutting-edge. It's something that is on demand immediately from their own clients, et cetera. So compared to a quarter or two ago, yes, in which people were talking maybe a hard landing, people were talking about inflation staying high for a very long period of time, et cetera, there is a little more positivism going on in the world.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Russell Quelch with Redburn.
Russell Quelch: Yes, gents. Appreciate you squeezing me in there. So I appreciate your earlier comments around growth in fixed income indices. S&P have obviously chosen to grow inorganically, acquiring the iBoxx and the CDX indices as part of their IHS market acquisition. So given the step up in the opportunity here as a result of the rise in global yields, might you consider an acquisition to accelerate your growth in fixed income and multi asset indices? Or will you continue to be sort of selective and organic in your approach?
Henry Fernandez: We will always consider an acquisition in the areas that we want to expand at the right price that creates shareholder value. And unfortunately, a lot of other people in our space buy assets, maybe for different reasons. We only buy assets to create shareholder value in the short, medium and long term. So we're very financially disciplined even in areas that are very strategic to us. So we will always consider it at the right prices. We have looked at everything and obviously, there's not a lot out there. So what we have purposely chosen is a path of organic growth in areas that we have significant competitive advantages. So for example, there are a lot of market cap businesses, issuance-weighted indices in the lingo of fixed income, issuance-weighted indices in the world. So we're not going to add a lot of value by deploying our capital to go out and launch of all family of issuance within indices. The area that we're experts on is ESG and is in climate and is in factors. And therefore, we are pushing our capital investment into those areas that we believe we have significant competitive advantages. I believe that, by the way, that fixed income will be one of the early places of most significant repricing of assets and recosting of capital and reallocation of capital with respect to climate, probably more than equities and probably more than other asset classes. And the reason is that the largest players in the fixed income space, the banks and the insurance companies, are going to be under significant regulatory pressure to lower their climate risk in their corporate bond portfolios, in their mortgage portfolios, in their corporate loan portfolios and the like. And they're going to have to add soon and fast, and that's going to lead to a big repricing. So therefore, one of the areas that we're really targeting strongly is the intersection of fixed income and climate, whether it's analytics or whether it's fixed income on climate and indices and the like. So that's an example of places where we see competitive advantage on our part to create value.
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Henry Fernandez, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Well, thank you very much for your time, for your questions. We're available to answer any of your other questions at any time, so reach out to us. We'll be more than happy to share our perspective. Enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-25 08:10:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter 2023. This press release, along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today’s presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today’s call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You will find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We, therefore, caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. We will also discuss organic growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. MSCI delivered solid first quarter results in a challenging external environment, confirming the underlying strength of our franchise and our proactive financial management. We have not been immune to the market turmoil, but our resilience continues to stand out as seen in the headline numbers from the quarter, which include adjusted EPS growth of over 5%, organic subscription run rate growth of 12% and a retention rate of over 95%. On a segment level, we posted our 37th consecutive quarter of double-digit run-rate growth in index recurring subscriptions. We also maintain our momentum in equity portfolio analytics, achieving run rate growth of over 10%. Meanwhile, climate continued to drive a wide range of growth opportunities, including with many emerging client segments, such as banks, wealth managers and insurance companies. MSCI delivered 68% climate run rate growth across our product lines and a climate retention rate of over 96%. The difficult environment has certainly affected buying behavior of our clients. In some areas, client budgets have tightened and sales cycles have lengthened, especially for larger purchases. ESG sales have also been affected by regulatory uncertainty in Europe and by a slowdown among wealth managers and retail investors in the United States, although institutional investor demand remains healthy and steady. As we have noted in recent quarters, our AUM-linked revenue tends to be an early mover in market cycles, while our subscription revenue tends to see a lagging effect. Still, our client engagement levels remains very healthy, and we continue to find a steady demand for our products and services. Even in tough environment, MSCI’s unique competitive advantages endure. Clients need our data, models, analytics and research to navigate a rapidly changing investment landscape. With that in mind, we continue prioritizing core investments in areas we believe we can fuel growth while maintaining very rigorous overall expense discipline. We also recognize the periods of turmoil can spur opportunistic M&A at more attractive valuations than we have seen in prior years, especially as this market cycle persists. We’re actively exploring potential bolt-on acquisitions that could accelerate our strategy. Looking ahead, a key driver of that strategy will be the network effects produced by our One MSCI ecosystem. Our content and IP across product lines are already highly interoperable throughout the investment process. For example, clients can use MSCI tools to design an index-based portfolio, implement ESG or climate overlays on that portfolio and then run analytics on it. All companies at times face short-term wins, yet we continue to see powerful secular tailwinds for MSCI. This is true across product lines, asset classes and client segments. In a bull market, a rising tide can lift all boats. In a bear market, companies like MSCI differentiate themselves. MSCI remains confident that we can use this opportunity, this market cycle to strengthen our client relationships and/or increase our competitive advantages. With that, let me turn the call over to Baer.
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. My comments today will focus on our business results this quarter, what we’re seeing and hearing from clients and how we are continuing to deliver on our dual commitment to our shareholders, namely the execution of our long-term growth agenda to capture more of our addressable markets while maintaining the profitability of the company. We finished March with $1.84 billion of recurring subscription run-rate with an organic growth rate of 12% after closing more than $56 million of new recurring subscription sales during the quarter. It has been a slower environment for closing new sales as you can see from the year-over-year comparisons in our operating metrics, as we continue to see tighter client budgets and longer sales cycles. While we cannot control the macro environment, we maintain our conviction in the mission-critical nature of MSCI’s data models, research and tools. Our sales pipeline and depth of client engagement across products and regions remain steady, and we have some promising larger deals that the teams are working hard to close in the second quarter. Retention rates across the firm are holding up well in the tough environment with both index and ESG and climate reporting over 96% retention and 94% and 92% retention in Analytics and Private Assets, respectively. This is a reflection of the investments we’ve been making not only in our products but also in our client servicing capabilities. I’ll now review a few additional highlights across product lines. In index, we drove 12% organic recurring subscription run rate growth with broad-based strength in both our most well established and emerging client segments and product lines. For example, in market cap-weighted index modules, our subscription run rate is now almost $600 million, and it grew 11% during the quarter. Investors are still turning to our market cap indexes to understand their global investment opportunity set across sectors, styles, sizes and geographies to implement rules-based strategies. They are also using our indexes to implement customized strategies and to express an investment thesis. Our custom and specialized index modules are now $108 million of our subscription run rate and grew 13% during the quarter. Our index subscription run rate with asset managers expanded by over 10% this quarter including from areas where we have existing strength such as our core market cap index modules. Our subscription run rate with wealth managers has expanded by 23% year-over-year, supported by the licensing of our custom indexes for model portfolios and direct indexing use cases. In Analytics, we drove 6% subscription run rate growth, excluding FX. New recurring subscription sales were almost $14 million during the quarter, roughly level with our performance in the same period last year. The current environment emphasizes the mission-critical nature of our analytics capabilities for institutional investors, and we’re able to close several new strategic sales for both our equity risk models and enterprise risk and performance tools. Specifically, in equity portfolio management, we closed nearly $6 million of new recurring sales driven by equity risk model sales to hedge funds who use our models and tools to actively position their portfolios to benefit from volatility and market dislocation while also managing downside risk. During the recent period of market instability, our clients relied heavily on our analytics, models, research and tools, significantly increasing their usage on our platforms, helping them to better understand potential risks and associated exposures within their portfolios. Stress testing, factor performance, liquidity risk and counterparty risk all remain in the spotlight as clients try to assess and manage their counterparty and market-risk exposure according to potential swings in market sentiment. Across all product lines, our ESG and climate run rate is now $453 million, which grew 20% year-over-year. Our firm-wide climate run rate is now $84 million, which grew 68% and continues to be one of the most attractive growth engines for us. We continue to launch new tools for our clients to better equip them to understand and manage climate risks and opportunities in the context of their investment portfolios. In the past quarter, we have introduced biodiversity screens and insights as well as multi-horizon climate probability of default. Additionally, to keep pace with the growing number of public and private assets our clients are invested in, we expanded both our asset location database and the coverage universe of our implied temperature rise network which helps financial institutions incorporation set and meet climate targets. We believe our continued investments will help clients effectively navigate the evolving regulatory requirements impacting them, which will be a long-term catalyst for growth. However, in the short term, some clients are slowing down buying decisions in order to better understand new proposed or potential regulations. As we have previously stated, we are preserving investment capacity to secure new growth. Our intention is to preserve as much investment as possible in key areas aligned with client demand and where we believe we can deliver attractive returns, such as climate, ESG, client design indexes, fixed income and the ongoing modernization of the client experience. In parallel, we are equally focused on creating greater efficiencies across the company to allow us to fund these important investments. As I stated at the outset, we will continue to deliver on our dual commitment to shareholders, which means executing on our long-term growth agenda while maintaining the profitability of the company. With that, I will turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer and hi everyone. The financial results in the quarter showcase the attractiveness of our financial model and the effectiveness of our actions. Subscription revenue, which is 75% of total revenue, remained steady with 13% organic growth while we continue to feel the pressure from year-over-year declines in AUM-related revenue with ABF revenue down 8%. While the first quarter tends to be seasonally lower for new sales. Our results in the quarter were softer than last year, reflecting several factors. Relative to a year ago, we saw some lengthening of sales cycles and fewer larger ticket deals. These dynamics were particularly pronounced in the Americas and within our ESG and climate segment. In ESG and climate, the impact of macro pressures and constrained client budgets had a more pronounced impact where the details of pending or recently released regulations have not been fully clarified or interpreted and where there is likely a higher level of more discretionary purchases in certain use cases. Additionally, in some areas of the firm, we saw a modest decline in retention, most notably coming from smaller hedge funds, broker dealers and real estate brokers and developers, although importantly, firm-wide retention rates remain fairly strong overall and in line with historical averages. While the longer term demand and pipeline remain steady, we expect some of these cyclical ESG dynamics to persist in the short-term. But overall, we continue to operate from a position of strength with strong momentum and healthy client engagement across our subscription base. In index, subscription run rate growth was 12% in the quarter. Client demand for active and passive index strategies remained healthy. We again saw notable strength within our market cap modules as clients continue to integrate indexes more heavily into their investment processes, and we continue to benefit from a growing trading ecosystem. Since the end of December, AUM balances and MSCI-linked ETFs have rebounded by over $82 billion, including over $7 billion of cash inflows, which helped asset-based fees improved by 6% since year-end. We saw strong flows into both developed markets outside the U.S. and emerging market funds, both areas where ETFs based on MSCI indexes had strong market share capture. Recently, one of our clients completed the largest ETF launch in history based on AUM, which is linked to MSCI’s Climate Action indexes. Traded volumes of listed futures and options linked to MSCI indexes remained slightly elevated but saw some normalization relative to the high market volatility environment last year. Within those cyclical dynamics, we continue to see the secular build of volumes resulting from the growing liquidity and trading ecosystem around financial products linked to our indexes, and the growing volumes of listed futures and options have helped drive growth in the broader index derivatives franchise. We continue to see healthy client appetite for structured products and OTC derivatives linked to MSCI indexes as well as strong demand from trading firms and hedge funds for our index data. These areas help to support both recurring and onetime sales volumes. In Analytics, subscription run rate growth was 6%, excluding FX. We continue to see strong demand from the buy side for our equity risk models and our broader equity portfolio management tools. Despite some of the previously mentioned pressures, the mission-critical nature of our analytics tools in these environments continues to provide a path of steady growth. In our ESG and climate segment, we saw overall organic subscription run rate growth of 30% with growth in EMEA at 34%, while growth in the Americas slowed to 24%. Coinciding with the slowdown in new ESG fund launches in the region and some slowdown in client buying decisions related to the previously mentioned factors. In climate, we continue to see good momentum and very engaging discussions across client segments, although some of the factors impacting ESG sales did, to a smaller degree, also impact climate sales. Our climate subscription run rate growth across all products was 68%, which was roughly the same as the Climate ABF growth rate. In real assets, we continued to deliver double-digit organic subscription run rate growth of 10%. We see strong engagement from our clients as they look for insights into the highly dynamic market, including around climate and income risk, although we did see some pickup in cancels from smaller clients in the quarter. I’ll now go over the puts and takes of our 5% growth in adjusted EPS in the first quarter. While asset-based fees were lower than last year, growth in subscription revenues was a significant driver of the $0.16 adjusted EPS expansion year-on-year. The lower share count drove $0.07 of the year-over-year increase, benefiting from the significant level of opportunistic share repurchases we executed last year. I would note that our Q1 adjusted EBITDA expenses of $247 million included about $22 million of seasonally higher compensation and benefits-related expenses that we had anticipated and indicated to you previously, although we did have some comp-related accruals and non-comp items that were slightly more favorable than expected. We remain well capitalized and ended March with a cash balance of nearly $1.1 billion. On client collections, we continue to see slightly longer payment cycles consistent with our prior comments due in part, we believe, to the opportunity cost of a high-rate environment. There were no share repurchases during the quarter, although we continue to be poised for and actively focused on attractive repurchase and potentially compelling bolt-on M&A opportunities. We continue to believe this environment could result in some repricing and/or unlocking of previously unavailable acquisition opportunities. Lastly, I would like to turn to our 2023 guidance. Our guidance ranges across all categories remain unchanged. It is important to note that we have based our guidance on the assumption that ETF AUM balances declined slightly from current levels in the second quarter and gradually rebound in the second half of the year. While the environment may result in some caution from clients in the next quarter or two, we have the financial model and the proactive management levers to drive investment in the very compelling long-term growth opportunities while delivering very attractive financial performance. We remain encouraged by the strong client engagement across numerous growth opportunities, and we continue to be closely aligned with the long-term trends transforming the investment industry. We look forward to keeping you all posted on our progress. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to just talk about the ESG slowdown specifically, I mean, is the comments around the regulatory delay, is that just people waiting. I just want to understand why that would impact whether they needed the data that you guys have or not. And then just hoping you could just break out the strong growth rates in ESG, like how much of that is new sales versus cross-selling or upselling and pricing, just to help understand which part of that dynamic is being impacted the most?
Henry Fernandez: Manav, thank you for the question. First of all, let me just level set a little bit. As Andy indicated, ESG and climate, the – we had a 30% run rate growth in the segment per se with 34% in EMEA, over 20-plus percent in the Americas. And we had a 21% run rate growth firm-wide in ESG and climate despite the lower AUM-linked revenues that we have had given the decline in equity values around the world. So in any environment, these are not too shabby numbers to begin with, they’re definitely lower than the recent past, but not bad at all. So we’re very pleased about that. The second point that I will make before I go directly to your answer, Manav, is that we’re very excited about a number of new products that we’re launching in ESG and climate. First of all, we are continuing our ESG rating coverage expansion into more equities and more fixed income and other private assets that will bode well for additional sales. We’re very excited about the uptake on the total portfolio, carbon footprinting service that we’re offering, which includes public and private assets and includes corporate bonds, for example, for banks. We have launched a European bank regulatory product in which – for climate risk. So that’s important. We’re launching a biodiversity set of data and products with a partnership with the firm. On climate risk, we’re very excited about the Climate Lab Enterprise. In addition to the climate probability of default, we believe that climate risk will be a major driver of risk analytics in the future and the like. So now, there is a lot that we can say about that. So now in direct answer to your question on the slowdown, there are two components – there are two major regions where our ESG and climate sales are happening is clearly the Americas and EMEA. And the Americas, especially in the U.S., we have seen a meaningful slowdown in sales due to some of the geopolitical issues and political involved discussions that are going on about ESG. And the institutions that we deal with, they are all continuing to subscribe to the product line and they are continuing to integrate ESG and climate into their portfolios. They are trying to stay low key so that they don’t get in the crossfire of the political system. And what we have seen is definitely a slowdown in retail demand, wealth managers, mutual fund launches and the like because a lot of the asset managers, again, are trying to assess the whole political landscape and being cautious not to get caught in the middle of that. We believe that, that’s going to persist maybe for a year or more, given the elections coming up. But at some point, it’s going to have to revive because ESG and climate are an integral part of the investment universe. In EMEA, our sales have held up pretty steady from prior quarters, no meaningful reduction in sales. But obviously, in EMEA, the regulators have come up with a new system as to what is an ESG fund and what is not. So similarly to what I was saying in the Americas, the institutional demand remains pretty steady and very robust. The retail demand is going through a little bit of an adjustment as to what is an article 9 fund, what is an article 8 fund. So our clients are sort of – sorting out how their product lines up to a lot of that. And we believe that once they finish that process, they are going to start launching ESG and climate funds because the fundamental demand in EMEA continues to be very strong. So in a nutshell, we continue very excited about this segment. The growth has slowed down a little bit in addition to because of the cautionary budget that exists in the world plus these other things, the political situation in the U.S. and the regulatory situation in EMEA. But the fundamental demand is there. This is a product that is here to stay especially the – in all aspects, actually, the integration and the impact investing and all of that. And it’s just a question of when we begin to see a return to higher growth rates.
Andy Wiechmann: And Manav, just very quickly on the composition of new recurring sales to your question, the strong majority of new recurring sales continue to come from the new clients and new services or upselling our existing clients. I’d say, the breakdown between those is roughly even. So roughly even contribution from new clients and new services. I would highlight price is contributing a slightly higher percentage than what we’ve seen in the past to new sales?
Manav Patnaik: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you. Just on the M&A, I think you guys mentioned it a few times in terms of the valuations coming down and exploring bolt-ons. I was hoping you could just elaborate a bit more on that. It sounds like it would be a series of small to midsize tuck-ins and in the obvious areas of ESG and data and so forth? Or just hoping that you could give a little bit more color there.
Henry Fernandez: So as we said, Manav, these are all smaller bolt-on acquisitions. There is nothing sizable or transformational that we can see on the horizon that obviously can change at any point, but we don’t see that happening. So we have been – as you have seen, as we’ve been relatively muted in our acquisition past in the last few years because we’re very disciplined buyers. Even if an asset is very strategic, it has to have financial underpinning stores. It has to make sense financially. We saw a lot of our competitors bidding up assets to levels that we would not want to participate in, in the past. So we’re waiting to see if this environment brings down those valuations that make a lot more sense and obviously only in the strategic areas that we’re interested in. So that’s why we wanted to emphasize that and especially in the context of the lack of repurchases because we don’t have a huge amount of cash, and we have wanted to preserve cash for these opportunities when and if they come.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Just wanted to follow-up on ESG questions. I guess I definitely understand what you just mentioned on political environment and retail, etcetera. I guess do you see ESG getting worse before it gets better? Or is – should we just expect sort of a maybe modest environment for the next year?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you for that, Toni. First of all, let me just reiterate that our ESG franchise is very diversified – ESG and climate franchise is very diversified across regions, across types of customers that – what we call client segments, whether it’s an institution – an institutional investor manager managing institution of money versus a manager managing individual or wealth money across banks and across, as I said, regions of the world, and use cases. So this is very varied and the like. So what I want to make sure we all recognize is that the U.S. marketplace is a clearly important one. But within the U.S. marketplace, you’ve got to break it down into what is going on with the – with managers who are managing retail money versus people who are managing institutional money versus the banks who have a different driver versus the hedge funds and all of that. So therefore, it’s a lot of different areas that we need to look at. My sense – our sense at MSCI is that the area of the market that it is asset managers managing mutual fund money or ETF money or wealth money is going to stay subdued and for a couple of reasons. One, the client segment, half of them are blue and half of them are red and some of them are going to have different views as to what this product line should be. Secondly, a lot of asset managers are trying to stay below the radar screen of a lot of these political wins. They don’t want to be attacked, so they don’t want to be making a lot of fanfare about new products, they are launches – launching, etcetera. So in the U.S., it’s going to stay a little bit subdued on that segment of the market, but it will not be on the institutional market, and it will not be on climate for banks, for example, climate risk for banks and others. In EMEA, I think this process of reclassifying funds and reordering things, it’s going to – still may take a few months, a few quarters, and then the demand will pick up again in the context, obviously, of a total operating environment. And when we’re beginning to see a lot of traction in Asia in all client segments and that is virgin territory for us.
Toni Kaplan: Great. Very helpful. I wanted to also ask just in this sort of current environment, how you’re thinking about investment in ESG products. So I know long-term view as the trends are positive but I guess in maybe near-term, do you shift your investment towards other areas or have you been shifting your investment towards other areas just in light of what’s been going on? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Hi, Toni, Baer here. So look, maybe just using a slightly different tone, I can’t control myself. Look, ESG and climate still grew 30% in this quarter, right? That’s a very attractive growth rate, and for sure, if we can sustain that sort of growth rate on the run rate we have, that remains a very significant opportunity and adding the – that amount in dollars in run rate every quarter, for sure, will continue to require a lot of investment. And as Henry has pointed out, we have continuous demand across a variety of client segments, geographies, etcetera. So there certainly isn’t anything between this quarter and the last which changes our view that this is a structurally important opportunity, right? So we have to balance it with the environment. And Henry alluded to certain strains, if you want to call it that. But certainly, from our perspective, this is a growth opportunity. It is structurally so and we have a lot of client demand for continued data and improvements in the product line.
Henry Fernandez: Let me just add something else here, and that is ESG and climate is one category that we use. Within that category, you also have to look at the ESG component, which obviously has climate – a part of that is climate. So you have to look at the climate tools themselves on a stand-alone basis, and we’ve been able to – we began to create more disclosures about that for all of you. So on the climate side, the run rate grew 68% to about $84 million, $85 million in run-rate. We believe that in the next few years and probably the next 5 to 10 years, climate is going to be the biggest opportunity that all of us are going to be faced with the whole world needs to figure out – the whole world of the capital markets, the investment industry and the finance and insurance industry will need to deal with climate risk in their portfolio, decarbonization of their portfolios and the like. So we continue to make a steady investment in that area because we want to be one of the undisputed leaders on climate and the consequent growth that we can see in value creation.
Toni Kaplan: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to talk about the sales environment in particular, what happened in the first quarter. Clearly, the second half of March got very volatile with some of the bank issues. So knowing salespeople, I know sometimes those sales can happen right at the end of the quarter. So just wondering if that was a big headwind at the time, if you actually think some of the 1Q opportunities got pushed into the second quarter or if somewhat you just saw at the end of the first quarter, actually, is just a look at what may be to come and things actually get worse from here near-term on the sales side.
Henry Fernandez: Definitely, Alex, you’re absolutely right. The – a lot of stress in the system happens in the last 2 weeks of a quarter in terms of clients and making budgetary decisions, and we’re trying to close on sales. And the banking scare and the banking crisis took place around that time. There probably was some smaller impact in delaying some sales at that time, but it wasn’t anything that we spend a lot of time on. So that tells you that within sort of that as pretty serious to the closing of the sales in the quarter. And the banking crisis per se, it doesn’t have a huge direct effect on us because it has been concentrated in some of the smaller banks, obviously, with the exception of Credit Suisse, which was already in difficulties. The bigger banks, which are our clients are extremely well capitalized, they are extremely regulated, so we’re not as concerned about them. But I think the overall banking crisis does add to the stress in the overall financial system. It adds to uncertainty. It will add to cautiousness and a little bit of risk aversion. So that’s likely to add one more variable to the environment that we have depicted here. We remain pretty – with respect to our pipeline and sales, it remains pretty solid. It remains pretty healthy with a caveat that the larger deals have slowed down what we call the big-ticket items have slowed down. Secondly, the sales cycles are longer and maybe there is a little bit of pickup in cancellations. But we’re not looking into the near future and thinking that we have a big problem coming our way.
Alex Kramm: Okay. Great. And then secondarily, you made some comments about still very focused on profitability and growing profitability. I think over the last few months, I’ve heard you speak a little bit more when it comes to profitability in terms of EPS, earnings per share, and not as much on margins or EBITDA margin. So just curious, when it comes to EBITDA margin, which a lot of us care about, are you still very committed when you talk about profitability on growing core margins? Or are you thinking more holistically? Or what’s your latest thinking about profitability?
Henry Fernandez: That’s a great question because, as you know, I’m a large shareholder in MSCI. So when I look at myself as a shareholder, at the end, what I care is about the long-term growth of the adjusted EPS. And that’s what’s going to – if we have very healthy growth of adjusted EPS over years and years, with healthy top line and healthy sort of EBITDA margins and the like, the market will reward us with good multiples and good valuation. So we’re beginning to focus a lot more on that, but it’s not at the exclusion of clearly top line growth. It’s not at the exclusion of our EBITDA and our EBITDA margin. It’s just a little bit of a mixing of the variables. The problem in the past for us has been that we were so focused and so obsessed with EBITDA and EBITDA margin that at times when elected the EPS growth is not a big company, so I thought I was wrong because our shareholders that’s what they eat. They eat EPS growth. That’s what they value the company on the basis of that. Obviously, there are a lot of other things that make up that, but that’s a little bit of the – it’s not an exclusion. It’s just a pivoting of emphasis.
Alex Kramm: Thank you. Thanks for clarifying me.
Operator: The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Baer, in your prepared remarks, I believe you mentioned there are some promising larger deals that the teams are currently working on to close in the second quarter. I was wondering if you could just provide some more color on those deals, which are the uncertain end markets. Is it focused more on index analytics or ESG? Any color on those fronts? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Sure. No, look, I think it’s the normal mix, Ashish. I don’t think that there is any particular color to it. There is some important stuff we have, for sure, in Analytics. We have some large ESG deals and index. So the point was more to make a broader observation and picking up from Henry’s observations that we haven’t seen a decline in our pipeline. We’ve got – we had a few things referencing the larger deals that had a slightly longer sales cycle than we thought, and again, referencing also Alex’s question. So it was more of a general observation just to say we’ve got some – we’ve got a healthy pipeline going into the next quarter. And we’re very focused on trying to close.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful color. And maybe just a quick follow-up. As we think about the sales slowdown on the subscription growth, obviously, subscription growth has been really robust 12% despite the macro challenges, but how should we think about some of these sales slowdown headwind on subscription growth. But on the other side, we also have ABF improving as the AUM fund flows improve. So any puts and takes on the top line as we think about going forward? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. Ashish – and Henry alluded to this in his prepared remarks. We have this nice balance in our top line, where the ABF revenue tends to lead a cycle and the subscription revenue tends to be impacted on a lagging basis. I don’t want to overemphasize that we might be seeing some lagging impacts on the subscription base right now, but there probably are some impacting it, although it’s important to underscore that our retention rates remain quite healthy, in line with historical averages here, particularly in index and analytics, and ESG is even 96% plus. And it is quite a diverse book of business. And the two biggest pieces of it, index and analytics, are actually remaining quite strong here. And the outlook is okay on those fronts. And so in the short-term, there could continue to be some impacts on operating metrics, which impacts the subscription growth. But I’d say, overall, we’ve got quite a resilient franchise. And to your point about asset-based fees, to the extent the market starts to recover and has a sustained recovery, that just adds to some of the momentum we have in the business and the resilience we have in the business. I would underscore, as I mentioned in the guidance comments that we have a cautious outlook in the short-term. So our guidance is based on the assumption that ETF AUMs declined in the second quarter and then rebound gradually in the back half of the year. But any upside there is obviously beneficial to us and creates capacity for us to invest more.
Ashish Sabadra: Very helpful color. Thanks, Andy.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Hess with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Alexander Hess: Hi, good morning, all. I just want to touch again on the retention rate briefly, 95.2%. I believe that was up somewhat from 4Q. Can you comment maybe how much of that sequential quarter-on-quarter improvement was driven by any sort of improvements or changes in the client environment? Or was that just seasonal factors there?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I would say the seasonal aspects do play a meaningful role. Given that we have the largest portion of renewals taking place in the fourth quarter, retention rates tend to drop a bit there. So I wouldn’t read too much into the sequential dynamics. As I just mentioned, we are encouraged that the overall retentions are in line – overall retention rate is in line with historical averages. And so, we’ve just seen some pullback from the high levels we saw a year ago. But overall, they are in a pretty good position. And as Baer mentioned, really where we are seeing the pickup in cancels is in ESG and climate and real assets. And from a client standpoint, it’s really showing up with smaller clients and within areas like broker-dealers and banks, hedge funds, real estate agents and developers. So it’s kind of around the edges and some of the structural stuff and client events that we would typically see in these types of environments.
Alexander Hess: Thanks, Andy. And maybe as a follow-up, you briefly mentioned real assets. Just wanted to maybe get an update on anything that’s gone on there with the Burgiss group with RCA. We’re a couple of years out now from some pretty large spend on those areas. It would just be nice to get an update on traction in the market and anything else you can maybe provide us with on those businesses.
Baer Pettit: Sure, I’ll make a few comments. So first of all, if we look at the overwhelming run rate is in real estate, just clearly been a very challenging environment across the globe. In view of that, we were pretty pleased actually to have an 8% run rate growth or 10% ex FX. So for example, transaction volumes in the U.S., which is clearly critical for us in that part of the market have been down 70%. And some of our other important markets from like the UK have been hit very hard but we’ve had actually really decent retention rate there. So I think allowing for the very challenging environment, we’re pretty happy with the results. And we will have to see – there is certainly sometimes a little bit of a lag from, let’s say, the REIT’s repricing to other private markets. We could still be in a choppy environment for real estate for some time. But in view of that, I think the resilience of our franchise is pretty strong and people need our data and analytics precisely to understand the performance and risk in these changing markets. So that’s that. And I think on Burgiss, we don’t really have anything to add from the last quarter. So I think that those are my summary comments, right.
Alexander Hess: Thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Owen Lau: Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. So broadly speaking, how does the reopening of China and the comeback of some Chinese stocks impact AUM and the flow of MSCI-linked index in the Asia Pacific region? And then, maybe could you also please talk about or give us an update on the opportunity in the Asia Pacific region and how MSCI would approach these opportunities? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Owen. The – clearly, the opening of China from loan protractive COVID lockdown is positive for our business in all of Asia, not only in China, but all of Asia because, as you know, China has a meaningful economic and additive impact in the balance of the countries in Asia. So that’s been very positive. Despite the fact that the lockdown, we don’t even see clients in Mainland China. I mean it was really, really draconic as you all know. We have been managing to grow our MSCI China. We have been able to grow the business both in Mainland China and on a run-rate growth basis, about 9%, 10% in this quarter compared to last year. So that’s a positive. Now, we have to – so China itself, Mainland China is a very small, almost non-material run rate for us. The assets that are linked to – directly to MSCI China indices are not significant. Obviously, the big effect is the part of the emerging market index that is made up of China, and the recovery there is going to bode well for the overall emerging market index and the assets associated with that emerging market index, so that’s going to be a positive for us. So, that’s a little bit of the breakdown of the various components. So, we are very optimistic that the recovery in China, the asset, the equity values increasing in China and the opening up of the country will have overall positive effects for our business. But as I have said, it’s not a huge base, except with the – except for the part of MSCI China that is in the emerging market index.
Andy Wiechmann: And just to put a finer point on the ETF flows. We did see pretty healthy flows into international markets, both developed markets outside the U.S., but to Henry’s point, also into EM exposure. And those are two areas where we had nice market share capture. On the EM flows, we actually captured about 60% of new flows into emerging market ETF. And clearly, China is a big component of that.
Owen Lau: Got it. That’s very helpful. And then can I go back to the guidance for a little bit. And I think Andy, you mentioned that you assume that ETF would decline slightly in the second quarter and then rebound in the second half. But I remember previously, you mentioned that the market would decline in the first half of this year. I am just wondering is there any change in assumptions here? And then I think broadly speaking, what does it take for MSCI to kind of like dial up or dial down the free cash flow guidance for this year if, let’s say, the market stay at current level? Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. I would say, overall we continue to have a cautious outlook in the near-term, which you can see by the ETF AUM assumption that’s underlying our guidance. Just to reiterate what you alluded to, we are assuming the markets’ decline from the current levels during the second quarter here and then rebound gradually in the second half of the year. Just to your question about what it would take for us to dial up or dial down, I would say it’s a constant calibration. It’s something we are actively focused on. Although the markets performed better during the first quarter than the assumption we had outlined in our original guidance at the beginning of the year, we still continue to have a cautious outlook in the near-term. And so, we are being cautious on expenses and the pace of hiring where we are being a little bit more measured. And we continue to be disciplined on the non-comp expense front to ensure we are able to invest in those critical growth areas and attractive long-term opportunities. We do have, I would say, further levers on the downside if we need to, and we can further slow or even stop headcount growth, and we can further tighten non-comp on the downside. But importantly, to your question, if we do see a sustained improvement in the markets, we are ready to accelerate investment and spend. And so, it would be really a calibration and a determination that we see that sustained momentum in the markets and confidence that we are recovering here. And if we see that, then I think you could see us dial up the pace of spend. And I don’t want to comment specifically on what that would mean for free cash flow. There is a lot of puts and takes there, but I would say all the guidance is a reflection of the outlook that we have, and we have currently got a cautious outlook.
Owen Lau: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to drill down further into the selling environment. You talked about being tighter client budgets, longer sales cycles. Outside of ESG, can you elaborate on where in the business you are seeing the most impact from that and how client sentiment has trended exiting the quarter?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, sure. So, listen, the way it manifests itself, and I am just underscoring points that we have made because I am trying to stick to what we are seeing here, which is fewer large ticket deals, lengthening of sales cycles and elevated cancels, particularly among smaller clients and particularly in just ESG and real estate. Those impacts are most pronounced in those two segments where I think there are some segment-specific factors. Henry outlined some of the factors impacting ESG, and Baer talked about some of the factors impacting real estate. I do want to underscore that index and analytics see some of those dynamics to a small degree, but are generally holding up okay. And there continue to be a number of large and key areas, not only in index and analytics, but also in ESG and real estate, where we continue to see strong momentum. And many of those are the core aspects of those parts of the business. Geographically, the dynamics were most notable in the Americas, but I would say that was heavily driven by the impact in ESG and climate. But overall, pipeline is steady, as Baer said, and we do expect some of these dynamics to continue in the short-term. But I think we see the indications that the engagement with clients on these big secular trends continues to be quite healthy.
George Tong: Got it. That’s helpful. And then you talked a little bit about the analytics business holding up relatively well. Organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, it is a bit below the long-term target of high-single digit growth. Do you expect the growth there to accelerate over the course of the year? Do you expect it to stay where it is? And what are some of the puts and takes of underlying trends you are seeing in the analytics business?
Baer Pettit: Yes. So, look, I don’t think there is a dramatic change. We had a few large deals that didn’t quite make it this quarter. We didn’t do quite as well as we would have liked in fixed income this quarter. But actually, we have got a really good pipeline there and that business is going from strength-to-strength and so it’s a little bit of a mixed bag. So, I don’t think we don’t see anything dramatic. We would like to do a little better than we did this quarter for sure. We have got a decent pipeline, including some of the larger deals that I alluded to in my earlier comments to Owen, I think it was. So, I think overall, we are working the pipeline. We would like to see the growth a bit higher than it is here, but we don’t expect anything dramatic from where we are right now.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you. So Andy, I wanted to just put a final point on expenses and investments. You mentioned some favorability this quarter. And I know you have maintained your expense guide, but you have talked about being measured also and that there are further downside levers and upside levers. So curious, has anything changed over the last few months as it relates to your investment spending relative to the expenses that you are incurring and how you are viewing that for the rest of the year?
Andy Wiechmann: No, nothing too significantly. As I said, we did a roll forward of the ETF AUM assumptions that underlie our guidance at the beginning of the year to where we are now. Clearly, the markets performed a bit better in the first quarter than we had baked into the original guidance, but we continue to have this cautious outlook and assume that the markets will pull back a little bit here in the short-term and then rebound in the back half of the year. And so, I would say, the overall view on expenses and pace of spend is generally consistent with where we started the year. I would say we continue to have that degree of caution here, and we have moderated the pace of headcount growth, although you probably saw we continue to grow, and that’s in the key areas, the key growth areas for the firm.
Henry Fernandez: Let me just add something because we keep – we have referred a number of times to our outlook in terms of asset values, equity asset values. And I want all of you to understand that there is no magic. We don’t have significantly better insights than you have about what could happen to equity values in the foreseeable future. The emphasis on this is that we manage our expense base, is that we manage our investment plan. And therefore, when we say we are predicting the following, it’s in order to give you a sense of what is our mindset in order to manage our expenses and our investment plan. We want to be in a position that if we get positively surprised that the equity values are higher than we thought they would be, we can rapidly do an upturn playbook and invest more. But what we don’t want to be is going into a difficult environment with a bloated expense base and having to radically alter our expenses and our investments and the like. So, that’s a little bit of the mindset of what we are trying to do here. But there is no – we don’t have any major insights that the market will go down in the second quarter or the third quarter. We just use this as a mechanism to manage our expense base.
Faiza Alwy: Understood. Thank you for that. And then just a follow-up on the climate side, you mentioned obviously slowing new sales on the ESG and climate segment, then you mentioned the political environment in the U.S. and some regulatory uncertainty in Europe. It sounded to me – my takeaway is that that’s more on the ESG side as opposed to the climate side. But curious if that’s the right takeaway and any further color you might have on that.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So, that’s a good question. First of all, you also have to look at the ESG and climate sales in the context of an overall caution environment or cautious environment of spending by our clients all over the world because they are – they don’t know the direction of equity values or financial markets. They don’t know yet when interest rates are going to start peaking, what the level of potential slowdown or rotation may be etcetera, etcetera, right. So therefore, any product line will have to take into account that the overall spending of clients is more cautious now than it has been in the last 12 months or so. So, secondly, with respect to ESG and climate, yes, a lot of the – some of the political issues in the U.S. are referred to as ESG. But when you really hear the politicians, sometimes they are referring to social issues in ESG, and sometimes they are referring to oil and gas or climate risk issues and the likes of that. So, the caution about the U.S. market, even though you hear it as ESG alone, it varies. If you go to Florida, a lot of it is about social and the ESG. If you go to Texas, a lot of it is about the environmental part or the climate part of ESG. So, we think that the institutional demand will increase on climate in the U.S. and across the board, but the individual retail demand may be a little bit slower. In Europe, climate is – the climate tools are in demand all over the place because Europe, as we all know, is a leader in trying to figure out how to decarbonize their economies, how to increase renewable efforts. And they are pushing the asset managers to take climate into account. So, 68%, 70% growth rate on climate is not bad. It slowed down clearly from a year ago, but we are very, very optimistic about the prospects of climate tools in the world for us.
Faiza Alwy: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Craig Huber: Great. Thank you. On the climate front, can you just tell us quickly, if you would, what data and what analytical tools, you guys think you have in climate that really sets you guys apart from your peers out there? And obviously, you talk about long-term. You think your climate run rate will eventually get larger than the rest of ESG. So, what really makes you stand out from a data standpoint and tools from climate?
Baer Pettit: Yes. So, I think there is a variety of things. And of course, we would be very happy to also take this offline because it’s a longer discussion. But fundamentally, it’s the breadth and depth. It’s what we cover in terms of climate – companies, excuse me and securities. It’s our modeling of climate, including some of our more sophisticated indicators like implied temperature change. And in physical risks, the competitive landscape is such that it’s a little checker depending on what part of the market you are in. But those are some of the highlights. But it’s obviously – it’s a large question, which we would be very happy to spend more time with you offline.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. And Craig, if you don’t mind, I just want to underscore one point, which I think you know, but it is really an important differentiator for us. That be $4 million [ph] of climate run rate cuts across all product segments for us. And so the ability to offer solutions across almost every part of the investment process really differentiates us from other providers out there. So clearly, index is a big part of it, which I know you are aware, but our leadership in index is more generally. And our leadership in climate caused us to be a leader there. Our ability to provide climate risk insights across analytics where we have the clients’ portfolios, we are helping them with risk already really give us a leg up on anyone else trying to do climate risk at a portfolio or an enterprise level. And then in areas like private assets, just given our capabilities and unique data we have on that front gives us a real leg up. So, the total franchise that we have is a real competitive advantage that I want to make sure people don’t lose sight of.
Craig Huber: Thank you for that. My second question, you obviously kept your cost guidance unchanged here. Often, companies when they go into a much tougher – what they think is a tougher environment, will cut their cost base significantly. I am curious, given your added cautionary comments right now, you did not though cut cost outlook for the year. Was it – is the environment basically how you were thinking it was, say, three months when you put out your initial guidance because again, you did not trim your cost outlook?
Henry Fernandez: Okay. I think we are extremely comfortable with our cost base, our expense base, which we divided up into running the business expenses on what we call change the business expenses, which is the more pure investment plan. We have preserved in the last few quarters the vast majority of our investment plan. And we have done that by squeezing around the business expenses in a variety of ways to free up resources, okay. So, we are very, very comfortable. We believe we have scaled the expense base of the company to the operating environment, to the cautious operating environment that exists today, even with a lower operating environment that exists today. In the event that it dramatically moves down, we have a lot of levers that we can apply. But if anything, we believe that the probability of us triggering an upturn playbook is probably higher than downturn playbook, but we don’t know. I mean obviously, we have to see what happens in the next few quarters. So, we are extremely comfortable. The other thing to remind everyone is that MSCI is a very diversified client base – a diversified franchise. We tend to not focus on that. It’s diversified about client segments from asset owners, to asset managers to – from wealth managers and banks and insurance companies on our corporates and hedge funds and banks, the regions of the world. We are doing well in EMEA right now, relatively well in EMEA, to the Americas, to the Asia-Pacific region. The product lines and public assets, equity and now fixed income and private assets and ESG and climate has overlaid to all of what we do. We have a lot of performance tools. We have a lot of risk tools. We have different forms of pricing whether it’s subscription, whether it’s AUM, whether it’s transaction and then volumes like in futures and options. We have a very diversified employee base. 65% of our employees are spread a lot, half of them [ph] are so big emerging markets of the world, 35% are in developed markets. So, whenever there is an issue of labor tightness or increases in expenses and wages in a particular location, we hire in other locations. We have a lot of hedges between dollar versus non-dollar and the like. So, that’s why we are very comfortable with this expense base because of the nature of the franchise that is diversified and the nature of our cautiousness going into the market.
Craig Huber: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.
Russell Quelch: Yes. Thanks having me on. And I appreciate what you are baking into guidance in terms of asset values. But wondering to what degree the guidance assumes lower retention rates to come on subscription revenues in the rest of the year and particularly in Q4, please?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I would – as you know, the subscription base is slow-moving beast. And so even adjustments to the retention rate around the hedges or sales don’t have a meaningful impact in the current year. So, I would say the bigger impact for this year is really around asset-based fees.
Russell Quelch: Okay. Cool. Thanks Andy. And then just following up from that sort of related, what are you assuming you can do on pricing to offset any increase in cancellations or inflation in the cost base, please?
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. I would say that price increases continue to be at a higher level than they have been in recent years, and they continue to contribute a larger percentage of new recurring sales. We have been successful with capturing price increases with clients. And we actually, in the first quarter, probably even saw a slightly higher contribution to recurring subscription sales than we even saw last quarter. I would say we will continue to be measured on this front and ensure that we are delivering value to our clients in connection with price increases. But where we are delivering value, we will continue to extract price and seem to be getting traction with it.
Russell Quelch: Okay. Good stuff. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Greg Simpson with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Greg Simpson: Hi. I appreciate you taking my questions. And can I just ask if you can share some thoughts on the potential implications of AI for MSCI longer term? What are you doing today? What applications are you exploring actively? I know it’s a broad question, but just would be interested to hear your thoughts there.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So look, we are actively – have quite a few projects going in AI across everything from client service, where we think it has great applications in reading our enormous amounts of methodology books and complex formulas and etcetera and giving clear answers. We are working on it – with it in ESG and all of the data applications that can go there. I mean there is a whole list of it, but we are extremely focused on it. And we would love to tell you more clearly in a slightly different context, but we are definitely very focused on the use of AI across the business.
Greg Simpson: Great. Thank you. And it seems like fixed income is an asset class that you are seeing a lot more interest from investors in this higher rate environment. I think you got $79 million in run rate. Can you just talk about which parts of MSCI that comes into? And are there opportunities to add more scale here since it’s growing past its relatively small part of your total business?
Baer Pettit: Yes, for sure. So, it’s both a very important part in our analytics story, both on a standalone basis and as part of multi-asset class risk. And we are really doing a lot of innovation in index. We are clearly starting from a tiny base, but we have got some really exciting things going on there related to ESG and climate, relating to liquidity. I am actually seeing a client this evening for dinner related to some credit and fixed income opportunities. So, we think it’s an area where people are very excited to see us bringing things forward, and I think it will be important part of our growth story going forward.
Greg Simpson: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Henry Fernandez for any closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you for joining us this morning. As you heard us say, our all-weather franchise continued to perform well in this challenging operating environment. These are times when companies differentiate themselves, these are times of opportunity, sometimes more than risk. And that’s what we are fully intending to capitalize on, and we will be more than happy to keep you abreast of all of that in future calls. Thank you very much again and have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may all now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to now turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may now begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter of 2022. This press release, along with an earnings presentation, will be referenced on this call as well as a brief quarterly update, are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We, therefore, caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. We will also discuss organic growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the face of significant global headwinds, MSCI delivered strong fourth quarter results to cap off another successful year. Among our fourth quarter highlights, we posted organic revenue growth of 7%, including organic subscription revenue growth of 16% despite a reduction in our AUM-linked revenue. This growth, combined with our intense focus on expense management, drove adjusted EPS growth of 13%. In terms of capital management, we repurchased more than $70 million worth of MSCI shares. You would also note that our Board of Directors has approved increasing the dividend by 10% to $1.38 per share. For 2022 as a whole, we posted organic revenue growth of 9%, including organic subscription revenue growth of 15%. We also achieved adjusted EPS growth of 15%, and our share repurchases totaled nearly $1.3 billion. We delivered these results despite historic levels of market volatility, which makes us cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. MSCI continues to benefit from our diversified all-weather franchise, which allows us to thrive in all environments. In 2022, over 97% of our revenue came from three recurring revenue streams, including recurring subscription revenue, which was about 74% of the total; recurring AUM-linked revenue, which was 21%; and recurrent listed futures and options transaction-based revenue, which was about 3%. While the external environment created headwinds and more variability for AUM, our subscription and transaction-based derivatives businesses performed well through difficult operating conditions. We have once again demonstrated the balance, adaptability and resilience of our franchise, which has enabled us to continue making critical investments in long-term secular growth areas. These investments are helping MSCI expand and enhance our solutions to meet the needs of an increasingly diversified and diverse client base. Baer will talk about our solutions in greater detail. For now, I would like to explore the strategic backdrop for both our 2022 results and our 2023 priorities. MSCI continues to see enormous growth opportunities across product lines, asset classes and client segments. At times like this, investors become even more reliant on high-quality data, models, analytics and research to help them understand fast-moving market changes. MSCI is constantly monitoring for signs of pressure that our clients could face from reduced budgets and longer sales cycles to increased layoffs and fewer new fund raises. That being said, we are cautiously optimistic on the path forward. Our strategy continues to capture major structural shifts in the investment world. For starters, index investing is increasingly popular across regions, asset classes and investor types. The reason is simple. Index investing gives investors an efficient mechanism to express their investment thesis and preferences and to focus on asset allocation. During periods of financial turmoil, the unique strength of MSCI's Index business become even more salient. We can offer one-stop shop for different types of indices across many layers, including asset classes, exposures, styles and investment teams. I have spoken before about the massive potential of direct indexing in particular. I want to emphasize that MSCI dramatically strengthened our direct indexing market position in 2022. For the full year, we increased our total number of direct indexing clients by 200%. The index investing trend reflects a broader shift toward outcome-oriented investment strategies. ESG investing is a big part of that. As you know, ESG has become a hot button political issue, especially in the United States. However, political noise is different from investment reality. And the reality is that ESG risks are financial risks. That is why even as the parties and the bank gets launder, investors continue to make ESG integration a priority. For example, the Index Industry Association recently surveyed investment fund companies across the U.S., U.K., Germany and France. An overwhelming majority of the respondents said that ESG has become more important to their investment strategy between 2021 and 2022. These findings are reinforced by client demand for MSCI's ESG solutions, which has remained strong. No single issue has done more to elevate ESG than climate change. In 2022, climate risk became increasingly visible as countries around the world suffer from record heat waves, record drought conditions and record flooding. What is true of ESG risk in general is true of climate risks, in particular. There can be material financial risks. Investors understand that. For example, in a recent Deutsche Bank investor survey, more than 3/4 of respondents said that climate change either is already having a severely negative impact on the global economy or will have such an impact over the next 10 years if left unchecked. Investors recognize that climate change is also not only at risk but an opportunity. Consider a recent report from the International Energy Agency on renewable technologies. The IEA now projects that the world will have as much renewable power in the next five years as it did in the past 20. MSCI is determined to become the undisputed leader in climate-related investment tools. To support these ambitions, we continue to make key investments across asset classes and geographies. As a result, MSCI is now well positioned to help all types of clients achieve the net zero pledges. In 2022, we saw especially strong growth in climate sales among nontraditional client segments, especially corporates, banks and traders, wealth managers and hedge funds. We have also developed innovative climate tools for private assets, an area where we continue to see tremendous possibilities for growth. One example is the carbon foot printing of private equity and private debt funds tool that we launched with Burgiss towards the end of 2021. The key enablers for all of this remain our data and technology. MSCI's ongoing tech-driven data transformation is helping us improve the client experience in so many different ways. Last month, we expanded our strategic partnership with Microsoft to support our new MSCI One technology platform, which is built on Microsoft Azure. Just last week, MSCI announced another strategic partnership with Google Cloud to build an investment data acquisition and development platform. This new platform will make it easier for ourselves and our clients to translate world data into actionable insights. As I mentioned earlier, the importance of our data, models, analytics and research only increases during periods of market turmoil. Our solutions play an essential role in helping investors navigate today's volatile landscape and build better portfolios. At the same time, MSCI's resilient, all-weather franchise continues to allow us to invest for the future while maintaining strong profitability growth. Just one final note before I turn the call over to Baer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing that Baer has been appointed to the MSCI Board of Directors effective immediately. I would like to congratulate him on his well-deserved appointment. As many of you know, Baer and I have been close business partners for 23 years, and he has been instrumental in building MSCI into what it is today. Baer's unique skills, experience and strategic thinking will significantly strengthen the Board's effectiveness and ability to continue to create shareholder value. I would also like to be clear that my role is not changing at all. I have no plans or timetable to retire or step down as CEO or Chairman of the Board. I remain extremely engaged and energized by the company's tremendous growth prospects. If anything, I am more excited today but our significant opportunities that I have been at any time in the 27 years that I've been leading this business. I look forward to continuing to partner very closely with Baer for many more years as CEO and President and now as fellow Board members. Again, congratulations to Baer, whom I now will turn the call over to. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. I'm excited to join the Board and serve our shareholders in this very important role. MSCI is in the midst of many strategic transformations. As President and Chief Operating Officer, I've developed the operational insights and strategic vision that I believe will bring a new dimension to the Board to help MSCI drive shareholder value and deliver on our growth initiatives. Now I will turn to my comments on our quarterly performance. I'll begin by going over some of the highlights for the quarter, the steps that we took to manage in the current environment and some of our priorities for 2023. MSCI's continued ability to deliver strong organic growth and resilient retention during the quarter is directly linked to the investments that we have consistently made over the years, both in good markets and in less supportive ones. As we had indicated to you previously, with the backdrop of unprecedented market headwinds and volatility, we aggressively managed the pace of our discretionary spend and also made select head count realignments to best position MSCI for 2023 and beyond and to preserve our ability to deploy our investments to the greatest opportunities guided by client demand. For our 2023 investment plan, these areas continue to include climate, ESG, client design indexes, fixed income and the ongoing modernization of the client experience. To further illustrate the success of our approach, I will spotlight specific accomplishments during the quarter in Index, Analytics and climate. In Index, we delivered 12% organic recurring subscription revenue growth and 95% retention, which was certainly reflective of the strength of our franchise, our strong client relationships and the investments we've made. In custom indexes, our subscription run rate grew 15% as we continue to invest heavily in the development of our models, software and data to deliver custom indexes at scale. These investments have increased our index building capabilities, reduced turnaround time and strengthened our global support model, positioning us well to capture the enormous opportunities that we see ahead. We are also benefiting from continued investments into our index derivatives franchise. In listed futures and options, we've delivered record full year revenue of $61 million, where we're benefiting from new product launches for Paris-aligned climate action and low carbon target indexes with exchanges driven by ongoing asset owner demand to facilitate the net zero transition. In addition, sales of structured products linked to our indexes were $23 million, growing more than 60% year-on-year for the full year. We remain excited by the opportunities in fixed income indexes, another long-term investment area for MSCI, especially in the current period where investors are focused on credit allocations now that they can earn higher yields with less duration. At the end of December, fixed income ETF AUM linked to MSCI's proprietary and partner indexes was $46 billion, after attracting more than $19 billion of inflows during 2022. We believe our flanking strategy, where we play to MSCI's strength in ESG and climate, as well as our ability to forge partnerships with key players in the fixed income space have all been growth enablers. Let me now turn to Analytics, where we drove 7% subscription run rate growth, excluding FX. New subscription sales were lower versus a strong fourth quarter in 2021 while also experiencing higher cancels which were not so much reflective of higher cancel volumes, but rather from a few concentrated large client events. It's important to remember what MSCI is trying to achieve in Analytics. We already have a large business in enterprise risk and performance, which drove about 60% of our new subscription sales. These tools can serve as large operating systems for investors to help investors in asset allocation decisions and in calculating and understanding their risk and performance attribution. We also offer tools for more targeted use cases such as our equity models and portfolio construction tools that clients can integrate into their investment processes and third-party vendors can integrate into their platforms. These offerings comprise roughly 1/3 of our new recurring sales during the quarter. Throughout 2022, our Analytics growth came from both types of tools, and we believe the same will be true in 2023. The investments MSCI has made in modern, flexible distribution channels are enabling us to chip away at new opportunities. including with front office investment professionals and increasingly for climate use cases where we see a strong pipeline for the upcoming year. These include our investments in platforms such as Climate Lab Enterprise, where we have delivered over 15,000 climate reports throughout the year for our analytics clients since our launch in late 2021. Our unique position of having our clients' portfolios loaded in maps represents a competitive differentiator. It has allowed us to help clients understand all the carbon emissions as well as physical and transition risks associated with their holdings. As Henry indicated, climate remains one of the most attractive and tangible opportunities for MSCI as a firm to help the investment industry. Across all MSCI product lines, we delivered $79 million of run rate, growing around 80% year-over-year, with momentum across all client segments and regions. Back in June, we launched our total portfolio footprinting tool, which helps clients measure portfolio-wide emissions across ad cases, including equities, munis, corporate bonds, sovereigns and private assets. Since then, it's been a key enabler for closing several strategic deals with asset managers banks, insurance companies and others. It's also enabled us to help clients align with emerging PCAP standards. We also continue to drive new wins with large asset manager and asset owner clients to help them with specific use cases, including TCFD reporting, climate stress testing and scenario analysis. Following the recent launch of MSCI One, I wanted to make a few clarifying observations as to what we're trying to accomplish. It is not a new product or a stand-alone new platform to replace other products. It is instead a vehicle for integrating MSCI's world-leading content and analytics using software powered by Azure. We are now up providing clients with a common entry point to access some of our key products and applications that they rely on day-to-day, including climate lab, RiskManager, ESG manager and others, which we believe will also enable self-servicing, self-discovery and upsell opportunities. In summary, the high-returning investments we made in 2022 and our rigorous financial management helped us execute successfully during the year. Our success provides a template for how MSCI will continue to operate and thrive in 2023 and the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hi, everyone. As Henry mentioned, we completed 2022 by delivering organic subscription revenue growth nearly 16% for the quarter and 15% for the full year, outperforming our long-term target of low double-digit growth. In the face of market headwinds, our results reflect the durability of our franchise and the benefits of the consistent investments we've made into attractive high-growth areas. In Index, subscription run rate growth was 12% in the quarter, our 36th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We've seen tremendous traction and healthy growth within our market cap-weighted modules as our buy-side clients broaden their usage of our indexes. And we continue to see the utility of our index content expand across a wide range of high-growth segments. Across our Index subscription base, asset managers and asset owners together had subscription run rate growth of 10%, while hedge funds, broker-dealers and wealth managers together grew 17%. We also saw continued momentum in our investment thesis index offerings with nonmarket cap index modules collectively achieving a subscription run rate growth of 14%. From the end of September through year-end, market appreciation contributed approximately $119 billion to AUM balances of equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, although for the full year, we saw a net decline of $284 billion in AUM balances. Additionally, we were encouraged by the $23 billion of cash inflows into ETFs linked to our equity indexes during the quarter with roughly $15 billion of inflows into emerging market exposures and over $9 billion into developed market exposures. Equity ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and climate indexes experienced inflows of $6.5 billion, representing approximately 70% market share. Flows into ETFs linked to MSCI factor indexes were more muted but still positive with investor appetite more focused on yield and income where we have less presence than on other factors where indexes are more widely used, such as momentum and minimum volatility. During the fourth quarter, the run rate basis points on AUM paid to us by ETF clients was flat year-over-year supported by a mix shift out of lower fee products. Despite the steady levels over the last year, we continue to believe the average basis points on AUM paid to us by ETF clients will gradually decline over time, although we expect the declines will be more than offset by strong growth in assets. In listed futures and options, we once again saw some of the natural hedges embedded in our asset-based fee revenue line as traded volumes showed healthy growth against the choppy market backdrop. Looking ahead, if market levels continue to rebound and stabilize, we would hope this would be constructive to AUM-linked revenues from ETFs and non-ETF passive. At the same time, futures and options volume and revenues may decline compared to the volatile period a year ago. We continue to believe our opportunity is significant in licensing indexes for both AUM-linked ETF and non-ETF passive products as well as in transaction-based listed derivatives products. In Analytics, subscription run rate growth was nearly 7%, excluding FX. As Bart mentioned, we continue to gain traction in front-office use cases supported by tremendous strength in our factory analytics and our climate tools in recent quarters. Additionally, our growth has been supported by firm-wide enhancements to our interfaces and progress in delivering broader, more flexible access to our content. However, as we have previously noted, we expect some lumpiness in the segment across both sales and cancels given the broad range of clients and use cases that we support. In our ESG and Climate segment, new recurring subscription sales grew 64% from the third quarter as we saw some rebound in large-ticket deals in both ESG research and in Climate and tremendous traction in closing deals in EMEA. Climate remains one of the most attractive growth engines for MSCI. Our firm-wide climate run rate reached $79 million, an increase of 80% from a year ago, reflecting exceptional growth across geographies, product offerings and client segments. Across all of our segments, we continue to see strong secular demand for mission-critical must-have tools, and we continue to see a strong sales pipeline, although we remain cautious given the market backdrop. As we have mentioned previously, in past periods of sustained equity market pullbacks, we can sometimes see slightly elevated levels of cancels and lengthening of sales cycles. In connection with our downturn playbook, we continue to identify efficiencies to aggressively reposition our expense base to drive attractive profitability growth while preserving investments in the most critical growth opportunities. As part of our regular review of our talent and our expense base in the fourth quarter, we took proactive actions to regrade our employee footprint, resulting in a $16 million severance charge, which was roughly $13 million higher than a year ago. These tough actions have allowed us to preserve and even enhance our investment spending in certain key areas. This expense discipline, coupled with our subscription revenue growth, has enabled us to drive strong growth in adjusted EPS even through tough environments. The tremendous growth in our subscription base has been supported by doing more for our clients, continuing to penetrate newer large addressable markets and capturing price increases enabled by the continuous enhancements to our products and client experience. During the fourth quarter, price increases contributed about 35% of our new subscription sales firm-wide across all products and more than 40% within index. We ended the year with a cash balance of $994 million, of which well over $600 million is readily available. Free cash flow came in slightly below the low end of our previous guidance. We saw a small slowdown in client collection cycles as a result of extra approvals within certain clients, which we believe is related to the market backdrop. But we believe overall collections remain healthy, and we see no issues around collectability. Our capital allocation framework, which is focused on maximizing shareholder returns, remained unchanged. We will continue to deploy our investment dollars towards the highest returning organic growth areas, return capital through a steady dividend that increases with adjusted EPS and opportunistically capitalize on share repurchases and pursue value-generative MP&A. As Henry indicated earlier, we have decided to increase our dividend in the first quarter. We are not making any changes to our dividend policy or a broader approach to capital allocation. We have decided to shift our annual dividend increase from the third quarter, where we have historically announced the increase to the first quarter in order to more closely align with our annual planning process. Lastly, I want to underscore that we also continue to actively evaluate and source bolt-on M&A opportunities, particularly in areas of unique content and differentiating capabilities such as private assets, climate and ESG as well as fixed income. Lastly, I would like to turn to our 2023 guidance, which we published earlier this morning. Our guidance ranges reflect the assumption of continued volatility in financial markets with overall equity market levels down slightly from current levels during the first half of the year and gradually recovering in the second half of the year. Our expense guidance range reflects the efficiency actions we have taken in recent months and captures the investments we will continue to make in order to deliver growth. We expect normal seasonality in our expenses with $15 million to $20 million of elevated benefits and compensation-related expenses in the first quarter. I also want to highlight that our CapEx guidance reflects a continued high level of software capitalization as we continue to enhance our platforms and interfaces across product lines. Our tax rate guidance highlights that we expect our effective tax rate to increase slightly year-over-year primarily reflecting that we expect to receive a smaller windfall benefit in the first quarter as a result of where the share price is relative to the price at grant as well as based on the amount of awards vesting. There could be pressure on year-over-year adjusted EPS growth in the first quarter due to the higher tax rate and the significant decline in average ETF AUM levels relative to the average levels during Q1 of last year. Lastly, I want to highlight that our free cash flow guidance reflects the expectation of higher cash tax payments in 2023 as well as a slight degree of caution on client collection cycles based on the environment, consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter. Overall, we're well positioned for the year ahead, and we're excited to continue to drive growth and differentiation. In periods of volatility and uncertainty, we believe MSCI is uniquely positioned to help our clients capitalize on unique opportunities and drive value creation. These are the times when MSCI thrives. We look forward to keeping you all posted on our progress. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex, please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone. Starting off maybe on the retention side for a second here, that dropped, I guess, from the 3Q to 4Q pretty decently relative to the last couple of years. I think if I look in history, it's probably more seasonal. But I'm just wondering if there's anything that you saw that gives you any sort of pause into this year. You mentioned the things on the analytics side. But outside of that, anything that gives you a little bit more pause as you think about the sustainability of results?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, hi Alex, it's Andy. So we - as you know and you alluded to, we typically do have slightly lower retention rates in the fourth quarter, given that it's our largest period of renewals. I would say, outside of analytics, and you can see this, the retention rates were reasonably strong. And if you look at full year retention rates even for analytics, but across all product segments, the retention rates were actually quite healthy. I'd say it continues to highlight that our products really do benefit from the fact that they are mission critical in areas of long-term secular growth, which does create some resiliency. And I think you see that heavily in the retention rates for the full year. However, I would say we do remain cautious. As I've alluded to in the past, when we see a few quarters of sustained market pullback. We tend to see a pickup in client events, things like fund closures, desk closures, restructurings, other, mergers. So despite the overall strong retention rates for the year, we are proceeding with a degree of caution and are pretty sober that we might see some clients pulling back a little bit in certain areas. So we are cautious moving forward here.
Alex Kramm: Okay. And then secondly, and this is somewhat related, but first of all, thanks for clarifying some of the moving pieces on free cash flow. I think some people are trying to read too much into what that means on the revenue side, which is kind of like my question. I know you don't guide revenues, but you highlighted again the long-term targets and history of delivering double-digit, I guess, subscription growth look at the asset side for a minute - as a base side for a minute? Anything that would change your view on that low double-digits as we think about 2023 given some of the starting off points and some of the cautionary comments you've potentially made a little bit just now?
Henry Fernandez: So, Alex, Henry not at all I mean, obviously, on a tactical short-term basis in 2023, we've done well in 2022. We have a strong pipeline going into 2023, but - there is the prospect of a global recession - global softness. There is war going on in Europe, right. There is disruption in many markets, including the energy markets. We have to see if there is a real reopening of China or a return to lockdown. So, we remain cautious in the very short-term. Beyond that, we remain extremely positive. The number of opportunities that we see at MSCI is increasing exponentially pretty much every day, whether it's custom indices, which we have high demand for whether it is direct indexing, whether it's climate risk in the context of analytics. Clearly ESG, climate as a whole, the work that we're beginning to do in private asset classes, enormous so, that should bode well for a continuation of our growth trajectory for the company in the years to come.
Alex Kramm: Fair enough, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni, please go ahead 
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to take a step back and look at margins within the analytics business, really stepped up a lot this year. I guess, how are you thinking about investment in that business? Are you investing enough there? Just maybe talk about the drivers of the margin expansion and basically investment needs or growth opportunities?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, so similar to recent quarters, there have been several factors that have been contributing to the high analytics margin. I would point out that we have been capitalizing a higher level of expenses related to the development work that we've been doing around things like our Climate Lab Enterprise, Risk Insights, broader enhancements that we're making to the capabilities in analytics. I would also highlight that many of the downturn actions that we've been taking end up hitting analytics. And that's not just directly within the segment. But when we take actions in corporate functions, a meaningful portion of those expenses are allocated to analytics. And then I would highlight that the analytics has benefited from the strong U.S. dollar as well. Given the size of the expense base, a lot of the FX benefits that we've been getting have hit analytics. And so there are a bunch of those more, I'll call it, technical or tactical factors that have impacted the analytics margin and caused it to run up a bit here. But to your question around investments, listen we continue to be very targeted with our investments in analytics. So we are investing there. It is not one of our top investment areas. I think you're familiar with those areas where we are heavily focused on. But within analytics, we are focused on investing on those - in those capabilities that support the broader MSCI franchise as well as continuing to focus on investments in areas like the front office, so front on office content, including our factor models, how we go to the office on the equity and fixed income front office capabilities as well as some of the broader interfaces and applications, that not only benefit the analytics users, but also the broader MSCI franchise.
Henry Fernandez: I would like to add, Toni, if you don't mind, the - clearly, there are parts of analytics that we're putting heavy investments on like Climate Lab Enterprise, fixed income, portfolio analytics, equity portfolio analytics and some of the content. But also for the benefit of everyone in this call, we also run a very, disciplined, very rigorous Triple-Crown investment process in the company, in which each one of the product areas. Each one of the client segment areas and some of the support areas, when they come to - in front of this investment process, they have to demonstrate elements of the Triple-Crown. One is high return, high IRR shorter-term paybacks and in areas of high multiple valuations for the company. So in the case of Analytics, they've been able to rationalize investment in some of the areas that I mentioned, but not in other areas. So they haven't gotten capital from us because of that. Other areas like climate and ESG and custom indices and the like have gotten the capital.
Toni Kaplan: Perfect. I wanted to ask my follow-up on MSCI ONE. I know you recently launched that. Maybe just clarify - I know you said it's not really supposed to replace an old product or be sort of a new stand-alone platform to replace other products. So I guess maybe help us with who the main users are there, what the opportunity is there, because I think it seems meaningful. And I just want to understand it a little bit better? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Sure, Toni Baer here. So look, I think the way to think about it is through a few different layers. One is we clearly have a diverse range of calculation engines, which create kind of state-of-the-art analytics of various kind and outputs, which are distributed throughout the firm and different asset classes, et cetera. Then we have some traditional platforms and other distribution methods through files, et cetera, that we've had. And then, we have sort of newer content that we're building. So the way to - the best thing - way to think about MSCI on is a combination of those traditional outputs of our - if you like, our calculation factory and sort of industry standard software that allows those to be presented in a more user-friendly way and brought together in a similar type of platform, which in turn improves both the user experience and users' ability to manipulate that data to do - to have greater flexibility in how they present it, et cetera. So for sure, we think we're on a very important path forward here. It's incremental. As we move forward during the course of 2023, we think that the client impact of that will increase. And we hope - definitely hope and intend to continue to give you positive news and update around all of that. So I think there is maybe a - how should I put it, a risk that we're understanding this somewhat. And that's what I try to wanted to make some comments about it today. At the same time, we want to make sure that we are the delivery department and not the promise department in this area. So as the year progresses, we'll make sure that as we bring out new functionality, new capabilities, new ways of integrating and our clients start using those more, we'll keep you abreast of that. But we're certainly very positive about it. And we think that, over time, this will really be a way that our clients start to think of MSCI in a different way as regards the flexibility and the ease of use of - in their day-to-day working with our content.
Toni Kaplan: Sounds great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav, please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Andy, I just wanted to get back to the retention rate comments you made, the drop, I guess, particularly in analytics. Can you just give us some color around, I guess, where those cancellations or the drop came from? And were they more kind of on time closures in nature? I know you said you're being a little bit more cautious going into '22. But just trying to understand how - what that is and how that might continue into '23.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, sure. Yes. Thanks, Manav. So Baer noted this in his prepared remarks, but the cancels weren't so much reflective of a higher frequency of cancels across the board in the segment but rather a concentration of a few large ones. On those few large ones, there were some competitive dynamics and some client event-related dynamics at play. And as we've mentioned in the past, we do expect some continued lumpiness in both sales and cancels within analytics and potentially some impact from the environment. So more broadly, we are really encouraged by the momentum and improving competitive position. We continue to see in the strategic focus areas that we're focused on in analytics like equity and fixed income portfolio management tools or climate tools or enhancements to content and capabilities. And we are committed to the long-term growth targets that we've got for the segment of high single digits, which, actually, we're quite close to in the fourth quarter, the subscription run rate growth on an organic basis, close to 7%. And the revenue was 9.5%, excluding FX. So it was a quarter that demonstrated some of the lumpiness. But overall, we continue to be encouraged by the momentum we see in the segment.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you. And then Henry or Baer, I guess just a broader question. Just trying to - I mean I think as someone - it, but I thought I'd take the opportunity. Just trying to understand the cloud and technology strategy here, the recent Google announcement versus your key partnerships you already have with Microsoft. Just trying to appreciate the differences in each of those agreements and what to look forward to.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Manav. So the - first of all, I mean, one of the major impetus and investment in our firm is in our data and technology platforms. MSCI, in the past - in the recent past was a very large data processing company. We took third-party data and run it through risk models, factor models, indices and the like, mix methodologies and the like, where MSCI has become, starting with the ESG business, now with climate and private assets and so on and so forth is a large data building in our company in addition to data processing company. So we are now the original source of a lot of data in addition to sourcing data from third parties. And all of that needs to be distributed to our clients in a very effective way. So we have basically three partnerships that we're trying to work and expand and specialize on. The first one clearly has been the Microsoft partnership in Azure, in which they're helping us with the data processing part, processing large amounts of data, especially in our risk systems and all of that, index systems, et cetera. And the partnership there also will help helping us on their software and how do we use their software to build products like in power behind. Obviously, we announced the MSCI One is a partnership with them. So that is Microsoft, and that continues to deepen and strengthen. The second one that we announced is Google and the Google Cloud. That partnership is about Google helping on build data, collect data, organize data, index data in this data building transformation that we're going through and then run all of that data through their cloud as well. So that is definitely - there's always a component of cloud computing, but the push here is data building. As you know, Google is one of the largest data building and data processing companies in the world. Everyone focuses on the search engine, but there's a search engine won't be as good at all without the - data. And the third partnership is South Lake which is in the distribution of our content, our beta in a very effective way with our clients. So we're trying to strengthen and deepen that in our relationship with now.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you very much.
Operator: And now we have a question from Alexander Hess from JPMorgan. Alexander, please go ahead.
Alexander Hess: Yes, hi everybody. I'd like to step back and maybe look at the firm-wide ESG and climate run rate growth, which remained pretty resilient despite the U.S. political headlines and then maybe in Europe, some of the SFTR implementation noise. I wanted to know maybe stepping back high level, what do you see sort of as the big opportunities, the big sort of regulatory and market tailwinds and headwinds as well and how we should think about maybe ESG and climate's ability to grow over the next few years?
Henry Fernandez: So let me provide some quick comments and then pass it on to Baer. First of all, as I said in my prepared remarks, there is a lot of political football here going on, on ESG. And eventually, we'll get to climate as well. And - but the first point is our ESG business has nothing to do with political ideology of political philosophies. Our ESG business totally grounded on the fact that ESG or nonfinancial risks are material investment risks and material financial risks in a company, things that we're - right now. corporate governance, right? The governance of the company and the auditors and all of that and $60-plus-billion market cap now because nobody tells you that's political and that's not investment risk. Then I don't know what it is investment risk. So that is very clear what we're doing. And therefore, we don't know of any single client in the world that at least we haven't heard of that they're not looking to integrate this nonfinancial risk environment in governance and social issues into their investment processes. And we are the preferred provider of tools to them. Secondly, clearly, there is a lot of regulations around the world, and a lot of our clients are trying to figure out how do they respond to that regulation, especially in Europe by far but also in the U.S. with the SEC proposals. So there is a little bit of a pause by clients and certain purchaser as to - because they're trying to determine what are the right sets of data and tools and risk that they need to do to incorporate into their products. So that's been a little bit of the blip that you see in the sales, much less so the political component. But Baer, anything else on this?
Baer Pettit: I think you've covered it well, Henry. I think the only other element is clearly the - you mentioned the regulatory element on our clients, which has been notably a complex one for funds in Europe and the EU. So that is something that we're very focused on, on working with our clients on. Equally, there will doubtless be an increase of regulation on the providers of data information ratings of ESG clearly which would include us. And I think in that instance, we don't view that as something which is a particular risk to the business. We believe that we run a very high-quality business that we've been structured with a view that, as an index, some form of further regulation could come to us. And as a reminder, our legal entity in the U.S. that issued ESG ratings is already a registered investment adviser, and we're confident about the way that, that is run and I'm actually getting contact with regulators related to that. So I think overall, it's clearly an environment which is very noisy and complex from a number of grounds, but that doesn't, in any way, compromise the scale of the opportunity which remains very real. And in many regards, precisely this regulatory complexity is something which we believe we can benefit from as a provider of high-quality data and adjacent research.
Alexander Hess: And then as a quick follow-up, maybe can you speak a little bit to the opportunity in Paris Aligned benchmarks and climate transition benchmarks with the index franchise. Is that a meaningful opportunity going forward?
Baer Pettit: Absolutely. So we're clearly benefiting from our leadership role, both in ESG and climate and our market share in such indexing and related ETF products is very high, and it's been consistently so. There are some questions related to flows in the short run, but we're - if you look at - I'm very confident that if you look back on this in a number of years' time, that this will be a moment that passes. And the fact of the matter is that, with all categories of investors globally, this is an enormous transition they have to go through. They will clearly do so through active management. But equally, they will need to do so by allocating capital on a timely basis through rule through indexes, through rules-based portfolios that indexes serve as a benchmark and underlying for - so we only see this category as growing. And you mentioned certain specific methodologies, those will continue to grow as will many customized versions of things which serve specific investors' specific need. So we certainly view it as an important and growing category.
Alexander Hess: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Owen, please go ahead.
Owen Lau: Thank you for taking my question. I want to go back to your guidance. Could you please talk about your assumption about the market trend to come up with your free cash flow guidance. Do you expect the market to go up, stay flat or to go lower from here? And then on the expense side, could you please talk about the walk of the adjusted EBITDA expense build from 2022 to 2023? And what does it take to go to the low end of the guidance? And also what does it take to get to the high end of the guidance? Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Sure. So a lot in there. I'll try to unpack it in a logical fashion here. So firstly, on the market assumptions that underlie all of our guidance. So we are assuming that market levels declined slightly from their current levels through the first half of the year and then rebound in the second half of the year. And so that assumption is underlying every piece of our guidance. You alluded to free cash flow. I do want to make a comment around our free cash flow guidance more generally, just to underscore that we are being cautious on it. if you look at the full year of 2022 relative to 2021 and even the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to the fourth quarter of '21, we saw a pretty healthy growth in free cash flow. Although if you remember, after the third quarter, we actually increased our free cash flow guidance. We made that change feeling confident about the strong momentum we had seen in collections. To be frank, we probably got a bit of ahead of ourselves on that one, and we actually saw a bit of a slowdown in collection cycles in the fourth quarter. And so we are making that same assumption of caution around collection cycles for 2023. And as a result, we have a degree of caution on our cash flow guidance for this year. On the expense guidance piece, I don't want to get too specific here, but I want to underscore that - and you saw this in the fourth quarter, actually the last six months or so, we have been taking very tough actions in our expenses and identifying efficiencies to be able to continue to invest. So we are being very measured on our pace of expense growth. We're continuing to find efficiencies. You saw we took some significant actions on the severance front in the fourth quarter. And so that has a meaningful impact on the expense base, although we are continuing to invest in key areas. And so despite those efficiencies and continued actions on the head count front, we are planning to grow our investment spend in 2023 by 13%, and that's more than double the overall expense growth. And so we are, in our guidance, assuming that we continue to be quite disciplined in a number of areas, especially for the first half of the year. But we are continuing to grow head count and invest in those key investment areas, those key growth areas for us as a firm.
Owen Lau: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then I want to go back to the Google partnership, the Google Cloud partnership. Henry, could you please talk about maybe the potential incremental revenue and an expense opportunity for this partnership? I mean it would be great if you can even give us some more specific examples so that we can better understand the value creation of this partnership. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: So look, I can't, at this point, give you any numeric analysis of the revenue or profit or any of that. Too early to tell. What is very key is that in us becoming a very large data building company, we need to use the most advanced methods and protocols and technologies and all of that and this partnership with Google will give us that. And for example, one specific area that we're focused on right now is asset locations. So in order for us to be the best, undisputed leader in climate, we need to have understanding of every manufacturing facility every mine, every office of every single company in the world, whether it's private or public company. So being able to work with Google in gathering that information through Google maps and Google's geospatial services and the like will put us at a significant advantage there. That would be clearly one example of that. Another example clearly is the - in the work that we're doing in the private assets, there is a lot of data that we're collecting from GPs and LPs and all of that, and we need to figure out how we index the data, organize it and the like. So the way to think about us, if you want to compare us to - obviously, to the work that Google does is that everyone focuses on the search engine of Google, right? And that's at the top. But on the - search engine is clearly data. So think about our investment tools, whether it's indices methodologies and ratings and risk models and the stress testing models and all that, the equivalent of search engines, like the equivalent of algorithms. And then underneath that, they have to be a base of data that is large, whether it's third-party data or our own data that is large, and that's what we're trying to build with that.
Owen Lau: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we have a question now from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. George, please go ahead.
GeorgeTong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned it's possible you'll see higher cancels and longer sales cycles during protracted periods of market volatility. Can you elaborate on where in your subscription businesses you're seeing most sensitivity to the macro environment and, conversely, where you're seeing most resilience?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I mean it's very much a general comment that I made. You can see in the retention rates that, with the exception of the lumpiness we saw in Analytics in the fourth quarter, actually, our retention rates have remained quite resilient. I think you've heard us make comments in - particularly last quarter, that we saw some slowdown in sales cycle and in ESG. I'd say that the point that I would underscore is it's going to be dynamic across the board. So I don't think it will be necessarily concentrated in one product area or region or client segment, but these are things that just as the environment remains choppy and volatile and large financial organizations start to implement cost controls, it can cause slowdowns across the Board. And so we're just baking in our color and our commentary here, a degree of caution, although I do want to underscore that our pipeline is - it remains quite healthy and the overall size of the pipeline is quite large, and we are having an active dialogue and engagement and healthy discussion with our clients. It's just we've seen in past cycles that we should be prudent and cautious in our outlook.
GeorgeTong: Got it. That's helpful. You've taken actions to recalibrate head count and expenses as part of your downturn playbook. Can you talk about how much further runway you have for expense reduction, what kind of levers you have remaining? And would you say the majority of your cost rightsizing actions are now behind you?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I would say, and I alluded to this in a prior question, it's important to really underscore that the tough actions we've been taking are really to enable investment. And so as I alluded to, we plan to continue to invest at a pretty healthy rate in those key investment areas, and we're going to continue to have an intense focus on efficiencies throughout the year. Beyond the proactive actions that we took in - on the severance front, and I alluded to this in the past, we've continued to slow down and even stop hiring in certain less critical areas. We've been very selective about the areas where we are adding people we've imposed certain expense controls in areas like T&E and other professional fees. But it is important to underscore, we have numerous levers at our disposal, and we haven't fully flexed the downturn playbook nor does our guidance reflect that we're flexing fully our downturn playbook. We can stop hiring in certain areas, implement hiring freeze is closing backfills. We have degrees of freedom on the non-comp side. As you know, our incentive compensation will move with the performance of the business. So it is a constant calibration and something that we're going to continue to proactively manage. But we are being cautious in implementing cost controls, but we do have many more levers if we need to flex down further, including slowing down investment, which hopefully we don't have to do, but that clearly can help us manage expenses. Very
GeorgeTong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Now we have a question from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Faiza, please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you. Good morning. And so I wanted to talk a little bit more about ESG. Give us a sense of the new subscription sales that you signed on this quarter. How much of that is just a seasonal acceleration from 3Q to 4Q? Or are you seeing sort of sales cycles? And as you alluded to, the last quarter that those had increased a little bit. Are you seeing further increase in those sales cycles? Or are things sort of normalizing from your perspective?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. And I think you could see this in the past, and this is the case across most product areas. But as you alluded to, the fourth quarter does tend to be a strong quarter for us. I would underscore that ESG and Climate had a very strong year overall. And when you drill into it, and we've alluded to this, climate within there continues to grow at an incredible growth rate and is making a more meaningful contribution to the overall segment. And so that is something that is helping to fuel some momentum. Just to put a finer point on that, $45 million of the $79 million of climate run rate is actually within the ESG and Climate segment, and that is growing at close to 80%. So that's helping to drive some of the momentum we've seen. As Henry alluded to earlier, there are many layers and dimensions of growth in ESG and climate across a wide range of solutions serving various objectives and a wide range of use cases. And we're seeing that the thinking around how to integrate ESG continues to evolve. The regulations continue to evolve. And as a result, investors in spots are being more measured in their buying decisions. And so I think there is some element of that. There's some element of the market backdrop that are helping to contribute to the fact that the pace of sales in ESG and climate is likely to fluctuate up and down based on all those dimensions that I alluded to. Overall, we continue to see very healthy growth and strong demand. But for those reasons, we think the growth rate will be a little bit dynamic and the sales could be a little bit dynamic quarter-to-quarter. I would highlight that, because you asked about it, some of those sales that we did see slip from the third quarter that we alluded to on the last call, we were successfully able to close a lot of those, and we had particular strength within EMEA. I think that just speaks to some of those dynamics that will fluctuate up and down over time. But overall, we continue to be very, very encouraged about the overall demand for the products. It's just a very dynamic engagement and discussion with our clients.
Faiza Alwy: Understood. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on, I guess, capital allocation. Are you assuming - I think your interest expense guide is a little bit higher than I was anticipating. And I'm curious if you're expecting to maybe incur higher debt to buy back shares. Or sort of what's embedded in your free cash flow guide as it relates to capital allocation?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. So the interest expense guidance does not assume any incremental financings for the year. One thing that is driving the interest expense slightly higher is our floating rate term loan A. So we have a $350 million term loan A, which is floating rate. And so we do have some expectation of rate increases and higher rates for the year, which factors into that interest expense guidance. So that's what's embedded in our guidance. But I'd say, more broadly, no change to our approach to capital allocation. We are mindful of the overall financing market and rate market. And so we will, over time, as our leverage starts to come down, look for opportunities to raise capital. But given where rates are right now, we're not in a rush to do that. And we think we're in a strong capital position to continue to be very opportunistic on the MP&A front as well as on the repurchase front if there continues to be volatility in the market.
Faiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: We have a question from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Craig, please go ahead.
Craig Huber: Great, thank you. I wanted to focus first if we could, on the recurring subscription part of your business in indexes. Obviously, the numbers continue to be extremely strong there. But maybe just talk a little further, if you would, about the sales cycles there, your sales pipeline client budgets? I mean, is there anything there that you're feeling a little less positive about stuff, particularly sales cycle?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I would say you've actually seen remarkable strength on the index subscription business that we have with the index subscription revenue line. It's been quite encouraging given the backdrop, to your point, where we've been having very constructive discussions within our more established client segments like asset owners and asset managers. And I mentioned we saw subscription run rate growth within that segment of 10%, which is quite healthy. And we've also seen - continue to see strong dialogue and engagement with hedge funds, wealth managers, broker-dealers, where we saw that elevated growth that I alluded to. Similarly, from a product lens standpoint, we are having strong momentum within our market cap modules. So our market cap modules actually had strong growth of about 11% in subscription run rate. And we saw outsized growth within some of our non-market cap modules relative to that. And so across the board, we've seen a healthy dialogue and momentum. And it's not only with these newer high-growth segments but doing more for existing clients. And so at this point, we haven't seen a lot of impact from the environment, although we are conscious that the index segment tends to have a shorter sales cycle. And so there could be some impact. But right now, it's overall a very, very healthy dialogue.
Craig Huber: Great. My follow-up question. you talked a lot about the enhancement you guys made in the analytics products. So I'd like to hear further on the fixed income side of things, what you guys are - the investor is spending to do in there, were you really focused on within the fixed income area, please?
Baer Pettit: Sure. So look, this has clearly been a multiyear effort where we have continuously improved everything that we're doing, where we've had some important wins on fixed income in the last few quarters. And clearly, we can't go into individual client names here because it's not what we do. But we're, I think, at a really important inflection point where we have some pretty significant deals in the pipeline, and those deals are ones which we hope if we can get a few of them done they should have really positive knock-on effects for our credibility in this asset class and then hopefully become kind of a virtuous circle. So I would say that, across the teams, people have never felt more positive than today about what we're doing in fixed income. As you know, this has not been a fast thing. This has been more of an oil tanker than a speed boat. But I really hope, and I think I've got good grounds for believing so, that during the course of this coming year, we should be able to really show that we're making a lot of progress in fixed income and starting to win some pretty serious investors over to our fixed income analytics. So in short, I don't think it's one thing. I think it's a compound over various sub asset classes in fixed income, different types of analytics. So it's what we're doing across the board. And I really do think we're in a great place to have a strong year for 2023 in fixed income.
Craig Huber: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Russell Quelch from Redburn Partners. Russell, please go ahead 
Russell Quelch: Yes, thank you gen. Just wanted to come back to the analytic business to start, can you pin down exactly what's driven the heighten growth in the last couple of quarters? I know you've made a few comments to this already, but is it new products? Is it tech enhancements to existing products? Is it pricing? I'm trying to get a bit of a sense as to, is this structural or cyclical growth. And just kind of linked to that, how does it get decided if climate-related product revenues get booked in ESG and climate or analytics? So I just want to check, there's been no shift in the revenue allocation, which is flattering the growth in the analytics segment?
Henry Fernandez: Look, in some, the analytics product line, we have been revamping their strategy. And the hub on the core is continued work on enterprise risk and performance. And we make some good progress there, but the growth rates are not dramatically different than they were before. The growth areas are in three elements that we're pivoting towards. One is the front office so equity portfolio analytics and fixed income portfolio analytics along the lines of what Baer was mentioning. Those are high growth areas for us. Second is climate risk with Climate Lab Enterprise. And the third area, which we just launched a whole bunch of products, is more content. We launched a protocol insights and the like. And so, we're hoping that the 60% of the run rate, which is central risk, continues to grow at a reasonable pace, but the acceleration of the growth will come from those three pivots that I mentioned.
Andy Wiechmann: And Russell, there's no shifting of run rate from ESG and climate to the analytics segment. There are some climate and ESG focus tools that are analytics tools that are showing up in the segment like our Climate Lab Enterprise and some of our ESG reporting capabilities, but those are not shifting. Those have always been there.
Russell Quelch: Okay, okay thank you. And then just as a short follow-up, the basis point fee charge on the AUM in the Index business that was notably up in Q4 versus Q3 to 2.54. Is that a lagged effect from lower AUM in previous quarters? I'm just wondering, should we expect that to fall again as AUM stays higher in Q1?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, I would say it was impacted by flows out of lower fee products. So there was that mix impact. We saw a very small impact from a positive fee adjustment as well. Despite the steadiness that you've seen over the last year, I do want to underscore that we do expect the average basis points to continue to decline gradually over time. As we've seen over the last, call it, eight to 10 years or so, although we do expect the assets to increase at a faster growth rate and continue to be bullish about the growth in the ETF front. But we do expect fees to gradually come down over time.
Russell Quelch: Got it, thanks so much.
Operator: We have a question from Greg Simpson from BNP Paribas. Greg, please go ahead.
Greg Simpson: Hi, thank you. I think you mentioned price increases being 35% to 40% of new subscription sales firm-wide in the fourth quarter. Could you provide some color around how this compares versus history? Do you get the impression that you're increasing pricing more or less or similar to some of your competitors in Index and ESG?
Andy Wiechmann: Sure yes. I don't want to comment on what our competitors are doing. But I would say that, yes, we are generally increasing prices more than we have in the past. The 35% contribution from pricing to new subscription sales across the subscription base and the 40% plus that we are seeing in Index, the contribution within Index from price increases, those are about five-plus percentage points higher than what we've seen in the recent past. And so yes, price is contributing more than it has in the past. I would just underscore that we are - in our price increases, we are heavily focused on delivering value together with the price increases. And so we're continuing to enhance the content that we deliver to our clients, the capabilities, the functionality and the overall client service that they are getting. We do recognize that our growth is heavily going to come from our existing clients and we want to do it in a constructive fashion. But given the overall pricing environment and cost environment, we are increasing prices more than we have in the past.
Greg Simpson: Great, thank you. And then just quickly on the real estate business. New sales were down year-over-year. Is there anything in particular to call out in what is maybe a trickier backdrop for real estate? And more broadly, how is RCA progressing since your acquisition?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, I mean its similar message to what we've seen in the past, which is things are progressing well in the segment. I would highlight that our - some of our portfolio services are getting a lot of traction and a lot of interest. Investors, in particular, are focused on understanding what is driving the performance and the risk in their portfolios. And so, we're seeing strong engagement there. On the data side, including the RCA data, we do see some pressure from the backdrop, to your point. There are aspects of the RCA business and the data that we have that are used as part of transactions in the real estate space, and we have seen a slowdown in transaction volumes across the space. But you can see the overall growth rate on an organic basis at 12% is still pretty good, and we think there are some environmental impacts going on given the backdrop in the real estate space, but we continue to be quite encouraged about the long-term opportunity there.
Greg Simpson: Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Simon, please go ahead.
Simon Clinch: Hi, everyone thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just get your perspectives, please on, I guess, the opportunity in the futures and options line, which today they're still relatively small in the context of your overall Index business. I mean how should we think about the structural growth opportunity here for that? Obviously, the larger it is, the more diversified benefits you'll see during times of risk. And I imagine that's quite a desirable thing to have? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: Yes, so there are three legs of any large and successful Index business, the active management; the fees that we charge to active managers, what we call the subscription business; the fees that we charge to passive managers, both in any proper ETF or institutional passive or owning some mutual funds. And the third leg is the licensing of indices into all sorts of derivative products. Some of them are lifted like futures and options, and some of them are unlisted such as swaps and options and structured products that investment banks make. We are very, very intent and focused on building that third leg. What you see and that we comment on is the listed futures and options, and there's still a lot of runway for us to continue to grow in new products. We have a lot of listed futures. We're now focused on our listed options franchise and are pushing new initiatives in that front, more to come on that. And while you don't hear us often, although there were comments earlier today on this, is the structured products and the other forms of OTC derivatives. And that is - those are growing very nicely, and there's still the ground floor where we can achieve it.
Simon Clinch: Okay, that's really useful. And then I guess, just lastly, on the environment for M&A and bolt-on acquisitions, could you just give us a sense of how rapidly that's changing? And thus, I guess, just give us a sense of the opportunities you have ahead of you?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, yes. So listen, you know - and you see this on the repurchase front, we are an organization that likes to be contrarian and opportunistic. And so in these environments, there are potentially opportunities to acquire companies that otherwise wouldn't be available. And so, we are seeing some early-stage companies that need growth capital. They're finding that the growth capital is more expensive or tougher to find than it was in the past. And so as a result, they are open to partnerships, investments, even acquisitions in certain instances. And so, we're being very proactive in looking for those opportunities and think they can be instrumental in helping to accelerate those strategic opportunities in our key focus areas that we've talked about in areas like private assets, climate, ESG, fixed income, broader technology and data capabilities. So yes, it's an intense focus for us right now.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to MSCI's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Henry Fernandez. Please go ahead.
Henry Fernandez: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining. As you can hear in our commentary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. We continue to invest significantly in large growth opportunities that are ahead of us and preserve and enhance profitability growth in the company. We're very excited about this momentum, especially in such areas like climate, where we are determined to become the undisputed leader. Thank you, everyone, and we look forward to a continued dialogue with all of you.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead and begin.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Third quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter 2022. This press release, along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today’s presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today’s call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparison and provide insight into our core operating performance. You’ll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run rate, which estimates, at a particular point in time, the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusion, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We therefore caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. We will also discuss organic growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jeremy. Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, MSCI delivered another strong performance despite significant turmoil and dislocation in financial and commodity markets around the world. We posted organic recurring subscription run rate growth at over 14% and adjusted EPS growth of 12.6%. We achieved our best third quarter ever of net new recurring subscription sales growing at 26%. In addition, our retention rate was 96.4% up by a 188 basis points from a year earlier. In terms of capital management, we repurchased another $225 million worth of MSCI shares through October 24. For the year as a whole, our total share repurchases now stand at approximately $1.3 billion. These performance demonstrate a resilient and adaptability of MSCIs all-weather franchise. There is no question that the global economy stated major headwinds. These headwinds have created challenges for all companies including MSCI. Yet, they have also created a massive opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves and to show to both clients and shareholders the power of our all-weather franchise. And moments of extreme volatility and high uncertainty investors become more reliant in high quality data in type of models and weather and research. They want a clear blueprint for navigating choppy waters, MSCIs tools can help them design one. Indeed, our solutions take on even greater importance during periods of elevated global risk. In other words, they face the time when well we do best matters most and we fully intend to demonstrate it. Our third quarter performance show continuous strength across client segment and product line. In Index, we delivered our highest subscription run rate growth in a decade at 12.6%. And deleted future some options trading volume linked to MSCI indices, increased by 21%. In Analytics, we achieved our highest retention rate ever at 95.9%. We also posted subscription run rate growth excluding foreign exchange of 97% in Climate and 35% in ESG ex Climate. All of this numbers illustrate how MSCI is capturing key market trends. At the index in trend continues beyond market capitalization indices, we are meeting investor demand for tools to support more customize and personalized portfolio construction and highly specialized outcomes. Likewise, as global economic pressures accumulate, we have provided the risk analytical tools investors need to stay ahead of the turmoil. Meanwhile, as ESG becomes increasingly mainstream, we are helping investors measure the full scope of sustainability risks, capitalize on sustainability opportunities and achieve sustainability objectives. For all the political noise and controversy around ESG, the simple fact is that sustainability risks are financial risks and will continue to be so. Investors know this, in fact a recent PwC report found that 81% of institutional investors in the U.S. along with 84% in Europe both plan to increase their allocations to ESG products over the next two years in growth. Recent report projected that ESG related assets under management, we have reached nearly $34 trillion globally by 2026 and 84% increase from 2021. And born to underscore that as our ESG product line becomes more diverse with many different use cases and client types, ESG sales growth will naturally fluctuate based on market shifts, difficult conditions and regulatory development. Right now, the world is simultaneously witnessing global energy and food crisis, the largest European war in almost 80 years, the biggest inflation surge in decades, rapidly rising interest rates and COVID lockdowns in China which continue to affect supply chains. At the same time, MSCI remain bullish on ESG long-term potential. If anything, the main factors driving ESG growth and greater environmental and social awareness to demographic shifts we'll become even more powerful in the years ahead. And for Climate specifically, there is no turning back in the rate to net zero emissions. While the global energy crisis has created new obstacles to decarbonization, policy makers continue to embrace bold green investment plans. Moving to U.S., President Biden recently signed a most aggressive climate law in American history. In Europe, governments in active all proposed a wide range of measure that would speed up a low carbon transition. These include more ambitious decarbonization and clean energy targets, policies to maintain or expand nuclear power, and a US$5.4 billion hydrogen project. For our part, MSCI will continue building a robust and dynamic climate franchise. Two climate wins in the third quarter deserve a special attention because they demonstrate our emergence as a leader in this area. Both the California State Teachers' Retirement System, through CalSTRS approve a plan to cut their portfolio emissions in half by 2030. To help them get there, they proposed the lowest a proposal for 20% of their public equity assets to drive the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index. This means CalSTRS will now have nearly $27 billion allocated to track-in that index. State-owned, the New Zealand Super Fund announced that he have moved roughly 40% of this total investment portfolio to track the MSCI World Climate Paris-Aligned Index and the MSCI merger market Climate Paris-Aligned Index. That 40% translates into NZ$25 billion or about US$15 billion. Each win represents a milestone on our Climate journey. As I have frequently said, MSCI aspires to be the number one provider of climate solutions to the global finance and investment industries. We recently published a Net Zero guide for asset owners outlining complete steps for decarbonizing portfolios. We also hosted White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi at our New York offices during Climate Week. That same week, we joined with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero or GFANZ to help launch a proposed climate data public utility. All of these has helped MSCI generate strong momentum doing the run up to COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. In Climate, ESG, Analytics, Index and other area MSCI continues to benefit from our mission critical solutions and diversified client base and our commitment to financial discipline. Right now, many companies are retrenching and turning in work, MSCI is doing quite the opposite. In U.S. we reallocate resources, we continue investing in key differentiators using our Triple-Crown investment framework. More than that, we continue to attract talent and show MP&A opportunities also down on client centricity and reinforce our competitive advantages. All of these will help us emerge even stronger when the current market turmoil subside. And with that, let me turn the call over to Baer. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. And greetings, everyone. As Henry discussed, the world is experiencing historic levels of economic, financial, and geopolitical turmoil simultaneously. Against this backdrop, we see not only big market and foreign exchange swings but also geographic factor sector and asset rotations. At MSCI, our highly diversified product offerings continue to serve us well. For example, the benefits of our non-U.S. dollar expenses have more than offset FX related revenue headwinds. Likewise, the strong performance of our growing index derivative franchise has helped offset some of the pressures related to AUM revenues. As we notes last quarter, MSCI has activated our downturn playbook, which means we continue investing in key differentiators while tightening expenses in less time sensitive areas. This have allowed us to generate attractive financial returns and position ourselves to capitalize on opportunities when they emerge. All of that represents essential context for understanding both our Q3 performance and our strategic priorities moving forward. Henry mentioned a few areas where MSCI delivered especially strong results including Index, Analytics and Climate. In my remarks, I'd like to explore each of these areas in greater depth. In Index, MSCI posted 12% subscription recurring revenue growth. Our highest retention rate in more than three years and our 35th consecutive quarter of double-digits subscription run rate growth. We also achieved market cap subscription run rate growth of a 11%. A key driver of our third quarter Index performance was custom index. MSCI has focused heavily on custom indexes in response to a broader industry trend. More and more investors favored differentiated systematic outcome oriented strategies for which they need to design custom index. Last week for example, we announced the launch of institutional client designed indexes. It will make it easier for asset owners to design customized indexes underpinning their investment strategies. Turning now to our Analytics business. In the third quarter, Analytics posted recurring net new sales growth of 73% with strong numbers across products and client segments. In particular, Analytics achieved robust growth with risk and equity models on the product side and with banks and hedge funds on the client side. At the regional level, Analytics delivered its best run rate growth in the Americas in more than five years. In Analytics as with Index, MSCI solutions helped clients to distill and interpret a huge amount of complex data quickly and efficiently. Last month, we launched a new analytics module known as Risk Insights, which automates many previously burdensome tasks and processes thereby giving clients more time to focus on their analysis. Risk Insights will make it easier for investors to trench more raw data into meaningful useable information with an integrated view of performance and risks. We considered a timely launch in the high levels of market volatility and uncertainty. Finally, just a few comments about Climate and ESG. As Henry mentioned, we posted subscription run rate growth excluding FX of 97% in Climate while also achieving a 97.6% retention rate. Before that last number in perspective, it represented a 456 basis point increase over our climate retention rate a year highly. The largest portion of our run rate Climate Metrics continues to grow at over 60% with exceptional growth in newer areas. For example, MSCI delivered over a 125% growth from Climate value with risks supported by our recently launched total portfolio footprinting solution. In addition, our ESG retention rate increased by 66 basis points to reach 97% overall. In September, we launched a Bloomberg MSCI China ESG Index week which consists of nine separate ESG indexes. Collectively, they represent the first ever Bloomberg MSCI Index week to track both the RMB-denominated bond market and the U.S. dollar denominated Chinese bond market all incorporating ESG and socially responsible investment considerations. Last month, we expanded our index offerings by launching MSCI fixed income climate transition corporate bond indexes whose standards exceed the minimum requirements of the European Union's climate transition benchmark. We continue to see strong growth with our real asset and analytics climate solutions, growing run rate by approximately 250% year-over-year. While our climate index solutions be approximately 80%. We helped to drive additional client progress to our recent minority investment in EVORA Global, a British environmental consultancy. By combining EVORA's proprietary software with MSCIs climate models and indexes, we will further embed climate risk considerations in the real asset investment process. It's a common scene that tied together all these various products and partnerships. Simply put, MSCI is constantly finding new ways to meet the needs and expectations of global investors. We have proven our ability to adapt, innovate, and succeed, even in the most challenging circumstances. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer. And hi, everyone. The strong secular demand for offerings and resilient nature of our business model fuel impressive results across the business. In addition to the 14.2% organic subscription run rate growth this quarter, we experienced double-digit subscription run rate growth excluding FX across all geographic regions as well as across all major client segments. We recorded the highest third quarter ever for new recurring and net new recurring subscription sales increasing an 8% and 24% year-over-year respectively, excluding the acquisition of RCA. Within Index, on top the strength we see within our non-market cap modules, we continue to see remarkable resilience within our market cap index modules which delivered an 11% subscription run rate growth. This has been fueled in large part by tremendous demand within higher growth client segments. Across the index subscription franchise, we saw an 18% subscription run rate growth from broker dealers, hedge funds and wealth managers on top of 10% growth from asset managers and asset owners. Asset based fee revenues experienced declines in the quarter. With ETFs and non-ETF passive fees impacted by declines in global market levels somewhat offset by continued level of elevated volumes in features and options linked to our indexes. ETF linked to MSCI index has experienced marginal net cash sale outflows in the quarter resulting in outflows in broad-based EM exposure funds in all country products, two areas where the broader ETF market was muted. However, we continue to see inflows and high market share capture flows in the fund linked to our equity ESG and Climate indexes which captured $9.5 billion of the $13 billion of total industry flows. Additionally, fixed income ESG and Climate ETF linked to indexes developed with partners and to our proprietary indexes witnessed nearly $7 billion of inflows during the quarter. Revenue from listed features and options linked to MSCI indexes continue to provide a meaningful offset to AUM declines growing 16% year-over-year. This growth has been fueled by elevated volumes that were in line with the last couple of quarters. In Analytics, the strong demand for our tools in our current environment helped drive 8% growth in subscription run rate excluding FX. We had an 11% growth in recurring subscription sales will also experiencing a 35% decline in cancels and highest retention rate of all time in the segment. Recurring net new was up 73% year-over-year. Within the segment, we continue to see strong momentum in front office equity and fixed income portfolio management tools with strength in hedge funds and then helping it drive the growth. Additionally, Analytics continued to gain traction in our climate solutions including Climate Lab Enterprise. In ESG and Climate, we delivered subscription run rate growth a 42% excluding FX, roughly 1/3rd of recurring subscription sales were generated from our climate solutions and the climate run rate across all segments reached $65 million which is an increase of 89% from a year ago. Within our ESG and Climate segments, merging client areas including wealth managers, hedge funds, broker dealers and corporates collectively have run rate growth of more than 60%. We did see a lower level of new recurring subscription sales in the third quarter. On top of changes in the broader market in economic environment which is likely impacting purchasing decisions in some areas, here many layers of growth in our ESG and Climate franchise across a wide range of solutions and use cases which results in a dynamic growth rate that's impacted by the pace of new regulations, client segment dynamics, asset class shifts and geographic factors. Shifts in these layers of growth will drive variations in overall segment growth rate, however we continue to believe in a significant long-term secular opportunities and continued momentum. With real assets, the organic subscription run rate growth was 12% combining our legacy real-estate business and RCA. Given the all-weather dynamics of our financial model and our ability to proactively manage the expense base, we were able to drive adjusted EPS growth of 12.6%. During the quarter, we continue to utilize our downturn playbook by further flexing our expense base to mitigate the impacts of the AUM based headwinds. We are prioritizing key investment areas to address the most critical needs in this challenging environment while meaningfully moderating the pace of hires in less critical and time sensitive areas. Additionally, we continue to flex certain non-compensation expenses in areas like professional fees and we had a slightly lower bonus accrual. In the quarter, revenue had a $12 million FX headwind from an appreciating US dollar. This was more than offset by a $13 million FX benefit resulting from a global expense footprint. Additionally our proactive capital management contributed $0.15 of the adjusted EPS growth as we've now repurchased approximately $1.3 billion of our shares or approximately 2.7 million shares year-to-date. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $867 million of which approximately $600 million is readily available. We continue to be well-positioned to opportunistically pursue bolt-on M&A and share repurchases against this volatile market backdrop. Lastly, I would like to turn to our updated guidance which we published earlier this morning. While we expect continue volatility, our guidance assumes generally flat market levels throughout the balance of the year. As mentioned earlier, we have continued to utilize more levers in our downturn playbook with a focus on moderating our pace of expense growth. Our downturn actions are reflected in our decreased operating and adjusted EBITDA expense guidance. It's worth noting that we remain consistent in our approach that the pace of spend may fluctuate up and down based on the trajectory of our asset based fees, the performance of the business more broadly in the global operating environment. We've modestly increased our range for depreciation and amortization expense mainly reflecting a continued higher level of capitalized software development cost across products. Lastly, we have increased our net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow guidance which reflects the lower than originally projected tax payments and cash expenses in the second half of the year as well as resilient fee in cash collections. We've narrowed our tax guidance which continues to reflect in expectation of the higher rate in Q4 in line with what we saw in Q3. Across the business, we continue to see strong levels of demand for our products which is underscoring the mission critical nature of our tools. We are heavily focused on both driving the attractive runway of long-term growth while protecting the financial model of our all-weather franchise. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Can you just talk about ESG first, can you just -- what decline is specific run rate in the quarter? And if you could just talk about the different pieces of ESG, kind of the growth rate in the franchise in there?
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, hi Manav. Yes, we did throw a number of climate metrics out during the call, so it's probably helpful to summarize them here. I'll start at the top. If we look across MSCI, so across all product lines, we had $65 million of Climate run rate. That was going at 89% year-over-year. If we look at just the subscription portion of the Climate run rate, that was $46 million. And that was growing at a 92%. So, that excluded about $19 million, between $19 million and $20 million of ABF revenue from our Index segment. If we look at the Climate component in our ESG and Climate segment, that's $37 million. And that's growing at 97% ex FXs as Henry and Baer alluded to in their prepared remarks. And so, Climate is becoming a more meaningful component of the overall business. It's clearly contributing a meaningful amount to the overall growth of the segment and the overall company. And we continue to be quite bullish on the prospects more broadly across both Climate and ESG.
Manav Patnaik: Right. And then Andy, and in terms of obviously our retention rates are high as subscription growth is good. And if we enter in certain environment next year, just historically on what time lag or when do you start seeing the first times of some the pressure on those metrics?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I think if you highlighted and we've seen, the retention rates do underscore the fact that our tools are very mission critical to our clients and there in areas of long-term secular growth which is clearly driving some resiliency. And you can see that in not only the overall retention rate but the fact that it's close to record levels across all areas. Although, as you pointed out and I've mentioned in the past, in past downturns, when we've seen a few I'll say to several quarters of sustained market pullbacks, we do tend to see a pickup in client events like fund closures, desk closures, restructurings, mergers, so client evens like that tend to pick up and our largest source of cancels is client events. And so, we are proceeding with caution here. Where we're definitely excited about the high retention rates but given past performance what we've seen in past downturns, we could see a pick-up in cancellations if this environment persists.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead. -- And that looks like Alex's name just connected and so he was being promoted into the queue. We will move to the next question, and that is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking the question. We saw some pretty good improvement on the Analytics front as well. And so, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from a deal pipeline perspective, have you seen any change there, any elongation in the deal, sale cycle. Any color on the momentum in the business? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: Yes, thanks for the question. Look, I don’t think we've seen anything dramatically different to be honest. I think this is consistent with the messaging we've had for some time now. So, I think our level of execution is strong. As Andy mentioned, the retention rate shows the predictability of our products. So, I think we're really in a mindset of letting the numbers speak for themselves and continuing to execute with our strategy. And hopefully, we'll keep moving things in this direction. But there is, I don’t think there has been any really material changes in the outlook. It's more than we're doing a good job, we're enhancing our products, we're servicing our clients, and I think we're getting the results of that.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe, just a quick follow-up on the private asset side. Again, pretty strong momentum there as well I was wondering if you could talk about the RCA, now that that acquisition has anniversary, what have you seen on that front and what else is in line for private assets? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: Sure. Yes, absolutely. So look, we're definitely on plan with the integration and we're pleased with how that's going and we're definitely more convinced that the strategic logic of the acquisition than ever. As you say, the topline is growing attractively. Clearly, the environment for real-estate is going to be interesting in close across the world. And there will definitely be different types of challenges depending on the segments and the country, et cetera. But I think in that environment, it's dramatically in keeping with the comments we've made across the board. Our tools are very necessary for people to understand as whereas in performance and what's happening in the market. So, I think we're in a good situation, we're executing well and the only slight caution there is just the environment which could get a little bit jittery.
Ashish Sabadra: And thanks again. And congrats on solid results.
Operator: Thank you. And next question, we'll move back to Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes, hey guys, thanks. Sorry, my phone turned off in the middle of the question. Great, anyways, sorry if this is was asked already and that I was off. But on the EST and Climate sales, you obviously proactively addressed that and I understand its can be lumpy and obviously at tough comps too. But can you actually talk around about what areas maybe saw outsized weakness in particular this quarter and why. And I know it was a tough quarter and particularly at the end of the quarter with market selling off. So, I was just wondering if there's anything that in particular slipped that may or may pick up again in the fourth quarter. So, any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, sure. Let me try to provide some perspective and I'll give a little bit of color on what we saw in the quarter. I do want to start by underscoring that we remain very bullish on the long-term potential for both Climate and ESG. I think the factors that have been driving the growth will remain powerful in the years ahead. And if you can tell by the Climate growth rates that we mentioned in the prepared remarks and I underscored to an earlier question. We continue to see very strong growth from Climate and expect Climate to be a larger and larger contributor to the overall growth of the segment. Now within ESG, we did have softer sales in the quarter relative to recent quarters. Realistically, there probably is some cyclical impact from the environment in the market backdrop. We saw some deals taking longer to close and we did see fewer large deals in the Q3 figures. We did see slightly higher declines in sales outside the U.S. in AMEA and APAC. Although the run rate growth continues to be quite high across all regions. I think as we touched down in the prepared remarks that you want to underscore that there are so many layers and dimensions to growth in the ESG and Climate which I know Alex you know. But we've got a wide range of solution serving Climate objectives, ESG objectives as well as a wide range of users and use cases. And so there was relative going to be that the growth rate will fluctuate up and down based on pace of new regulations, client segment dynamics, asset class shifts, various geographic factors as well as the market and economic environment. I do want to underscore that there have not been any impacts from U.S. political rhetoric down that's gotten a lot of attention recently. I think generally the focus on ESG and Climate remains front in center to investors globally.
Alex Kramm: Right, helpful. And then, just a very quick follow-up staying actually on the ESG and Climate topic. But if my math is right, since you're now providing some incremental data here, I think that the Climate and ESG portion Analytics is $7 million this quarter. I think very nice increase there. So, can you just remind us exactly what's getting picked up in Analytics now and a new way to think about that the term for that or how penetrated you are. Again, it's a very small number but clearly you've a pretty diverse Analytics customer base. So, just wondering how we should be thinking about those opportunities in particular on that segment? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. And I'd say like in everything we do, our capabilities across segments are symbiotic and synergistic with the other segments. And so within Analytics, we not only benefit from the ESG and Climate franchise that we built, they were also helping to fuel it. And so, within the segment, within Climate in particular, the main offering that we have is our Climate Lab Enterprise which we've released very recently. I believe it was late last year and that has grown that an attractive growth rate although off a very small base. But that is feeding off the broader portfolio and risk management solutions that we offer where when we have a client's portfolio we can now provide very granular climate insights to them about the portfolio, help them manage climate risk more systematically across the portfolio. We also have within the Analytics segment a broader range of reporting solutions. So, we can help clients with things like their TCFD risk sensitivities that they will do as well as help with various other reporting requirements. Analytics does have a very powerful reporting function and capability which we've provided the clients across broader risk insight for quite some time. We're leveraging that to generate climate risk reports as well as broader ESG risk reports and broader ESG reports. And so, those are probably the main areas I would highlight within Analytics. Listen, it's still to your point about term, we're still very early in that journey. Our penetrations relatively small. It's actually extremely small but if we extrapolate across the entire Analytics client base, it can be a massive opportunity. The other thing that's exciting is that really opens up some of the client segments and parts of clients that we haven’t served with the existing Analytics solution. So, it's helping us with insurance companies, it's helping us with banks and bank regulation. And so, there's some big wallets in big markets that we're very excited about on the climate from within Analytics.
Alex Kramm: That's helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And next question will be from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. As usual, you guys have done a great job on expenses. And I know you called out maybe using less professional fees or being able to flex the bonus accrual and also sort of the less time sensitive investments. I guess I think of you guys as really efficient lean organization. I know you not going to cut back on the growth investments that are really meaningful. So, I guess how much room is there on the expense side within the downturn playbook I guess.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So, it's a fair question, Toni. And it's something that we are spending every day thinking about and proactively managing the business. I do want to underscore just to provide some context on the directional moves on the downturn playbook, some of the shifts that have happened since our last quarterly call. So, I think during our Q2 earnings call, we had mentioned that the guidance expense guidance was based on the premise of flat to slightly increasing markets. During Q3, we had the downward impact from market depreciation of over a $100 million on ETF AUM and so the market has come down below what we projected or at least what our guidance was based on during the Q2 call. And as a result, we've begun to take further actions in the downturn playbook. And it's really mostly in the same areas that we were focused on previously just to a larger degree. So, we're further slowing the pace of hires in a broader set of areas, in particular that run the business activities, areas like corporate function. We are continuing to as you mention prioritize hires in really our key growth areas and triple-crown investment areas like ESG and Index, custom Index capabilities, fixed income content and capabilities, key data and technology enhancements, particularly in areas like ESG and in Climate data as well as the broader technological infrastructure and on the cloud. And then we continue to preserve investments in key areas within our go-to markets or sales in client service organization. But we are clamping down harder in the run the business areas and even in selected areas in the broader franchise. You alluded to on the non-comp side, we are squeezing further on professional fees, areas like T&E and recruiting which actually comes down naturally with the pace of hiring. And our comp accrual is lower. We do have further levers to go to, hopefully we don’t have to but clearly based on the comments I just made, there are areas where we can't stop hiring more dramatically. We could cut into the investment portfolio and things like the comp accrual naturally adjust with the direction of the business. And so, there are additional levers out there if we need to go there but hopefully we don’t need to. Generally, we are being cautious, so on our outlook is cautious, which you can tell by our comments and our guidance here.
Baer Pettit: Let me add to that Toni. If you don’t mind, let me add to that. The in addition to all the things that Andy has said, one of the things that we're obsessed with is protecting as much as we can, the new investment plan. And in on therefore what we're doing is squeezing and viewing time-and-time and again on the Run the Business, the normal Run the Business activities to the lower expenses and protect profitability and protect the investment plan. So, if you look back at -- if you move to look back at our budget from the end of last year to renew investments that we were planning to make in 2022, that total investment plan is only off by a couple of million dollars which is an incredible achievement in the context of this difficult environment that we've been able to protect a vast majority of that investment plan. We surely have made some tweaks about reprioritizing that total investment plan but in general we haven’t got it back. And we believe strongly that in down markets that’s where companies slow down their long-term growth because they caught back easily on their investment plans whether than doing the hard work of cutting back on their Run the usual Run the Business they activate.
Toni Kaplan: That makes further sense. Wanted to ask my follow-up on pricing. How is it running this year and what are your plans for '23, are you seeing sort of clients watching spend really closely just given the environment and imagine a lot of those conversations are sort of taking place maybe right now. So, just wanted to understand the outlook for pricing for next year.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I'll talk generally, not specific to any year or point-in-time. But I would say in an environment like this where cost and prices are going up, we are generally increasing prices more than we have in the recent past. Given that our tools are really mission critical to our clients, we do have some pricing power in many parts of the business. Although, as we've mentioned in the past we are very focused on the long-term relationships we have with our clients and recognize that most of our growth is going to come from our existing clients. So, we're heavily focused on adding value in connection with any price increases that we are rolling out. And so, our approach to price increase is more generally is factoring in the value that we're adding to existing services that we're delivering the clients. It does factor in our broader cost structure, the broader cost environment, the broader pricing environment as well as client health and client usage. So, we are being measured and been mindful of the health of our clients but I'd say generally across products, we are rolling out higher price increases than we have in recent years and as a result you're probably seeing some impact of that in the Q3 recurring sales relative to a year ago. And we expect probably similar benefits in the next couple of quarters.
Toni Kaplan: Okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Owen Lau: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. If the market recovers in the fourth quarter, how do you think about your bonus and other non-comp expense which you kind of give back some of their bonus back to employees or you would stick with the downturn playbook because you try to be more conservative. Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. And I don’t want to be too prescriptive here because that really depends on the facts and circumstances. On the bonus point, I would underscore the large majority of the bonus accrual is formulaic. And so it depends on the performance of the business. And so to the extent the business performance increases, in particular of asset based fees run up significantly, that will just trickle through how we accrue our bonus and our bonuses are paid out which is tied to the key financial metrics of the business. And so, the bonus accrue would likely go up. Across broader levers, listen it depends on the exact situation but non comp areas in particular we can flex those pretty quickly up and down where things like professional fees and other non-comp areas can flex up a little bit in pretty short order. The comp lever does take a little bit more time to trickle through and start having impact, that depends on pace of hiring new hires et cetera. But I'd say the bonus and big portions of the non-comp levers that we have can flex in in pretty short order.
Owen Lau: Got it, that's helpful. So, I think you mentioned Climate was strong in this quarter and then options and future trading volume was also strong. Could you please talk about do you see any other product that you see saw a pretty strong demand in the quarter? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: And so, the other area that I would highlight and Baer mentioned is Analytics. And so, I think there has been a component of the strength we saw in Analytic sales that's attributable to focus on our risk models and broader risk management tools in these environments which are critical to or helping our clients navigate in market uncertainty, a lot of that asset class, geographic, sector shifts and rotations that are taking place. And so, that would be another area that I would highlight here. I would also highlight that the extreme resilience of our Index subscription franchise as well and I think there is just such a plethora of use cases across many different users in client segments that continues to be strong pockets of demand and in use cases for those products, particularly in areas like over the counter derivatives that can be very useful to our clients in these types of environments.
Owen Lau: Got it. Thank you, very much.
Operator: Next question is from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi good morning. I wanted to just drill down a little bit more on Climate. And wanted to ask if you're envisioning from here sort of an inflection in terms of the size of the business given the broad-based focus around Climate like other -- is the regulatory environment such that again we may see that type of an inflection. And maybe as you answer that, talk to us about your specific competitive advantages within Climate. I recognize that you have many different areas but curious where you think you're best positioned?
Henry Fernandez: Thanks for that question. As we have previously said, climate change is at complete existential threat to the planet. And we're be we're witnessing a huge increase in physical risk and hid ways and floods and fires and hurricanes and all of that. And therefore, this is going to be a clear and present danger for portfolios of all types around the world because, clearly, the portfolios are made up of equity and fixed income and property and infrastructure and all of that. That will be affected by both the physical risk and the transition risks associated with climate change. So, we're in the very, very early stages of the demand or tools for portfolio managers and portfolio allocators to decarbonize their portfolio and protect their assets from repricing of assets, higher cost of capital, and reallocation of capital. So, this -- we think that this $64 million or so across all of our areas will continue to increase pretty rapidly over the years to come. And we're positioning ourselves not only in terms of the underlying climate data, so just the carbon emission estimates for companies and bond issuers and private companies and real estate exposure and all of that, but also the models, the Value-at-Risk models, the implied temperature rise models to try to help people project into the future what the carbonization path of their -- of the assets and their portfolios are. We're very bullish on this Total Portfolio Footprinting process. Basically, what we do is we take the total portfolio of an asset manager or an asset owner and tell them what the current footprint of carbon emissions of the entire portfolio, Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 and what the trajectory of that footprint will be in the next three to five years or five to 10 years. So, this is -- it's going to be in extremely high demand. I think that the Ukraine war, the -- Putin's war in the Ukraine has highlighted even more so energy security and the dependence on the energy from other sources. And even though in a short-term basis have had enormous increases in fossil fuel prices, every country is thinking about their energy dependence, and the easiest way to achieve energy independence is by wind and solar that is in your own land, in your own country and the like. So, I think we're going to see tremendous -- so yes, there is an inflection point that is happening last year with COP26; this year, with COP27 despite the -- clearly, the balancing act between fossil fuels and renewable energy. 
Faiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much for that. And then just a follow-up maybe for Andy on capital allocation. So, far, it seems sort of share buybacks have been the priority. I'm curious how you think about that in a rising rate environment and how much of a focus is M&A from here? 
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I would say, generally, no major changes to our approach. We continue to be highly focused on both repurchases and opportunistic bolt-on MP&A in key strategic growth areas for us. To your point about the change in funding markets and cost of capital, I would say that we are watching the markets closely, being very mindful of what that means for valuation and trying to be quite opportunistic about where we take advantage on the repurchase front and acquisition front. I'd say given where our gross leverage is and where our funding costs are, we're probably not in a rush to raise additional debt. But we do think we've got a good amount of cash, and we'll continue to build cash to continue to be opportunistic here on both fronts. And we think there are opportunities to get either bolt-on MP&A or repurchases at attractive long-term values.
Faiza Alwy: Got it. Thank you, so much.
Operator: The next question will be from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Craig Huber: Yes, hi. In the past, you guys have talked about how you thought your Climate run rate over time would exceed the rest of ESG run rate. I wanted to ask if you still believe that. And back to the prior question, I wanted to hear a little bit further about sort of the mission-critical tools and data you have on the Climate side that make you guys stand out that your competitors do not have that will help fuel that growth in your Climate area. 
Henry Fernandez: No, great question, Craig. The -- over a 10-year horizon or so, we believe that Climate tools per se, not just Climate in the context of ESG, but I'm talking about Climate tools separately from what's embedded in the ESG offering, will grow at a very large clip and could potentially exceed the run rate of ESG at that time. Obviously, I'm talking about long-term projections here that can vary year-to-year, and it's hard to say where they end up. But the reason we say that is to highlight the Climate tool opportunities, right, the Climate tools, so the Climate solutions by MSCI that's -- because we're paring it against a fairly rapid growth rate on ESG that will continue. And we're saying Climate per se could even exceed that incredible business that we have in ESG. The competitive advantages we have is that, remember, the mission of MSCI is to provide mission-critical tools for the investment and finance industry. So, a lot of our competitors are focused on developing climate data, for example. Some of our competitors are only focused on physical risks. Some other ones are focuses on transition risks. Some of them are only focused on the real estate industry. Some of them are focusing on corporate bonds. What you will find in MSCI is a holistic solution to your entire portfolio from one source, one source of data, one source of models, one source of the total portfolio, whether it's private equities and private credit, which we're doing an incredible amount of work on climate emissions and carbon emissions and things like that. So, I think the benefit -- and you can have that in an index, you could have that in a model, you can have that in individual securities. You can -- and then, as I said, you have across different asset classes and the like. So, I think this is completely in keeping to the way we do on managing MSCI. 
Craig Huber: And Andy, I have a quick housekeeping question. What percent of your costs right now are outside the US? And what percent of those are billed in U.S. dollars? And follow-up question real quick is, what is your organic ex-currency cost growth in the third quarter year-over-year, please? Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. So, the -- yes. And it's a good point. Just taking a step back, we have this nice natural P&L hedge related to FX. So on the revenue side, I believe it's around 11% or 12% of the revenue base is in non-USD currencies. It's about 45% of the cost base is in non-USD currencies. And just given the relative sizes of those bases, the revenue base and cost base as well as the mix of currencies within them, they tend to move in parallel. And so we saw in the current quarter, on the expense side, we had a $13 million -- close to a $13 million benefit from the appreciating U.S. dollar relative to a year ago that more than offset the $12 million headwind we had on the revenue side. And so it's a good example, and you've seen that in recent quarters where we do have this natural P&L hedge where any impact from currency fluctuations on the topline tends to be dampened or offset almost completely by movement on the expense line.
Craig Huber: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi thanks. Good morning. The Analytics business posted a new high in retention rates. Can you unpack the drivers behind the improvement and discuss how high retention rates can go?
Andy Wiechmann: So, yes, I'd say we are encouraged -- really encouraged by the performance in our retention rate in Analytics. I think as I alluded to earlier, there's probably been some benefit from a heightened focus on risk and risk tools in this environment, but we're also seeing success in many of the areas where we've had the strategic focus. And so we've strength in front-office equity and fixed income risk models and broader portfolio management tools. We've been benefiting from our strong models, really best-in-class models and content enhancements that we've been making as well as the broader improved functionality and tech-enabled access that we've been investing in. And then we've had success on the enterprise risk side through the partnerships that we've developed just to deliver a broader value proposition to our clients. And as we talked about earlier, while it's still early days, we're seeing some real momentum in the Climate Lab Enterprise offering. And so we're encouraged, although I would say we are cautious, and we're definitely not ready to declare victory. Analytics will likely continue to experience some lumpiness in not only its growth, but I'd say cancellations within Analytics. So, we're cautious but very much encouraged. Analytics is not only a key strategic capability for us as a firm, but it's also a critical financial area for us. And this performance is encouraging. But also you can see in the margin on the profitability growth, it's been a great source of operating leverage that can help fuel investments in other parts of the company as well.
George Tong: Got it, that's helpful. And then you raised your free cash flow guidance for 2022. Can you walk through the moving pieces there, if that's being driven primarily by lower expenses? Or if there are also working capital and capex benefits?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but it's mainly driven by a few factors. We had a larger-than-projected benefit from lower tax payments in the second half of the year. We've also seen, as you know, a decrease in cash expenses. And then we've had some higher yields on cash, and we've also seen some resiliency in collections. All those factors have helped to offset some of the revenue headwinds that have pressured a bit on the collection side. And so that was the real essence behind the increase in the free cash flow guidance. I would say, like our profitability more generally, our downturn actions also help support our free cash flows and free cash flow growth, and free cash flow is a very important metric that we're very focused intensely on.
George Tong: Great. Thanks for confirming.
Operator: The next question is from Gregory Simpson with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Gregory Simpson: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is in Analytics, the EBITDA margin was 47% this quarter and 44% last quarter. It was more in the 30s historically. So, could you share any colors on the drivers of margin expansion and whether this level of profitability is sustainable in the segment?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, there are several factors that have been driving the margin expansion in Analytics. And I think we've seen similar dynamics in particularly the last quarter. I would note that we have been capitalizing a higher level of expenses related to the development work that we've been doing around things like our Risk Insights and Climate Lab Enterprise and broader enhancements to our analytic capabilities. I would say that FX has a big impact just given the size of the Analytics cost base. The non-USD expense base that I alluded to in a prior question impacts Analytics heavily. So, the appreciating U.S. dollar has helped drive the Analytics expenses down. And then also our downturn actions have impacted the Analytics expense base. And so the confluence of all those factors has driven this really very modest expense growth in Analytics and a higher margin within the segment.
Gregory Simpson: Thank you. And just a follow-up, can you share some thoughts on the potential impacts on MSCI. If we started to see signs of headcount reductions across the asset management industry, how much of the subscriptions are tied to user numbers relative to more enterprise deals with the entire firm? Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Most of our -- I'd say most of our agreements are not tied to users per se. They tend to be modules that are licensed. And it varies very much on product. They tend to be their modules licensed to office location for use of specific products. There can be max users that are allowed to use that license, but they're not tied to seats per se. We also do have some, as you're alluding to, more enterprise-type licensing arrangements. And so seat count is not something that impacts us necessarily directly. Although as I alluded to in my answer to an earlier question, when you start to have more client actions, including investment firms downsizing, closing funds, closing desks, consolidating, that will generally cause an increase in cancellations and a drop in the retention rate. And we've seen those sorts of impacts as downturns are maintained for several quarters in the past, so we are proceeding cautiously although we haven't seen it to this point.
Gregory Simpson: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Russell Quelch from Redburn. Please go ahead. Russell, your line is open, please proceed with your question.
Russell Quelch: Sorry, my headsets seem to be given up, so I'll switch to the phone. Hopefully, you can hear me.
Operator: Yes, we can. Thank you.
Russell Quelch: Thanks very much. So, given the 10% quarter-on-quarter fall in average AUM and ETF tracking MSCI indices in the quarter, I just wondered why did the period-end basis point fee not step up in the quarter? I'm just trying to understand the mechanics there.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. Maybe if you're asking about the run rate basis points, that were quite resilient. So, actually, the run rate basis points have remained constant at 2.52 bps. I'd say there were just very small mix impacts and fee impacts, which resulted in pretty strong resiliency in the fee, which we've seen in recent quarters. And so it's something that is encouraging to us, but I wouldn't flag anything too notable around it.
Russell Quelch: Yes. Just wondering if it should step up when the AUM steps down. That was more the question.
Andy Wiechmann: I see. Yes, yes. Well, listen, we've got a wide range of products out there that are licensed to our indexes under a wide range of agreements with various providers. There was -- to your point, there was some small negative mix impacts on the fee and some very small positive impacts from fee, and those fee impacts were driven by certain products dropping into lower AUM bands where we receive a higher fee. So, there was some embedded impact from that in the fee, but it wasn't significant. I wouldn't overplay that.
Russell Quelch: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then just as a follow-up then. Are you seeing increased competition in the custom index space? And if so, does that change your expectations for growth and investment in that business area?
Baer Pettit: Look, I don't think we're seeing increased competition. I think it's been a competitive market. It's hard to judge precisely. But for sure, we feel our competitive edge is rising. We're putting significant investments into it. And I think this is both -- it's on two levels. It's on strategic client relationships of the kind of winners, those sort of big index wins in Climate that Henry alluded to in his prepared remarks. So, it's understanding the clients' investment process. And it's also the methodology and the skill and the investment process. And finally, it's the technology platform behind that. So, I think in all of those areas, on a relative basis, we're building competitive strength, but it's a very competitive market. So -- but I think we're really focused on it and forging ahead.
Russell Quelch: Great, good stuff. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Henry Fernandez for any closing remarks. 
Henry Fernandez: Well, thank you for joining us today and your continued support. As you can see from the results this quarter and our prepared remarks and the answers to your questions, our all-weather franchise continued to perform well despite a very significantly difficult operating environment. We truly remain excited about the very large opportunities in front of us and we'll continue to invest significantly in those areas of significant strategic growth. Having said that, given the environment, we do remain cautious. And -- but it is in times like this in which MSCI shines. We intend to continue to do so. We look forward to a lot of your questions in the coming days or weeks or months, and please don't hesitate to reach out to our team with any thoughts or questions you have. Thank you very much. Have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-26 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeremy Ulan, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Ulan: Thank you, Vice. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter 2022. This press release, along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today’s presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today’s call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You’ll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run rate, which estimates, at a particular point in time, the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We therefore caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. We will also discuss organic growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me now turn the call over to Baer Pettit. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Hey Jeremy, thank you, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I just wanted to say Henry is fine. He just woke up this morning and was feeling a bit under the weather, so he won’t be joining us on the call today, but we’ll go forward as normal. So before I talk about MSCI’s financial performance, I’d like to formally introduce Jeremy as our new Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Since joining MSCI 12 years ago, he’s held a variety of roles supporting our growth strategy, M&A and partnerships, while building out our planning and forecasting processes. We’re excited to have him in this role. His experience and institutional knowledge will help investors better understand our strategy and opportunities. Looking back on the second quarter, MSCI delivered strong results in a difficult external environment. Among our headline achievements, we posted record levels of second quarter total new recurring subscription sales and net new recurring sales. This helped us drive 14% organic subscription run rate growth, up from 11% a year ago, and also contributed to adjusted EPS growth of 13.5%. Meanwhile, MSCI achieved a 95.5% retention rate, up from 94.4% in the second quarter of 2021. On the capital front, we repurchased another $277 million worth of shares at an average price of $404 per share, bringing our total for the year to nearly $1.1 billion. We also raised $350 million through a term loan, giving us greater flexibility in the months ahead for bolt-on acquisitions and opportunistic share buybacks. We did all this against the backdrop of historic inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and market volatility. As we always say, MSCI prides itself on being an all-weather franchise. Any company can appear successful during a bull market. Moments like this show which companies are truly resilient. Time and again, MSCI has met the challenge. During periods of instability, our data and research become even more relevant. Today, we are well-positioned to capitalize on re-priced assets and help investors navigate financial turbulence. We are also well-positioned to make small bolt-on acquisitions if the right opportunities emerge. MSCI is focused on strategic accelerators, and our team is monitoring the market for possibilities. Even as we continue investing in long-term growth, we will remain vigilant about protecting our profit margins. Despite the macro environment, we have not seen a slowdown in demand for our solutions. In fact, we see continued strength across most segments and geographies. To help us become even more client-centric, we recently hired Cristina Bondolowski as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Cristina brings decades of experience from world-class brands such as Hewlett-Packard and Coca-Cola. Her work at MSCI will deepen our relationships with stakeholders across the Board. Looking ahead, we recognize the challenges posed by global market trends. But as I said earlier, these are the moments when MSCI thrives. I’d now like to drill down into a few areas in greater depth, including Climate, Analytics and Fixed Income. Before I do so, in view of the external environment, I thought it was important to lead with what MSCI is seeing from our clients. Despite all the market turmoil, we continue to have strong growth across client segments. Our pipeline remains robust, and we have no evidence that it is slowing. During this period of economic and financial turbulence, our clients understand that MSCI solutions can play a critical role in helping them adapt and manage their investments. Our second quarter performance confirms the strength of our diversified and durable franchise. Let me spotlight some of the segments and geographies where MSCI recorded especially strong growth. In our Index business, we posted double-digit subscription run rate growth in all regions, along with custom index subscription run rate growth of 23%. In ESG and Climate, we delivered organic subscription run rate growth of 47%, recurring net new sales growth of 26% and our second best quarter ever for recurring sales. Meanwhile, total assets under management in ETFs linked to our ESG indexes increased by 15%. Among banks, hedge funds and wealth managers, we posted total subscription run rate growth of 17%, excluding RCA. In terms of specific products and services, we delivered robust analytics growth with net new sales increasing by 68%. This growth was driven by sales in equity factor models and risk management solutions as well as a 17% reduction in cancels. We also posted a strong retention rate for Analytics of 94% and recurring sales growth of 15%. In addition, our listed Futures & Options trading volume increased by 37%, with strong growth from World, Euro and EAFE contracts. There’s no question that Climate represents one of the fastest-growing parts of our franchise. Let me discuss a few concrete milestones from the second quarter. Just last month, MSCI launched our new total portfolio foot-printing tool, which helps a growing range of financial institutions measure carbon emissions across their lending and investment portfolios. With this tool, we have extended our climate analysis to municipal bonds and securitized products. And we will be better able to provide modeling for loans, infrastructure and private assets. MSCI also completed an agreement with a prominent general partner to provide climate analytics on the portfolio of private companies. In addition, we completed our first Climate Lab Enterprise deal with a major asset manager that cuts across Analytics, ESG and Climate and private assets. The larger pipeline for Climate Lab Enterprise continues to gain momentum. We’re also pleased that one of the most innovative climate tools we launched in 2021, our implied temperature rise metric was named ESG Assessment Tool of the Year for Investment Decisions and Insights by Environmental Finance. To cite one final second quarter milestone, MSCI released the latest iteration of our Net Zero tracker, which illustrates how listed companies align with different temperature rise scenarios. Climate is now driving growth across the company, including in our Analytics business. In the second quarter, MSCI launched a series of new equity factor models, including the first models to offer sustainability, crowding and machine learning factors. The sustainability factor includes both ESG and carbon efficiency components. This is a significant model update aligned with our strong index franchise. We will make these models available through several distribution channels, including Snowflake’s Data Cloud. Using Snowflake will help us dramatically accelerate the client onboarding process. We’re also developing capabilities to create an even better user experience by combining analytical results from Risk Manager and BarraOne. This will greatly enrich our content and capabilities. We are further enhancing the user experience in Analytics through our Investment solutions-as-a-service applications. iSaaS gives clients greater flexibility in how they interact with our Analytics while reducing MSCI’s time to market for new products and services. It represents a pivot away from our legacy applications. All of this reflects our broader focus on client centricity. As part of that focus, we continue to make progress in expanding our direct indexing capabilities. We want to help clients to be able to personalize their investment strategies at scale through client designed index. As I mentioned earlier, MSCI delivered custom index subscription run rate growth of 23% in the second quarter. We were seeing growing traction of custom indexes as the basis of index-linked products within our asset-based fee revenue. We’re also building momentum in Fixed Income. In fact, during the second quarter, our Fixed Income franchise posted 35% growth – run rate growth. MSCI will continue investing in Fixed Income to help our franchise reach the next level. With that in mind, we were delighted to team up with MarketAxess Holdings on innovative portfolio analytics solutions and co-branded Fixed Income Indexes. Through this partnership, MSCI’s Portfolio Analytics and Fixed Income Indexes will integrate the all-to-all pricing developed by MarketAxess, including their credibility and liquidity scores. Meanwhile, investors will use MarketAxess and our ESG ratings to help create more liquid and sustainable Fixed Income portfolios. In closing, I would just like to reiterate that during this period of volatility in financial markets, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. And with that, I will turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer. Good morning, everyone. As Baer highlighted the solid performance during the quarter underscores our strong momentum and the power of our all-weather franchise. In addition to the 14% organic subscription run rate growth, we recorded the highest second quarter ever for recurring subscription sales and net new recurring sales increasing 15% and 26% year-over-year, respectively excluding the acquisition of RCA. And we experienced double digit subscription run rate growth, excluding RCA across all regions with healthy growth across nearly all client segments. In index, we delivered 12% subscription run rate growth, which represents our 34th consecutive quarter of double digit subscription run rate growth. This growth was fueled by 19% subscription run rate growth from broker dealers, hedge funds and wealth managers on top of 10% growth from asset managers and asset owners. Asset-based fee revenue experience declines in the quarter with ETF and non ETF passive fees impacted by declines in market levels, offset by continued growth in our futures and options franchise. ETF's linked to MCI indexes drew more modest net cash in-flows of $7.5 billion in the quarter with flows coming from developed market ex-U.S. and emerging market exposure funds. And within those flows into funds linked to our ESG and climate indexes. It's also worth highlighting that mix shift helped to drive a modest increase sequentially in the period end average basis point fees to 2.52. As we've mentioned previously, our non-ETF passive revenues are recognized on the latest AUM levels reported to us by clients which typically occurs on a one quarter lag. When we receive updated AUM balances from clients, we true up or true down the revenue accrued in the period reported by the client and use the new balance to accrue revenue in the current period based on that, then effective pricing. As clients began reporting lower AUM balances for prior periods during this quarter, our revenue in this quarter reflects some true downs on revenue accrued in prior periods, as well as lower accrual levels for the current period. Despite the headwinds from lower reported AUM balances, we continue to see very strong client demand in new product launches in this area, as well as strong resilience in fees. As a nice offset to the AUM declines, revenue from listed futures and options linked to MCI indexes recorded its highest quarter ever with traded volumes and contracts linked to our indexes up 37% year-over-year. Outside of the asset based fees and index, we saw tremendous strength across most areas. In analytics we drove 15% growth in new recurring subscription sales while also experiencing a 17% decline in cancels, driving net new recurring subscription growth of 68% and organic subscription run rate growth of 7.4%. We continue to see many opportunities and strong momentum in front office equity and fixed income portfolio management alongside our ESG and climate risk solutions. In ESG and climate, we delivered another quarter of exceptional organic growth of close to 50% as Baer mentioned. Roughly half of new recurring subscription sales were generated from emerging client segments, including wealth managers, insurance companies, hedge funds, broker dealers and corporates. And our climate run rate reached $55 million, which is an increase of 88% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of RCA, Real Assets revenues were down year-over-year as a result of foreign exchange impacts and some impact from the timing of revenue recognition. However, organic subscription run rate growth was 9% in our legacy real estate business. Across the firm, it's also worth highlighting the very healthy retention rate of 95.5% which strengths across all segments. Our adjusted EPS growth highlights the power of our all-weather franchise. We flexed our expense base to mitigate the impacts of the AUM-based headwinds. And the headwinds of an appreciating U.S. dollar on our revenues, which were approximately $8 million when compared to Q2 of 2021 were more than offset by FX benefits on our expenses of approximately $9 million. Furthermore, our proactive capital actions provided another lever of support. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased over $1 billion dollars of stock or approximately 2.2 million shares. More broadly, we remain nimble and proactive on the capital allocation front. MSCI's board approved a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend to $1.25 cents per share. Further illustrating our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. In the beginning of June, we opportunistically raised $350 million through term-loan borrowings. With these proceeds, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $842 million of which approximately $600 million is readily available. We remain well positioned to continue to capitalize on share repurchases and bolt-on MP&A opportunities that may arise against this volatile market backdrop. Before we open the call for Q&A, I would like to discuss our outlook for the year. We published our updated guidance earlier this morning, which reflects a cautious but constructive view on the balance of the year. While we expect some continued volatility, we expect generally flat to gradually improving market levels from current levels throughout the balance of the year. As mentioned earlier, we have begun to activate our downturn playbook with a focus on flexing, certain less critical expenses and moderating our pace of hiring in selected areas. We utilize these times of uncertainty to reprioritize our resources and push ourselves to be more efficient across the business in order to free up incremental investment dollars. Our decreased operating expense and adjusted EBITDA expense guidance reflects these actions against our current expectation of relatively flat market levels for the balance of the year. It is worth noting that the pace of spend may fluctuate up and down based on the trajectory of our asset-based fees, the performance of the business more broadly, and the global operating environment outlook. We've modestly increased our range for capitalized expenses as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Mainly reflecting a higher level of capitalized software development costs across products. We increased our interest expense guidance to reflect the variable interest rate payments on the term loan borrowing drawn in June. And lastly we've lowered our net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow guidance as a result of the declines in asset-based fees and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Our tax guidance for the year remains unchanged. For the full year, we expect to drive continued high 50% margins on a consolidated basis, which is in line with our long-term target. Across the business, we continue to see strong levels of demand for our products. And we have conviction in the secular growth opportunities in front of us. We remain focused on executing on our strategic growth opportunities, but we will continue to protect the financial model of our all-weather franchise. And with that operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Andy, I was hoping, just your comments on activating the downturn playbook. I was just hoping you could give us some specific examples, perhaps, where you're starting to see some of this weakness in which segments, is it the banks where you're starting to hear like layoff chatter or I was just hoping you could flush that out a bit? I understand why you're doing it, but just was hoping to some color on which areas perhaps you're seeing some of this weakness right now?
Baer Pettit: Manav, it's Baer here. Maybe before I turn it over to Andy, I just wanted to make a clarifying point. The downturn playbook relates more to a series of financial actions that we take in order to be prudent and to ensure that we don't provide any negative surprises to our shareholders. So it doesn't – it's not conducive necessarily in a strict sense to us seeing any sort of negatives in our pipeline or what's happening. It's just that in view of clearly the market beta effects and how that affects our ABF revenues and that can be seen, and all of you can measure that. But I think more broadly, we're not seeing anything particularly negative. I hope that was reflected in our prepared remarks. But I'll just also turn it over to Andy to speak a little bit more specifically about those measures we're taking to be financially prudent.
Andy Wiechmann: Yeah. To Baer’s point, this was the actions that we're taking are related to the pullback in ABF revenues. We mentioned last quarter that if AUM stayed at current levels at the time or deteriorated further, we would likely go to our downturn playbook from the end of Q1 to the end of Q2, we saw AUM levels drop about $200 billion or 14%. And as I mentioned, our guidance at the time, assumed markets remained fairly flat. And so as a result, we're turning to our downturn playbook. Just to give you some color on some of the levers that we've been flexing here. We are moderating the pace of headcount growth on a very targeted basis. And so we are prioritizing our key investment areas to continue investing in, but other areas we are slowing down the pace of growth. We're also identifying efficiencies in less critical areas. We are selectively flexing down some of our discretionary non-comp areas around areas like professional fees. Obviously you're aware we are getting some meaningful FX benefits, which feed into the lower expenses as well. And then it is worth noting, we are projecting a slightly lower comp accrual relative to our original forecast. But to Baer's point, I do want to highlight that our business remains healthy, client buying behavior remains generally healthy despite the lower ETF, AUM levels. And it's important to keep in mind that we have a global diversified all-weather franchise with a very strong subscription growth and retention rate here.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then, maybe can you just talk about, you guys have a strong balance sheet, but just your thoughts on accelerating, maybe some MP&A that you guys typically do, like just other valuations down and off in the private market as well?
Andy Wiechmann: Yeah. So I mean, part of the rationale for raising the term loan, the additional $350 million was to give us dry powder. We want to continue to be nimble on the share repurchase front. We think there are opportunities to get our shares attractive values, but we also want to have some dry powder for bolt-on MP&A. And so we've started to see some repricing in private companies. I would say generally, especially in the spaces we operate, they haven't adjusted to the levels of public companies. And so we do think there could be some continued compression in private company values. There's also a degree of time, related to private company owners adjusting to the new norm before they decide to sell. And so we do think if this market volatility persists in the market, public company valuations remain low. In the coming quarters, there could be some opportunities that we want to be poised to capitalize on. And as always we're focused on strategic accelerators, as Baer said, focused on our core investment areas like ESG and private assets, and fixed income and the areas of unique content that will enhance our existing franchise.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yeah. Hey guys I guess strong sales during the quarter, and I think the pipeline commentary also pretty constructive, just wondering, given that this quarter, the 2Q queue was basically deteriorated throughout. Just wondering if how the progression was on the sales side. Did you see any differences as the quarter went down or was it all fairly consistent and then maybe any other, any particular color by customer sets, as again as the quarter was maybe a tale of many stories?
Andy Wiechmann: Yeah. Hey Alex, good morning. Look, honestly, we really haven't seen any sort of mark change from the beginning to the end of the quarter. We actually had a very strong end of the quarter in terms of closing business. We've started the present quarter as we would hope to do so, as far as we can see at present, we have no information to suggest things are turning into a negative direction. Look, it's a choppy environment and things could change, but as of today we have no empirical evidence that things are trending in a worse direction.
Alex Kramm: All right. Great. Fair enough. Second question then, and I think I asked this either one or two quarters ago, but I think it remains relevant, which is on the ESG noise that's out there. Somebody said to me the other day, not a day goes by without a negative article on ESG. And it seems like in election year, this is even turning into a partisan issue. So just wondering what this has done to your client conversations to your sales pipeline. I mean, is this having an impact or is this just noise that us on the outside maybe are getting wrapped up in, but it really doesn't matter to the end clients and then demand?
Baer Pettit: Sure. So Alex, first of all, as you well know, we're a global franchise. So I think the debate you're referring to is primarily in the United States and is not really happening to the same degree in other geographies. And then I think the second point, which is much more important is, you need facts and information to engage in that debate, right? So I think the point that I also have made repeatedly on this topic in the past is what people cannot afford to do is ignore the topic. There may be certain parties who I think are in a minority or a small minority, depending on where you are, who feel that this is in quotes, not a good use of their time, but even they need the – they need data and information to make their case on. And I think the key part of this franchise is that all parts of the debate need information to make judgements and I think that that benefits us across the board.
Alex Kramm: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. Thank you. Wanted to start on the custom index side. I think Baer, you mentioned that you've seen sort of an acceleration in this area. Are you guys able to size that for us right now? And is this an acceleration in growth because it's off of a smaller base or is this a structural long-term growth driver for the index business?
Baer Pettit: The custom indexes have been a structural long term growth driver for the index for some time. And I hope I'm not speaking out of school, but the data is pretty clear in my head, that the growth rate has always been pretty healthy. But the healthy growth rate such as the one that we had in the past quarter, my definition is coming always off a higher base, right? So it is a long term story. It's still a very strong trend. And we're seeing first of all, that the demand for complexity with different types of content even, different asset classes which we hope to do more of has increased, so that plays to our strengths. But also we're seeing that this demand, which was a – going back in time, chiefly institutional is spreading increasingly to wealth management and notably, we're investing in direct indexing, as I mentioned in my comments. So we think that the combination of institutional demand, general financial products demand and the rising demand for direct indexing and wealth will continue to provide a lot of momentum to this area for us.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. And I was hoping you could give us an update on regulation, both within the index space and the ESG parts of your business as well. Are you seeing more of a tick-up in regulation or regulator scrutiny, just wanted to get an update there?
Baer Pettit: Sure. I'm happy to take that. So just as a reminder, we are regulated in the EU – under the EU BMR actually currently through the FCA in the UK. So that's something of some standing, so we're familiar with that. There's the – so just continuing on index regulation, there have been greater interest in this topic from regulators in the United States. I won't speculate on where that will end up or the direction of it, but clearly the interest of regulators in the United States has picked up. But I'm confident that in whatever direction that goes, the manner that we operate, the quality, the transparency the separation of powers between editorial and commercial, all those things, I think we're very well prepared for it. In ESG also, as a reminder, we are a registered investment advisor in the U.S., and we're not the LLC that owns ESG ratings. That clearly has been an area that has not been heavily regulated for us historically. It may be further regulated in the future and there's also a lot of initiatives, Europe related ESG regulation. And I'd make the same observation, while what we are – we always work on the assumption that someone may come and regulate us. And so the quality of what we do, the transparency of what we do is foremost in our mind. That’s how we’re operating in our ESG ratings. And we’re confident if we do so, we continue to invest and ensure the highest quality that if regulation comes, we may well benefit from it because of the high standards we have.
Toni Kaplan: Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Toni.
Operator: The next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. AUM dropped about 14% between 1Q and 2Q. And I believe you mentioned your guidance assumes flat market levels over the balance of the year. Can you elaborate on your thinking there? And what your guidance assumes for AUM levels on a full year basis?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. I don’t want to be more prescriptive than the commentary that I made and you alluded to. But in our trajectory of spending, we make assumptions about the market. And as I alluded to, we’ve assumed that the market levels remain relatively flat to where they are today to slightly improve. And so that’s kind of the environment that we based our spending assumptions are then feed into our EBITDA expense and operating expense guidance.
George Tong: Right. And on a full year basis, that assumes what for AUM levels and perhaps on flows?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. You can do a little bit of the math yourself, just seeing what’s happened for the first six months of the year and average AUM balances there, with that color that I just provided. I don’t want to provide more specific assumptions around AUM flows or fees or any of those factors, which we typically don’t comment on.
George Tong: Got it. Okay. And then as a follow-up, you’re exercising your downturn playbook with the expense reductions. What does your downturn playbook imply for margins? Are you committing to hold margins at a certain level for this year?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. We’re not committing to margins. I did make the comment in my prepared remarks that we are targeting or we believe our margin for the year will be in the high 50s, which is aligned with our long-term targets. The margin can fluctuate quite a bit based on a number of factors, including big moves in AUM, FX rate fluctuations, other one-off items. So it’s not a guidance or target, but we are looking at the margin being in the high 50s for the year, which is worth noting. And if you look at the expense guidance, it does imply that our expenses are picking up slightly in Q3 and Q4 relative to what we saw in Q2.
George Tong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn. Please go ahead.
Russell Quelch: Yes. Thanks, guys. So I just want to go back to the ESG and Climate business on the back of what Alex was saying. And I noted that the new subscription sales growth has been strong again this quarter. Wondered if you could talk to what’s driving this? Is it the upsell of new products? Or is it new customer penetration sort of leveraging traditional products? And also sort of how sustainable is the current level of sales growth? Do you think that the speed of the margin expansion in this business will slow? And what the sort of long-term margin target for this business might be? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: So look, I’ll make a few observations, and then turn it over to Andy if he wants to comment on the margin or not. So look, as regards to the main question, I think it’s all of the above and more of the same, right? I think it’s the same as last quarter in a positive sense. 50% of our sales in the quarter were from new clients, new clients to this product line and then that’ll be new clients to the firm. So I think in terms of both the range of what we are selling, the client types, the number of new clients, everything looks really healthy. So rather than speculate as to what rate will – how long it will go on, the way I would say it is we have no suggestion that what – that this – that what occurred this quarter that will have any no less good a quarter, next quarter as we had done in the previous quarter. So I just feel like we’re in a strong position with this product line. And if that were to no longer be the case, we would communicate it, but we’re really doing well now. So Andy, I don’t know if you want to comment on the margin at all or...
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. Obviously, we don’t give margin targets by segment, but I would say that within the ESG and Climate, our focus is really on driving top line growth, not margin expansion. And so we’re not targeting for the margin to expand from current levels. We’re really trying to invest to continue to fuel that growth that you’re asking about across so many different dimensions. So the client segment dimensions, the asset class dimensions, the solutions dimensions and then really, really accelerating our growth in Climate, which we think is going to be a massive opportunity. And so our goal right now is leadership and growth. It’s not on margin expansion within the segment. I would highlight that longer-term, the nature of what we do in ESG and Climate is similar to what we do across many other product areas, which is we develop IP and we sell it many different – to many different clients for many different use cases across many different applications. And so it inherently does have attractive operating leverage, but we’re really reinvesting that operating leverage in growth and investment.
Russell Quelch: Okay. Good stuff. And then sorry, just as a follow-up. In respect to the Analytics business, the run rate there is still circa 5% and never a pickup. I wondered if you could talk in a bit of detail about what’s being done to improve that. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. Actually, sorry, you broke up a little bit.
Baer Pettit: Yes.
Andy Wiechmann: Do you mind repeating the question?
Russell Quelch: Yes, sorry. Just in the Analytics business, the run rate, it’s still growing at around about 5%. There’s never a pickup in the run rate growth. So I just wanted to know what’s being done to improve that. Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. Yes. So we’re focused as much on the run rate growth, which was 7.4%, which is still not quite where we want it to be. We do believe this is a high single-digit growth segment for us, but definitely higher than the revenue growth. There tends to be some noise around revenue growth related to timing of implementations, revenue recognition around contracts. Just consistent with what we’ve discussed in the past, there is lumpiness. I would say the encouraging thing for us on Analytics is the strength in the quarter was aligned with our strategic areas of focus within Analytics. So we saw a strong equity portfolio management growth of high-single digits. We continue to see elevated growth within our fixed income portfolio management tools. And we continue to get or we started to get some traction around ERP, which is the area that’s had lower growth in the past. So we got a nice boost from our 18f reporting solution to support a new regulation going into effect in August. We got traction, as we highlighted with Climate Lab Enterprise sales, which are booked within our Analytics segment or partially booked within our Analytics segment. And we also are getting traction with our partnership approach, which is accelerated by some of the investments and advancements we’ve made on the ISaaS front. And so it’s not where we want it to be, but we do think we’ve got the right strategy and hope to continue the momentum, although I would say, it will be lumpy. It’s also worth highlighting that in addition to the strategic benefits that Analytics gives to the rest of the organization, Analytics has also been a nice source of operating leverage, which you can see from the results this quarter, which is really helping to fund investment in other parts of the company.
Russell Quelch: Okay. Great stuff. Yes. Thanks, Andy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead. Craig, if your line muted.
Baer Pettit: Craig, you may be muted. Yes. I can’t hear you, Craig. Maybe we can move to the next caller and then come back to Craig. He’s having a technical problem.
Operator: Okay. All right. So let’s move on to the next question, which comes from Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. How are you guys thinking about pricing power right now? Obviously, it’s an inflationary environment, but at the same time, your asset management clients are seeing their AUM under pressure.
Baer Pettit: Yes. So look, I would say that our philosophy on pricing is very consistent, which is that we always try to be as firm as we can without giving our clients the impression that we’re being too aggressive. So I think that we’ve managed to put in sort of a slightly above average increase in our index sort of a regular price increase, but it’s not notably different. We’re very focused right now on ensuring, as we have been for a number of years, that we have – we’re getting the right value out of Analytics, and that could be reflected in some of the numbers here. And in terms of clearly the big growth drivers in ESG and Climate, those are fairly young products as it were. So it’s mostly coming from new clients and new products rather than price increases. But I would say that as a general observation leading to – linked to your observation about the state of our clients, we’re not hearing negative noise about that. And – but we are conscious that we look work in a competitive environment and that we always have, as I said, an outset, a philosophy in balancing economic strength with not pushing our clients too far.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Got it. Thank you. And then Andy, can you quantify the magnitude of the true down that you spoke about in the non-ETF passive asset-based fees?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. It’s – I know it’s an area that probably a lot of folks missed or underestimated. I would say, it can be on the order of magnitude of a few million dollars, depending on how significant the market moves are. I would mention that, depending on what happens with the markets, we could see this dynamic at play in our revenue in Q3 as well, with similar adjustments as we start to receive the Q2 AUM balances from our clients.
Patrick O’Shaughnessy: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregory Simpson with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Gregory Simpson: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask if you had any color on the revenue contribution from private markets beyond the more legacy real estate piece and RCA? It sounds like there’s quite a lot of work on the product side and building out relationships with GPs. But are we at the stage yet where kind of private equity clients are a more material segment? Just how things are kind of going there and then the relationship with the Burgiss.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. Yes. So maybe I can comment on the real estate performance, and then, Baer, if you want to make any comments around Burgiss specifically, which we don’t obviously consolidate Burgiss as we are a minority investor in them, but we continue to work on the product development front. But within real estate, before I touch on RCA, I do want to highlight – provide some color around the performance of the segment. I know there was a lot of noise around it. I would say, the revenue growth is more reflection of accounting and FX than business health. I think operating metrics are fine and organic subscription run rate growth within our legacy real estate business with 9%. And for RCA, to your question, we continue to see double-digit run rate growth within RCA. And you can see the retention rate is quite strong at 96% within the segment. And so we continue to execute to make progress in our ambitions around RCA. And we are really starting to see the – not only the operational synergies, but the strategic synergies of cross-selling to our clients, new product development, continuing to expand the suite of indexes and content as well as climate solutions that we had planned to do when we acquired the company. I don’t know, Baer, do you want to make any comments around Burgiss?
Baer Pettit: Look, I’ll be very brief. I think we’re working with them on a number of areas. We’ve clearly had alluded to some of the climate work that we’re doing. That’s been a big focus of ours, because this demand is coming through for increasingly from private asset clients. So there’s also general work going on between our private asset data teams in order to figure out how we can create greater benefits in combined products going beyond some of the ESG and climate work that we’re doing. So I hope as we get into the second half of the year, we’ll be able to expand on that a bit more for you.
Gregory Simpson: Great. And as a follow-up, can I check on how the product relationship with the Hong Kong Exchange is going? I think volumes in the China A 50 contract maybe still a little bit on the low side, but a big opportunity longer term. Are there any kind of lessons from the other exchanges about how long it takes for volumes to really accelerate perhaps?
Baer Pettit: Yes. Look, I think we’re very happy with the relationship. I’ve personally been involved in a number of calls with them in the last quarter. I think that as you can see from other aspects of our Futures franchise. These things are a virtuous circle that kind of volume and liquidity and open interest to get one another. I think we’re happy with where we are. We’ve got some other things that we’re discussing with them. So I think we’re in a good place. And we believe that looking across our – the broader numbers in our Futures & Options franchise, which you saw this quarter, there’s still a lot of upside across the board with all of our exchange partners, including Hong Kong.
Gregory Simpson: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Craig Huber: I apologize. Can you size for us, if you would, your Fixed Income run rate revenues now and maybe also your wealth management run rate?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. Craig, I don’t think we’ve provided those metrics recently. I would say that there are a couple of ways to think about our Fixed Income business. We’ve got the direct fixed income solutions that we provide for the fixed income investment process, and those cut across Index with our Fixed Income Indexes, which is largely on the heels of our partnerships that we have with many other major index providers, fixed income index providers or ESG solutions, which are increasingly being incorporated into the fixed income investment process. And then our Analytics solutions, which I alluded to earlier has been a nice area of growth for us in Analytics. It is worth noting, we also have a meaningful Fixed Income capability that serves multi-asset class use cases. As part of our multi-asset class tools and our enterprise risk and performance, obviously, a big part of our clients’ portfolio is – their enterprise-wide portfolio is fixed income. And so we have capabilities there that are critical to supporting the growth and the position in those businesses as well. And so it cuts across a number of dimensions, but it is – especially the one – the parts serving the front office and that fixed income investment process, we are seeing very strong growth.
Baer Pettit: Yes. And I’d just make an additional observation on top of what Andy said. This cross-product line team, two observations. This is how we’re operating more and more across MSCI, using the phrase one MSCI we’ve used in the past. And in particular, in Fixed Income, the expertise we have across the firm is really coalescing that team had – across all products and functions at an off-site literally in the last week. So I think there’s a lot of momentum behind what we’re doing. And it’s sometimes tricky reporting as a public company across different product lines. So we’ll continue to try to provide you guys with as much transparency as we can there.
Craig Huber: And then my follow-up question, guys. Your private asset segment, obviously, organic FX was down about 5.5%. You talked about some onetime issues there. Can you just talk a little bit about your outlook there? And if you normalize for that, what was sort of the underlying growth rate?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. So let me actually provide a little bit more color there. So as you alluded to, I mentioned there was some noise on the revenue side, where our revenue in real assets, firstly, has a relatively large exposure to non-USD currencies. And so the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound, generated some revenue headwinds from an FX standpoint. Additionally, within our legacy real estate business, for some of our offerings, we’ve been transitioning our clients to a service model where we recognize revenue evenly throughout the year versus, if you remember in the past, we had a good chunk of revenue where we recognized our revenue upon delivery of a service. And a good chunk of the revenue would be recognized in the second quarter, which is when we would do a number of the deliveries. And so from a year-over-year comparison standpoint, as we’ve migrated many clients to the – even subscription model through the year, you see some headwinds in the growth. But more generally, I think we’re committed to the long-term targets that we’ve put out there at the high teens level, and we continue to be bullish about the prospects across our legacy business, the RCA business as well as the combined organization.
Craig Huber: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go to the Slide 28, where you provide the AUMs and ETF linked to ESG and Climate equity indices. The growth moderated there a bit and even sequentially, there was a moderation. I just wanted to see how much of it was related to just market performance. And what are you seeing in terms of new ETF launches or new product launches based on the ESG and Climate equity indices? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Yes. So look, as Andy mentioned before, we are close to speculate or to be – to about the exact direction of what will happen with markets and products, particularly in this environment. But we’ve – as I mentioned in my comments, growth in ESG and Climate category of indexes has been very attractive. Even in this tough market, we continue to be in conversations with many key clients about launching new products. So I think we – the direction of travel continues to be what it has been. And we have nothing to suggest so far that there is a lack of interest in this type of products. I don’t know, Andy, if you have anything to add to that in terms of numbers or…
Andy Wiechmann: No. No, I think you hit the key themes there. I think that’s right. We continue to see momentum and strong appetite as Baer has highlighted across the category. There are cyclical dynamics feeding into some of the flows, particularly within ETFs. And so it’s something that we’re not too concerned about looking out longer term.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful color. And maybe just as my follow-up, I was going to ask about the appointment of Christina as the new Chief Marketing Officer and the focus on a more client-centric approach. I was just wondering, as we think about the marketing strategy, should we expect any change to the marketing strategy there? Or even on the execution front, if you could provide some color on some of the new initiatives that might get planned for the rest of the year or going into 2023? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Sure. Great question. So first of all, I’m delighted that Christina has joined us. And I think we’re at an inflection point or we’re probably past an inflection point, where MSCI needs to reach out to our clients in the broader markets, moving beyond our traditional strengths of what I would call direct sales and client service. And Christina has an outstanding background to help us in that regard. And I’m very confident that she will put her leadership footprint on this area, and we’ll be happy to talk about that in the quarters ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Jeremy Ulan: Okay. I believe that was the final question.
Operator: Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Baer Pettit for any closing remarks. Go ahead.
Baer Pettit: So thank you all for joining us on the call today and your continued interest in MSCI. As you heard, it’s times like these that really underscore the resilience of MSCI’s all-weather franchise. We not only continue to see strong demand for our solutions, but we also have tremendous opportunities in front of us. We remain excited about the momentum we are building and the investments we’re making. And we look forward to seeing and engaging with all of you in the coming months. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-26 11:00:00) =====
Company Representatives: Henry Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Baer Pettit - President, Chief Operating Officer Andy Wiechmann - Chief Financial Officer Jisoo Suh - Executive Director, Investor Relations
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question and one follow up. We will have further instructions for you at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jisoo Suh, Executive Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Jisoo Suh: Thank you, Dillon. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter 2022. This press release along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call, as well as a brief quarterly update are available on our website www.msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time, the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We therefore caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. Additionally, we will discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media maybe on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Jisoo. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. Apologies for my scratchy voice and a little bit of coughing. Before I talk about – yep, can you all hear me? Okay, thank you Jisoo. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. Apologize for my scratchy voice and a little bit of coughing.  Before I talk about MSCI financial performance, I just want to say that our hearts go out to the people of Ukraine, who are suffering through one of the worst humanitarian tragedies in Europe since 1945. My sincere hope is that the world will ultimately emerge stronger from this crisis, with a deeper respect for self-determination, national sovereignty and human rights, and a clearly sense of purpose among the liberal democracies of the world. The war has certainly put everything else in greater perspective for many of us.  In the first quarter, MSCI delivered strong results that highlight both, the strong resilience and long term potential of our all-weather franchise. Not only are our solutions helping clients navigate market volatility and asset rotations, they are also helping them understand major structural changes in the global economy and the financial markets. Those changes include the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, rise in interest rates, elevated inflation and the needed transition to a low carbon economy. During a period of historic geopolitical and economic turmoil, MSCI Solutions have become increasingly more valuable to plan across the whole global investment industry.  To put our first quarter results in perspective, we posted our best first quarter on record for both new and net new recurring subscription sales. We achieved organic subscription run rate growth of about 14% and nearly a 96% retention rate. Our adjusted EPS topped 21%, and we repurchased almost $800 million worth of MSCI shares.  Of course the biggest global event of the quarter was Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. MSCI responded immediately, providing essential support to our colleagues in the region, and donating to key relief organizations. We made necessary adjustments to our existing products and business ties, including swift changes to our indices, while also developing new products, services and insightful research to capture the new global landscape.  All of this demonstrated once again how fast and nimble MSCI can adapt to an unexpected global crisis. Our resilience and momentum have allows us to continue driving growth despite the uncertain environment. Indeed, we are finding innovative ways to grow both inside and outside our traditional client base. For example, our traditional client base of asset managers and asset owners collectively delivered subscription run rate growth of 11% in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions. So far this year we have already seen more than $2 billion worth of incremental AUM from new mandates benchmarked to the MSCI, Climate Paris aligned indexes by asset owners in APAC and in EMEA.  We are also driving strategic benchmark wins with asset managers who are licensing custom indexes they have designed using MSCI's New Index Builder Application. We have on-boarded about 18 clients on to the Index Builder Platform already. At the same time, we keep adding new layers of growth in areas such as fixed income, ESG and climate, and private asset.  This quarter our ESG and Climate retention rate hit an all-time high of 98.7%. We also recorded our second best quarter ever for new ESG and Climate subscription sales. This data point tells us two things; first, ESG continues to become increasingly embedded in the global investing process. Second, our clients recognize the value that MSCI, ESG and Climate offering can provide. We continue to work to position MSCI as a leading provider of climate solutions and a standard setter.  As of the first quarter we’ve calculated implied temperature rise metrics for more than 10,000 issuers and nearly 134,000 funds. The implied temperature rise metric computes how the carbon emissions of companies and portfolios align or do not align with different global temperature pathways such as 1.5°C or 2°C increases.  Like all of our solutions, MSCI Climate products run on data. To give our clients a truly comprehensive and transparent view of the investment opportunity set, we are transforming the way we collect, clean and build data across global clients and asset classes.  As I mentioned back in January, MSCI has always been a data processing factory. Now, we are also becoming a date building machine. During moments of global uncertainty and disruptions, high quality data becomes even more valuable as investors try to understand the present and imagine the future. MSCI also continuously looks to the future to reinvent itself, including with respect to our organizational structure and agility.  As previously announced, we made a number of senior leadership changes at the start of the year to support our ever evolving business needs. These changes position us well for increased growth in the years to come. Likewise, our first quarter performance reflects the long term investments we have made to build a durable, diversified, all-weather franchise. While external conditions make it more difficult, our fundamentals remain very strong. As we have proven, MSCI can deliver impressive results in every type of operating environment. This is what we mean by an all-weather franchise.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Baer. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry and greetings everyone! As Henry mentioned, the biggest global event of the quarter was Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I join him in expressing our solidarity with the Ukrainian people. When the war began, MSCI quickly removed Russia from our emerging market indexes and reclassified it as a standalone index. We have also introduced new stress test scenarios specific to the war that client's run though our analytics products. Additionally, we closed out our deminimis financial exposure to clients in Russia, which is lesser than that $1 million of run rate.  We are well positioned to succeed in the complex external environment, thanks to our resilient all-weather franchise. Despite the current turmoil, we remain convinced that long term trends benefiting MSCI, including the indexation and globalization of portfolios will endure. In my comments today, I will review the areas of our business where we will continue investing for long term growth as reinforced by strong financial results and a few examples of our actions to manage risks that we can control.  I'll start with our continued momentum in scaling our ESG and Climate franchise. Even as we enter a period of surging energy prices and user technology sector valuations, demand for integrating ESG and Climate considerations is resilient as clients continue to position themselves for long term transformation.  Our firm wide ESG and Climate run rate is now $369 million, growing 46% year-over-year. In our reportable ESG and Climate ratings and research segment, new client relationships continue to form almost 50% of new subscription sales.  Our multi-year investments to build a large and complete data coverage universe are supporting our position as an industry standard setter. In ESG ratings and in our Climate metrics, we now cover more than 9.5 million instruments across equities and fixed income, including ETF’s, corporate and government bonds, bank loans and derivatives.  Next, I will discuss our progress in scaling our newer frontier client segments. In the ESG and climate segment, over half of new subscription sales during the quarter were to wealth managers, hedge funds, broker dealers, corporates and insurance firms. These clients have diverse use cases for MSCI Solutions, such as Climate Stress Testing on their loan books, enhancing underwriting processes by better understanding counterparties ESG and carbon profiles, complying with new and emerging regulations and monitoring of net zero commitments.  We are also leading into the connectivity across MSCI product lines to drive wins with these newer clients. Our strong first quarter sales included an EMEA insurance firm that launched insurance linked products, benchmarked to our custom indexes with a partner in fixed income.  Across MSCI, our total run rate from insurance firms and all-insurance related use cases is $77 million, growing 19% year-over-year. In analytics we're landing strategic mandates with equity and fixed income portfolio managers, seeking to integrate ESG in portfolio construction process. Our run rate in analytics fixed income front office has grown approximately 50% year-over-year.  Finally, we continue advancing our data ecosystem to equip our clients with the insights they need to understand the impact of today's macro backdrop on their portfolios. In analytics, we released an enhanced version of Climate Lab enterprise during the quarter, with dedicated dashboards related to carbon intensity. While it's still early days, we see climate data as a sales enabler for various portfolio construction reporting and risk management used case, and we are encourage by a recent large multi-year client win in the Americas.  In private assets, we also expect climate data to be a commercial enable, including for cross sales. We recently completed a product release of our Client value-at-risk due-diligence reports to RCA’s large commercial real-estate property data base.  In ESG ratings, our investments in our issuer communication portal are enabling a higher velocity of engagement with corporate issuers, which is in turn further supporting data quality and timeliness. Our previously announced launch of MSCI data explorer places over 250 data sets across all MSCI product lines at our clients’ fingertips. This is empowering them to self-service and discover, test and start new subscriptions.  Across MSCI our pipelines are healthy. Having said that, we are watching economic activity across regions closely and the effects on our clients, which we recognize maybe uneven. In summary, our resilient franchise continues to benefit from our actions and long term investments to diversify and enrich our platform. Across varying and unpredictable operating environments, we are committed to driving continued growth in the most efficient way possible, prudently for all our stakeholders.  Let me now turn the call over to Andy. 
Andy Wiechmann : Thanks Baer and hi everyone! I want to drill into a few highlights of our all-weather financial model. We drove 14% organic subscription run rate growth during the quarter. To put that in perspective, this is an acceleration from 7% growth in the same period of 2017 and from 10% growth just a year ago. This acceleration of growth is a direct result of the increased investments we've been making in the key growth areas over the last few years with your support.  Our strong performance reinforces our long term target of driving low double digit subscription growth across MSCI. In Index we delivered 12% subscription run rate growth, aligned with our long term targets and our 33rd consecutive quarter of double digit subscription run rate growth.  Asset base fees, which are approximately one fourth of MSCI's run rate demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of volatile global markets. During the quarter, equity ETFs lined to MSCI Indexes grew net cash inflows of more than $27 billion, ending the quarter with AUM of $1.39 trillion on March 31. These inflows partially offset market declines of close to $90 billion since year end. More broadly, since 2007 and through the end of last year we've observed positive annual cash inflows into ETFs linked to MSCI Indexes for all years except one.  Finally, fees from listed futures and options linked to MSCI Indexes which are roughly 10% of asset based fees are based on traded volumes and are not linked to AUM and volumes in these products historically have tended to pick up in periods of market volatility, including this quarter where we saw traded volumes up 19% and run rate up 11%.  Our continued advancements in Index innovation which are centered on client demand, have enabled our ABF franchise to be both durable and diversified for the long term. Since 2012 run rate from asset based fees has grown at a CAGR of 15%. For the quarter, in analytics we drove 15% growth in new or current subscription sales, which offset cancels primarily from client events. We continue to see good opportunities in front office equity and fixed income portfolio management.  In ESG and Climate, we are driving a higher volume of larger ticket new sales, with a pipeline that includes an encouraging set of large strategic deals across regions. As Baer mentioned, the firm-wide sales pipeline remains healthy. We are watching the macro backdrop very closely and while it may cause some variance in sales or cancels here or there, we are encouraged by the overall forward momentum.  Across the firm the product and client experience enhancements we are investing in are enabling cross-sell and pricing opportunities, while supporting continued strong retention, as well as the ability to win new clients.  Let me now turn to our full year 2022 outlook. Our guidance across all categories is unchanged and assumes that global markets gradually improved from the current levels throughout the year. If AUM levels remain flat or deteriorate further, we will likely begin to implement elements of our downturn playbook and adjust our pace of investing on a very measured basis.  Our full year tax rate guidance of 15.5% to 18.5% remains unchanged. Our low tax rate this quarter was consistent with our expectations of having a seasonally lower tax rate from the vesting of equity awards. We would expect a higher average tax rate for each of the remaining quarters in 2022. For the full year we expect to drive continued high of 50% margins on a consolidated basis, which is in line with our long term target. As a reminder, the margin also reflects the integration of RCA, which is a lower margin business.  On the capitol front, our proactive actions provide another lever of value in volatile environment. Year-to-date through yesterday, April 25, we've repurchased $795 million of our stock or over 1.5 million shares. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $679 million, of which approximately $200 million is readily available.  We continue to have board authorization for potential financing and will continue to monitor the markets for attractive windows, although we have no urgency to access the market if they are not conducive. We have plenty of dry powder remaining to support strategic bolt-on MP&A deals. We can also support highly opportunistic repurchases, although at a more measured pace given current cash balances. In conclusion, that we are presented with an unpredictable operating environment, we remain laser focused on executing on our growth agenda and remaining highly nimble and proactive against this backdrop. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. I show our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning! I just wanted to focus on the chart you showed around the resilient AUM growth over the last decade or more. Just curious how you guys think about flexing your downturn playbook per se, to the extent the AU – the market depreciation continues to happen. Like at what level you guys start looking to approach that playbook to try and offset some of those declines? 
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, yeah, thanks Manav. I would say there's not a specific trigger for the upturn or the downturn playbook. As I've mentioned before, we are continually monitoring the environment and calibrating the pace of investment, and it's based not only on the current situation or how much that the market and AUMs have moved up or down historically to this point, but importantly it's based on the outlook.  I'd say in this case we're not adjusting our guidance because it's one, early in the year. Two, we don't want to pull back on the very important growth investments that are fueling long term value creation, but I think importantly in this environment, our business remained healthy. As Baer commented, the client buying behavior remains generally robust and the pipeline remains healthy.  Even when you look at AUM levels, this year they’ve been quite resilient. It's important to remember that even though specific global markets may have traded off meaningfully on the year, we have a very diversified global ABF franchise that benefits from inflows into ETFs, as well as global market levels. And then we have the added benefit of the growth in the futures and options franchise, which has provided a nice offset to some the market volatility.  And so, when you look at – just to put a finer point on that, when you look at AUM year-to-date, AUM is down only 4% from 12/31 through 3/31. So based on what we said back in January, where our guidance for the year was assuming that AUM levels are relatively flat for the year, we are now in a point where AUM levels are slightly below where we were in January, but there is a long way to go for the balance of the year and the environment feels, at least on the operating metrics front feels relatively healthy. And so as I said in my prepared remarks, if the markets deteriorate further or stay flat, we will likely begin to go to the downturn playbook and pull back on expenses, but I'd say it's too early to say that right now.  The last point that I would make is a lot of the adjustment and expenses is automatic. So the first things that start to adjust are things like our comp accruals and we do have other levers we can go to without impacting growth investments in the business. But it's something we're monitoring very closely and as I said, we're calibrating on a day-to-day basis. 
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it, that's super helpful. And then just as my second question, you know Henry or Baer, you know there’s obviously a lot more regularly announcements around climate disclosures and the efforts there. Some of it was expected, but just curious if this is a catalyst enough for your efforts to or seeing you know more revenue accelerate because of this. And also, I apologize if I missed it, what was the climate specific run rate this quarter? 
Baer Pettit : Well, that number is coming out, I’ll answer your first question. So look, we view this as really a fundamentally positive thing. You know we have leadership in this space. We believe that the manner that we operate is highly professional. So we have extremely high standards as we had in other areas where we've been regulated such as Index. So we believe that any environment that creates greater demands for transparency, for quality, that puts this topic central to investors’ agenda and central to corporations’ agenda is a very positive thing for us.  We're clearly also in – often we’re asked for our views on these topics by regulators in a variety of jurisdiction and are in contact with them, which hopefully we can help inform some of their thinking based on our expertise in these matters. So I think overall we definitely view these things as that direction, as being a positive or what we're trying to achieve. 
Andy Wiechmann : And Manav, just on the run rates, the climate run rate was $50 million at the end of the first quarter, which is up over 100% year-over-year. I would say just to provide additional detail on it, $18 million of that $50 million is from Indexes. 
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead. 
Alex Kramm:
-:
Andy Wiechmann : Alex, I wouldn't read into that too much. I would say that as you know the sales can vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter. The run rate growth remains quite robust at north of 12% organic subscription run rate growth and Index and so we're not too focused on either sales or cancels in one quarter and Index. I think we continue to be pleased by the progress and trajectory on the Index subscription franchise. 
Alex Kramm: Fair enough, I said it was nit-picky. Secondly, and this may be a follow-up to Manav’s question and I think Baer you answered it specifically on regulation, but zooming out a little bit more on ESG and Climate, your long term or medium term targets, your I think mid to high 20’s if I remember correctly for run rate growth here. You just said 50 and as I look at the last few years, that number has been accelerating despite the numbers getting larger and larger.  So I guess just to ask more specifically, if you look at the environment currently, do you think that acceleration can actually continue even despite those big numbers given all the pipeline that you have in front of you or should we be bracing forward, getting back to that mid-20s number in the not too distant future here. Thanks. 
Henry Fernandez : Alex, I think that our base case is that the number, the growth rate in ESG and Climate will stay elevated, relative to our targets for a very prolonged period of time. As we expand the ESG franchise to more client segments such as insurance on wealth and corporate and the like, and as we increase the number of used cases for ESG we are fining more and more demand.  If you just look anecdotally with investment banks and asset managers and asset owners, you know compared to a year or two ago almost every one of our clients already have a dedicated person for ESG, which is an incredible change over a short period of time. So I think we continue to be fairly optimistic. We are not going to change the target at this point, but we continue to be optimistic that high growth rate will continue.  Now, on top of that we are still in the very early days of Climate. $50 million run right on climate across all products of MSCI is a smaller number, a smallish number, but is growing at over 100% per year. I think the potential for our climate solutions over a long period of time could be that it exceeds the run rate of ESG itself, give the exercise and product to work for world and in various numerous, you know use cases and clients segment including the corporates and corporate advisors and the like that we are serving. So we are very positive and optimistic. If you thought that we were pretty bullish on this product line, two, three years ago, we are even more bullish today. 
Alex Kramm: Very good! Thanks for that color. 
Henry Fernandez: Yeah, let me add something else just to make sure none of this growth is going to come without a major investment, right, in the product line and data, in analytical tools and indexes and all of that, so. I hope that everyone understands that a meaningful part of our investment in the firm is to capitalize of this ESG and Climate opportunity and continue to be a leader in this space. So our investment plan, especially because of ESG and Climate is going to stay like this and accelerate as revenues accelerate over a very long period of time. 
Alex Kramm: Thank you.
Operator: I show our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about labor inflation, how that's impacting you. Do you expect that to impact margins this year or maybe you’re able to offset it by either some sort of efficiencies or just flow through from growth, but just talk about the cost environment right now. Thanks. 
Andy Wiechmann: Yeah, I’ll touch on the cost, but I first want to give you the holistic picture around inflation for us. I think you know this, but we are a high margin business, where small benefits on the top line can lead to net benefits on the bottom line, even if we have some inflationary pressure on the expense line. And so I do want to point out that we are very thoughtful and focused on pricing appropriately for the value we're delivering. We also factor in what competition is doing and client relationships, but we also do factor in the cost environment and the cost impacts to us and so we shouldn't lose sight of that. Now, on the expense side, I would point out to Henry's last comment. Expense growth has been much more driven by investing, so the expense growth that you're seeing is as a result of the meaningful investments we made last year that carry over from those and our continued investments this year. There's also obviously an impact from RCA coming on board, but behind both of those we do see some impact to wages from inflation and just to dimension out roughly, in a typical year we normally see low single digit to maybe mid-single digit wage increases. This year we're seeing something more like mid to slightly above mid-single digit increases in wages, and so we are seeing some impact there, but in terms of dollar impact it's not significant in the grand scheme of things. And I would point out on the non-comp side, where we have seen some pick up in professional fees, areas like insurance we have seen some increases. The bulk of our non-comp expense base where we have long term vendor agreements that have embedded price within them, we’re pretty well protected against inflation and so while it is a factor to us, the bigger impact on expensive is really the pace of investment and that's what we're primarily focused on. 
Toni Kaplan: That's great. Also, you mentioned a couple of times the pipeline being strong. Maybe you can zoom in on analytics for a second. Just because that usually tends to be the most impacted during sort of periods of uncertainty, partially because of the bigger ticket sales there. So just wanted to understand how you feel like the analytics environment is going and you know given the incredibly strong growth rates in the other segments like – you know I guess are you happy with 5% organic or do you sort of strive for better than that? Thanks. 
Henry Fernandez: Well Toni, you know we remain unhappy with the growth rate of the run rate in analytics. We've done quite a lot of different strategies to change that and a lot of it has worked, but from a small run rate basis – for example, we have been pivoting our analytics product line towards the front office, the portfolio management offices, so that's why you see meaningful, very meaningful double digit increases in the run rate of fixed income portfolio management that they alluded to, in equity analytics or equity portfolio management analytics; that’s another area that we’ve been pushing pretty hard, again from a slower, from a smaller run rate base.  I think the central issue remains, the central risk analytics platform which is sold to our cost centers in our client base as opposed to profit centers and that is a – you know very much of a mature product area for us. We're trying to reinvent that and reinvigorate that with climate risk as a driver of risk management in the central office and we have some early successes on that. Clearly the climate large enterprise is an example of our product line in that category.  So sales remain really robust when you look at the operating metrics. The challenge remains you know the lumpiness of the cancels at the time of renewals, because of the matured nature of the product line, the cost current that typically affects cost centers, especially central rate cost centers and all of that.  So hopefully over time we can outgrow the part, the mature part of the book of the run rate you know and the UFR, the prognosis equity analytics, fixed income analytics and the new use cases such as climate rate can continue to grow faster and therefore get the overall run rate you know to grow in the high single digits and eventually in the lower double digits.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks a lot. 
Operator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi! Thanks. Good morning! There's certainly an elevated degree of market and macro uncertainty in the external environment. Can you describe customer sentiment and how their budgets are shaping up, as well as that’s what you're seeing with the pace of client cross sell and up sell across the business. 
A - Baer Pettit: So George, so look, we want to be very numbers driven on this. Clearly we have been in a volatile environment that has got people a little antsy, you know generally. When I say people, I don't mean just our clients, I mean just market sentiment. But when we look at the facts of our pipeline, what's going on in the business day-to-day, we just don't see it yet. Now it may show up in the future, but for now everything is what we would expect it to be at this stage in the quarter, looking at the pipeline, etc. So we will give you new information as soon as we get it, but right now we're not seeing any noticeable change in the pipeline, the bar behavior or anything of that kind. 
George Tong: Got it, that’s helpful. You have a partial hedge in asset linked fees from futures and options volatility related revenues. Can you discuss how volatility is helping to offset AUM declines that we’re seeing year-to-date?
Andy Wiechmann: Yeah, no it's a great point. I would highlight that the volumes we saw in this quarter were the highest volumes that we've seen since the first quarter of 2020, with close to $30 million contracts traded. So given the scale of the futures and options franchise, it is creating a very nice hedge to some of those AUM levels.  We saw strong volumes and contracts based on our EM indexes, our EAFE indexes. Currently strong volumes in the Chinese A 50 products. We also had our record single day trading of close to 3 million contracts on March 14, and so I think you made an excellent point. Then hopefully as we continue to grow that franchise, it’s going to provide some additional stability with strong secular trends that will drive long term growth in the franchise that we have. The other point that I would highlight which doesn't show up in ABF, it shows up on the index subscription side, but is related, is the over the counter derivatives opportunity for us, and so given broader macro dynamics, there are opportunities for us to continue to drive strong growth in the over-the-counter index link derivatives opportunity set for us. So that's another area we're focused on and another driver of stability and growth on the subscription side. 
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you! 
Operator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide some color on the progress of integrating the RCA acquisition. If you could talk about the progress in enhancing the transaction data, as well as initial feedback from customer and any initial color on cross-sell opportunities there? Thanks. 
Baer Pettit: So, I think we're really pleased with the progress so far. Clearly the technology infrastructure work takes time, but we’re on schedule as far as what we hope to do. I think the most immediate progress we're seeing is on the client front as you mention with the integration of the client coverage teams and them working together as one unit, both you know across the world, in the Americas, in EMEA and you know building out what we do in Asia and you know we had a good quarter. So we had a good quarter as a combined team.  The client feedback is very positive and we are – you know as I mentioned, we are starting to build out some product innovations, notably bringing some of the climate capabilities onto the RCA database, etc. All of that will take a bit more time, but I think you know most importantly we have a significantly greater footprint now with real estate investors, and I think that that’s showing the numbers and hopefully we’ll build our reputation as being serious in this space. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's great. And then maybe just a quick question on, a large asset manager cut the management fees on their passive ETF. How should we think about how does that influence the index fees going forward? Any color would be helpful. Thanks. 
Baer Pettit: Yes, I'm not quite certain what you're alluding to, but the – my point would be that you know we've been pretty consistent on saying that the – you know over time the fees in this area has been compressing and those numbers have shown themselves over many quarters and years. I don't think we have noticed any sort of notable changes in the last quarter since we spoke to you, in our interactions. Clearly you know if the market environment continues to be more challenging, that could change, but I'm not aware of anything very material that we've seen since we last spoke to you. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Owen Lau: Good morning! And thank you for taking my question. So you previously expected the adjusted EBITDA margin for the All-Other segment will be closer to mid-teens in 2022, and I think you had around 26% in the first quarter. I'm just wondering the pace of the investment in this segment versus your original expectation in the first quarter and how should we think about the potential upside to your margin guidance for 2022 for this segment? Thank you. 
A - Andy Wiechmann: Yes, yes sure. So I would point out and make sure you keep in mind that there is some seasonality on the legacy real estate business, where some revenues are recognized based on deliveries of service, which tend to be heavier weighted in Q1 and Q2. So if you look in the past you will tend to see margins being slightly higher in those quarters, and so there's some continuing contribution from that, granted it's smaller in the absolute basis because of RCA being in there. To your point, there are a number of moving pieces on the integration, which will cause the expenses to be non-linear. At this point we're still working towards that mid-teens EBITDA margin for the year. Although there are a number of variable as it could cause it to be slightly higher, potentially slightly lower, not only related to integration, but also the pace of capitalizations. So there are certain expenses that we're finding we can capitalize a bit more. But I'd say it's too early in the year for us to change that mid-teens figure, although it could have some variability around it. 
Owen Lau: Got it. That's helpful. And then going back to the point you make about, I think the insurance from the $77 million run rate or 19% growth year-over-year in this segment, maybe could you please add a little bit more color on the growth driver there and the potential, kind of more product launches and the client sentiment there? Thank you. 
A - Andy Wiechmann: Yeah, you know I would generalize it across all of our products that insurance is a exciting client opportunity for us, and a segment where it's historically been less significant, and so it cuts across many of our product areas on the analytic side given the investments we've made and enhancements we've made to our fixed income analytics.  We have a much more compelling solution to insurance companies within ESG and Climate. You know we have some, as you know very differentiated insights and content that are extremely relevant to insurers who are trying to assess not only the impact of ESG and Climate within their investment portfolios, but also the general accounts at the organizations and for obvious reasons Climate is something that is very relevant to insurers and there's potential regulations around peak-half [ph] that could drive strong demand for some of our solutions there.  And then on the index side, especially around some of our investment thesis indexes, particularly those with ESG and Climate angles are very compelling across a number of insurance use cases, including index linked variable annuities. And so it's a segment that we're very focused on. We've got a clear opportunity and it's a matter of just executing against it. 
Owen Lau: Got it! Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Craig Huber: Yes, I want to ask on the analytics division, your long term goal of high single digit revenue growth, what sort of changes should we expect you guys to make there in the product or the service to help accelerate the growth. I know it’s not a huge part of your story, but just update us there if you would please? 
A - Henry Fernandez: Baer, you want to take that one?
Baer Pettit: So look, one thing that we’re working on now, we’ll have some announcements comings up in the next quarter is really moving away from our kind of legacy divisions of functionality and being able to deliver all of our capabilities through our ISaaS technology platform, and what this really means is being much more flexible in integrating into our clients environment, and being able to – you know basically clients to pick and choose the functionality and capabilities that they want and integrate that into their workflow. The next element which Henry referenced earlier is the focus on the front office. So while you know some of those numbers are lower to start with, we're very pleased with the growth for example that we have in the fixed income portfolio management, where it’s an area where we have increasing credibility and are growing as the numbers show close to 50% year-on-year.  And then the last one, the big driver is ESG and Climate and notably Climate integration with a lot of both, the risk capabilities and reporting capabilities, where because we have both the enormous data processing and risk capacities and leveraging our new intellectual property on top of that, all of those things you know should be driving the growth rate up and in order to do that we also have to then keep our retention rates of the existing book of business solid. So if we can combine those – if you like three growth drivers and also can maintain strong retention rates, you know those will be things that can get us on to that higher path. 
Craig Huber: And then also a similar question, the futures and options side. We've talked about this in the past. What's new going on there, the investments that you guys are doing there to help further make that division a lot larger with some accelerated growth there significantly over time. What was the innovation going on there please?
A - Henry Fernandez: Yes, so we’re very excited about the work that we're doing there in two fronts. The listed futures and options opportunity continues to expand as we have been showing in the last few quarters, and the use cases, the licensing of new use cases is also expanded, so most of this, the futures and options that we have are on market cap indices. So we are now looking to our – with our partners, the exchange [ph] partners, to do a whole generation of climate and ESG aligned indices for the productions and features, and I think that will put another layer of growth in this area in addition to the continued expansion of the market cap indices for listed futures and options. The second category which is what – you know what Andy alluded to, which is reported in the index subscription line or area is the structured products, over the counter options, you know flaps and all of that, that area is growing significantly for us, not only on the market cap indices, but especially on new investment thesis indices, ESG and Climate being in that category, but also thematic indices and therefore that is an area that we're putting up a lot of effort, and that normally translated into sometimes you know one-time fees, so these are recurring one-time fees that show up in Index and the Index description, they don't show up in the asset base fees at this point. So we are very excited about that, and that is a major area of expansion that we see in the next few years. 
Craig Huber: Great! Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Simpson from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. 
Greg Simpson: Hi! Good morning! So in Europe at least it seems you are seeing Climates is becoming really mainstream and the loss of mutual funds, [inaudible] and so on. So I’m wondering if you could share any color about what you see in terms of usage of your ESG and Climate products over time amongst the asset managers. Do your clients start with say, more standard rate in these products and then demand more prospective data and content over time, just trying to differentiate. I’m just trying to think about how revenue per client retention rates develop over time. Just any color would be great. 
Baer Pettit : Sure. So look, for sure your observations about Europe are correct and I would say that the landscape in Europe, generally whether it's a mutual fund business or in the institutional still looks somewhat different than in the U.S. or in Asia, and you know you can say that Europe is leading in this regard. It’s actually quite difficult to generalize across the variety of use cases that we have across different client types, etc.  Clearly as you rightly point out, the retention rate is extremely impressive at present. So we are, you know in addition to 50% of our business, our new business coming from new clients, I think what that retention rate signals is that, while this is you could say getting established in Europe, it is still very much in a growth phase. This is not by any stretch of the imagination a mature business. Clients are hungry for data, I think really depending on what they are trying to achieve.  So some of them want to build rules based Index products, some of them want to use the rating in active management process, some of them are less interested in the rating themselves, but the date underneath the rating that we collect on companies in the manner that we organize it and they can parse that data for their active management process.  So I think precisely, the element that is most exciting here is the variety of different types of investors and a number of different use cases that we are serving that make it hard to generalize about a particular path. So as long as we can continue to invest in the product line, to ensure that our coverage is extremely broad, that we're innovating around new areas of concern and focus for investors, and you know that in addition to our leadership in ESG, we continue to invest in our leadership in Climate.  I think those are all the things we're doing and it is creating both enormous demand and a lot of work for us hence. So for the foreseeable future we're going to be continuing to invest in this area and serving quite a broad range of use cases.
Greg Simpson: Very helpful. Thanks! And then just a follow-up whether you see in the current markets, the weaker market backdrop is creating more opportunities for both M&As. Maybe seller expectations are falling for high quality assets. Is there any kind of areas you are particularly keen to upscale or is that just [inaudible]? Thank you. 
Baer Pettit : I would say that you know we don’t necessarily wish for and welcome difficult market conditions and difficult operating environment. But having said that, this is what we do, our best at MSCI. These are the environments in which we tend to capitalize big time and create further leadership in a lot of what we do and out distance our competition, because we remain very focused on client complicity. We innovate a great deal in markets like this and we take full advantage of this locations and valuations such as certain types of bolt on acquisitions and the like.  You know you haven’t seen us make a lot of bolt on acquisitions, because the valuations are being elevated given the bullishness of market conditions. If you have a prolonged period of disruption here, it will definitely be a great environment to pick up data sets or technology or people or whatever at a lot lower valuation. That hasn’t happened yet, because there is usually a long lag associated with strategic valuations, but we could become more active, but it’s way too early to tell at this point.  But I think my underlying – my underlying position here is it say, you know watch for the performance of MSCI in difficult market conditions, because this is where we do our best. This is where franchises develop further as oppose to when you have very bullish conditions in and we decide right to sell both.
Greg Simpson: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. I show our last question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Pease go ahead. 
Keith Housum : Great! Thanks. Good morning guys. Just looking at the R&D expenditures for the quarter, It looks like those grew I guess the least of all the expense categories and you were down sequentially from the fourth quarter. So maybe I’m reading too much into this, but was there a pullback in the spending or were you guys starting to execute your downturn playbook already or perhaps just walk me through I guess the pullback from the R&D spending or lower growth and what your expense categories would have been? 
Andy Wiechmann : Yeah, nothing to read into there. I would highlight that expenses and individuals’ time allocation can move between R&D and cost of revenue, just based on the nature of the work, and so you will see quarters where cost of revenue looks high – growth look higher and R&D growth looks lower. Those tend to be the two areas where you do see our investment going and so you saw cost of revenues showing a higher growth rate in the quarter, and that's on the back of investments and/or product teams, technology and data, and our researchers, sometimes those individuals time will be allocated to projects that are more R&D in nature and sometimes they are more cost of revenue in nature. And so I would say it's not any indication that we are pulling back on the R&D type activities. It's more just a classification of where they show up.  And then I think the selling and marketing growth is a little bit more straightforward. There is some degree of investment spending there, but there's also just a degree of continuing to flex up on our go-to-market, where the expenses there are related to our selling effort, our investments into new feet on the ground and client services, as well as tools to enable our sales force. 
Keith Housum : Okay, that's helpful. And then you guys talked about kind of a natural hedge with the incentive compensation coming down if there was a downturn in the business. Can you just remind us there, probably a little color in terms of how much of the income statement would be allocated for incentive comp like in normal periods? 
Andy Wiechmann : Yeah, so I think that what we said is and I think we had a slide on this that we put out during the last quarter, where you can see the exact amounts, but just rough orders of magnitude. I think we said a 10% pull back would lead to about $15 million down flex or conversely up flex on the what is our bonus expense on an annualized basis. So kind of 10% moves on asset based fees can lead to a $15 million up or down flex.  Behind that, things like non-comp and pacing of selected hiring, some things that are a little bit less related to growth investments, we've got a number of levers that we can flex up and down to the tune of about $20 million. And so we've got some pretty meaningful degrees of freedom, all of it depends on – as I said in my first comments, all if it depends on our outlook and what's going on. We don't want to go to these things, but we are prepared to, to the extent the environment persists or deteriorates further. 
Keith Housum : Great Andy! I appreciate it. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I'll now like to turn the floor back to Henry Fernandez, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. 
Henry Fernandez : So, thank you all for joining us today, and your interest in MSCI. We look forward to continuing to speak and meet with all of you, including at various Investor events that are either sponsored by you our analyst or some of them you know in our own.  As you can see from what you hear in the commentary, we benefit from an All-Weather franchise at MSCI in good times and bad times. So clearly very important to underscore what the messages that we're giving you, as to where we stand in that part of the cycle you know, and what is benefiting our business, what is affecting our business, and at the moment as I said, Baer said a few times, we haven't seen any significant or meaningful change to our operating environment. Thank you all. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the call over to Ms.  Jisoo Suh of Investor Relations. You may begin. 
Jisoo Suh: Thank you, Elizabeth. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter 2021. This press release, along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief quarterly update, are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab.
 Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings.
 During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation.
 We will also discuss run rate which estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We, therefore, caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. Additionally, we will discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures.
 On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. 
 And with that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry? 
Henry Fernandez: Thanks, Jisoo. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
 MSCI delivered exceptional results in 2021, especially in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the strength of our ambitious strategy, key long-term investments and consistent execution. The results also reflect unprecedented demand for our solutions and enormous growth opportunities for the years ahead.
 To list just a few highlights, in the fourth quarter, MSCI achieved organic revenue growth of nearly 20% and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 28%. For the full year, we achieved organic subscription run rate growth of over 13%, record recurring subscription sales of more than $255 million and close to 95% retention. In addition, we generated free cash flow of more than $883 million, which represented a 16% growth rate. 
 Our strong financial results reaffirm our strategic progress. MSCI continues to expand its role as a change agent for the global investment industry while providing the common language and the tools investors use for indexation, risk management, factors, ESG, climate and other key investment categories.
 Across all of our business lines, MSCI is making a big impact and gaining further recognition. We saw numerous examples of this during the fourth quarter. In October, Hong Kong exchanges launched a futures contract on an MSCI China A share index, the first offshore sector balance China A share future supported and approved by Chinese regulators. It proved to be the most successful launch ever of a futures contract based on an MSCI Index.
 In November, we affirm our status as a leading provider of climate solutions for investors. During the COP26 Finance Day, the UN Capital Development Fund even launched a new ETF linked to the MSCI ACWI Climate Pathway Select Index. Before and after COP26, we rolled out several new climate tools, including an analytical tool that provides carbon emissions data for more than 15,000 private companies and nearly 4,000 active private equity and debt funds. This is in addition to the carbon emission data we provide on nearly 10,000 public companies.
 As the global race to net zero accelerates, we'll see enormous opportunities to provide data, tools and solutions to support investors' and companies' decarbonization initiatives and the resulting asset repricing and capital reallocation. Our ongoing and incremental investments will help us maximize these opportunities and drive climate progress across the whole of the capital markets industry.
 Climate is just one example of the historic changes reshaping the global economy. At this time, MSCI's products and services have never been more important to investors and business leaders around the world.
 Across most client segments and regions, we currently see a strong operating environment. Among our clients, we've seen more confidence than at any point since the 2008 financial crisis. Our intense client centricity has enabled us to add wallet share organically and emerged as a go-to partner for clients seeking to differentiate themselves. That includes asset managers and asset owners, MSCI's largest installed base of clients. Last year, our subscription run rate among those 2 client segments increased by 11%, excluding acquisitions.
 We're also rapidly expanding client segments and end markets such as wealth managers, case funds, broker-dealers, insurance companies and corporates. We generated close to $78 million of incremental subscription run rate from those groups in 2021 for a growth rate of nearly 20%. 
 Within our products and services, we continue to address the enormous market for indices across asset classes, exposures and investment thesis. In indices, MSCI remains a go-to provider for tools to support asset allocation, portfolio construction, performance benchmarking, indexation and customized [ outcome ]. As we modernize the client experience and capitalize on growth opportunities, MSCI continues investing in and executing on our data transformation strategy. This strategy was a direct result of the feedback we received from many of you more than a year ago and before the last Investor Day.
 To put this data transformation in context, MSCI has traditionally used third-party data to create indices, risk models and other products. We will continue to do that in the future while creating new pathways for clients to access and interact with our products, but we will also source and collect much more data from alternate and direct sources on areas ranging from private equity and fixed income to real estate and climate in order to generate more meaningful and richer insights for our clients.
 In effect, MSCI has always been a data processing factory. Now we are rapidly becoming a data-building machine. The value of this transformation cannot be under -- overstated. In a world that increasingly runs on data, MSCI's new capabilities will dramatically enhance our competitive advantages and boost our long-term growth potential.
 Our new data strategy is closely connected to our technology transformation. We recently launched MSCI Developer Community, a cohesive platform for clients to access our APIs and our code. This platform will help developers and quants customize and improve their offering and scale various use cases such as integrating front- and back-office applications. We're also pleased with our accelerated migration to the cloud. Last year, we successfully exited one of our on-premise data centers, and we are on track for another exit this year. 
 Looking at the larger picture, MSCI's all-weather franchise and mission-critical solutions position us favorably in every type of operating environment. That includes periods of sector, factor, geographic and ESG rotation due to our diversified product line; periods of elevated inflation due to our pricing power; and periods of market volatility due to our franchise in risk management and index derivatives around the world and, of course, our approach to repurchase of shares. Today, with a strong momentum in a constructive environment, MSCI continues making investments that we are confident will deliver tangible near-term benefit. These investments are fueling robust business growth and helping us modernize the client experience. We believe that they will also help us build on this historic achievements of 2021 and reach even greater heights in 2022. 
 With that, let me pass the floor over to Baer. Baer? 
C. Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. 
 As Henry alluded to, our Triple-Crown framework, emphasizing the highest returns, fastest payback and most highly valued business opportunities, is driving accelerated growth across the board as you can see from the record numbers. On today's call, I will provide more detail on some of our investment areas and growth opportunities. Most of our investments will be in areas where we have demonstrated leadership and see incredible demand. 
 Let me start with index where we are uniquely positioned to serve the global investment community. We are transforming the ability of our index clients to access, monetize and leverage our indexes and calculation capacity. MSCI currently calculates more than 260,000 indexes per day. With our investments, we expect that number could reach several million indexes calculated over the next few years. 
 Our forthcoming client application called Index Builder will provide investors with the opportunity to create, customize and test indexes around MSCI's world-class frameworks and content. This will put an index calculation solution at our clients' fingertips for the first time, accelerating our ability to meet their demand.
 Customized index subscription modules overall continued to show excellent momentum, growing by 18% to $93 million of subscription run rate. Additionally, customized indexes are a key driver of new growth opportunities within index-based products. 
 We're also investing to stay ahead of clients' needs for direct indexing as demand continues to grow in the wealth industry for personalized tax-aware portfolios at scale. Our strong brand across indexes, ESG and climate, factors and analytics, coupled with our portfolio construction and tax optimization tools, are helping us land several big wins, including with clients who are licensing our indexes and expanding their use of our ESG content and risk models. In fact, the AUM of direct indexing licensed to MSCI indexes is now roughly $60 billion, while our run rate for index -- direct indexing offerings across the firm is roughly $10 million.
 In the climate space, clients continue to adopt MSCI's Paris-aligned indexes, climate data insights, physical and transition risk models, implied temperature rise measures, our net-zero tracker and our TCFD-aligned and other reporting tools. Our climate-related run rate across the firm now totals $45 million, well more than double from last year. Following the successful product launch of Climate Lab in October, we signed several new clients during the quarter, including asset owners in EMEA. These wins also benefit the Analytics segment and leverage their reporting infrastructure. One of our largest current priorities is to build and enhance our core products, including Climate Lab and our climate models, data and research. As you can see from the numbers, ESG at MSCI continues to perform strongly and is a central focus for us in 2022. Our ESG franchise serves different types of investors including ESG integration investors, impact investors and values-based investors. Some focus only on the financial impact of ESG issues, while others concentrate more on ethical and sustainability concerns. We offer data and solutions to support each of these use cases. 
 New clients in the ESG and Climate segment comprised more than 50% of new recurring subscription sales during the quarter. We're proud of the role we have played in the investment ecosystem as the largest ESG ratings provider covering over 14,000  issuers. We will continue to expand and deepen our large securities coverage universe and high data quality. We believe our focus on rules-based and transparent methodologies, financial materiality of ESG risks and assessing resiliency to those risks has enabled MSCI to transform the investment process for our clients. Recent conversations about the need for standards and common definitions in ESG integration and sustainable investing present further opportunities for MSCI to help our clients.
 I'd now like to highlight some successes in Analytics this quarter. Our subscription sales grew 72% quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, they grew 36%, and our retention rate improved to 93.4%. This resulted in record-high net new recurring subscription sales of $18.2 million for the quarter. The wins were broad-based, including with asset owners and asset managers for use cases where we have leadership, such as enterprise risk and performance and equity models. We're also leveraging our traditional offerings for target client segments such as our enterprise risk platform for insurance firms and our fixed-income factor models for broker-dealers. Our business wins also consisted of new offerings to solve new use cases, including, as I mentioned previously, in climate reporting within Analytics platform and Climate Lab.
 Across Analytics, we continue to benefit from the enhancements we have made to portfolio construction and the reporting tools that we have developed, including factor and risk models, optimization engine and performance attribution tools while providing our index, ESG and climate franchises with critical and differentiated IP. We're also adding to our coverage footprint and leveraging our existing offerings to serve newer and potentially significant client use case. Our recent success scaling the hedge fund client segment is a great outcome of this approach, where our subscription run rate totals $143 million, growing over 18%.
 Before concluding, I'd like to say a quick word about our data capabilities. We continue to rapidly incorporate new proprietary third-party data sets to expand and enrich our existing content, improve interoperability with external sources and establish deep network effects and client stickiness. This is evident in fixed income indexes and modules where we have added data on roughly $53 trillion worth of additional fixed income assets.
 Meanwhile, through our climate investments, we are rapidly adding data on physical assets, target emissions and other key metrics. We're also investing in the data consumption experience for our clients. To that end, we recently launched MSCI Data Explorer, our new cloud-native data search and exploration application, which enables clients to access and download data sets across all product lines in index, ESG and climate, analytics and real estate.
 Looking ahead, we remain confident that our long-term investments will drive future growth opportunities. With that in mind, we will continue investing and continue meeting client demands for our offerings using MSCI's rigorous Triple-Crown framework as our north star.
 With that, let me turn the call over to Andy. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hi, everyone. 
 The record results for the quarter and for the year reflect the enormous opportunity set available to MSCI and our long-term actions to identify, invest in and capture those opportunities. Each of our product segments, index, analytics, ESG and climate and all other private assets, recorded their highest quarter ever for recurring subscription sales and net new recurring sales.
 We drove very strong double-digit sales and subscription run rate growth in each of the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions, reflecting our ability to unlock the significant addressable markets in front of us. Our One MSCI ESG and climate franchise delivered 58% run rate growth year-over-year, adding $129 million of additional run rate during 2021. And looking forward, our longer-term sales pipeline across products and regions looks quite healthy.
 Across the firm, our 13% organic subscription run rate growth was fueled by strength across nearly all dimensions, geographies, client segments and product segments. Index subscription run rate grew more than 12% year-over-year, our 32nd consecutive quarter or eighth consecutive year of achieving double-digit growth. Market-cap-weighted subscription modules, which represent approximately 75% of index subscription run rate, grew 9% while we recorded strong double-digit growth in our investment thesis index modules, particularly in areas like factors, ESG and climate, which collectively drove 28% year-over-year subscription run rate growth while customized index subscription modules grew 18%.
 Analytics recorded 5% organic revenue growth and 7% organic run rate growth with double-digit organic growth in both equity portfolio management tools and fixed income portfolio management tools, reflecting the strategic business wins Baer described earlier. Importantly, our strong profitability growth across Analytics is fueling company-wide operating leverage and enabling us to make investments in key growth areas across the firm.
 In ESG and climate, we drove outstanding organic growth of 53% in revenue and 47% in organic subscription run rate with strong demand from new and existing clients alike. To put this in context, since MSCI's acquisition of RiskMetrics in 2010, it took almost 10 years for the products in our ESG and climate segment to cross $100 million of run rate, which happened at the end of 2019. In the 2 years since, we've doubled that, and in 2021, with nearly $200 million in run rate.
 Within all other private assets, we are building momentum with organic revenue growth of 13% while benefiting from growing traction with our climate offering. Additionally, we're seeing strong early traction from RCA, which added $76 million of run rate as of 12/31.
 As we had indicated previously, we expect the annualized adjusted EBITDA margin for the All Other segment to be close to the mid-teens for full year 2022, impacted by some employee retention and integration expenses as well as the reallocation of certain internal costs to the segment.
 Turning to asset-based fees. Despite year-end volatility, we observed healthy cash inflows across geographic exposures and product areas and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. This included healthy inflows into products with emerging markets, developed markets ex U.S. and U.S. exposures. AUM and equity ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and climate indexes as of year-end was $227 billion, growing a tremendous 114% from a year ago, with cash inflows of nearly $34 billion during the quarter, resulting in more than 75% market share in global ESG and climate equity ETF flows. The period-end basis point fees were 2.54 bps. The quarter-over-quarter decline was almost entirely driven by mix shift, with higher growth in lower-fee products.
 Solid operating performance and notably strong revenue growth drove nearly all of the adjusted EPS outperformance in the quarter, with some puts and takes from higher tax rate and interest expense. Even in the context of business investments we've made, we drove modest margin expansion during the quarter, which continues to be a key objective. Excluding results from the RCA business, MSCI's adjusted EBITDA margin across the firm would be roughly 59.3% for the quarter, which would imply roughly 150 basis points of margin expansion. 
 We also continued our track record of delivering strong free cash flows of over $880 million for the full year or growth of over 16%. This was also higher than our prior expectations as we did not make accelerated incremental cash tax payments in the fourth quarter that we had previously assumed as a result of our latest views of the tax environment.
 Turning to capital allocation and our balance sheet. Including December and January month-to-date through Tuesday, we have repurchased approximately 925,000 shares or close to $480 million. Also, MSCI's Board of Directors has authorized the company to opportunistically explore financing options, although any potential financing is subject to market and other conditions and there can be no assurance as to the timing or certainty of the transaction. As a top priority, we remain focused on reinvesting in our business across the Triple-Crown areas that we've highlighted today, including custom, ESG, climate and other investment thesis indexes; fixed income and private asset content and solutions; data and technology capabilities; as well as client coverage, product and research enhancements. Additionally, we will continue to pursue opportunistic MP&A in highly strategic growth areas for us.
 Turning now to our full year 2022 guidance, which we published this morning. Our expense guidance range primarily reflects the investments we are making to fuel continued growth as well as enhance the client experience. Our projected level of spend assumes relatively flat market levels for the year. And as always, our expenses may flex up and down depending on market conditions. As a reminder, we expect normal seasonality in our expenses during the year with certain compensation and benefits expenses typically being higher in the first quarter. Our free cash flow range continues to reflect our confidence in strong collections and operating performance. Our tax rate guidance range assumes no significant changes in global tax regimes. Excluding the impact of combining with the lower-margin RCA business, we would expect margin expansion in 2022 across the balance of the company.
 In summary, as both Henry and Baer have noted, we are seeing unprecedented levels of demand for our offerings, and we are focused on capitalizing on those opportunities. We have an all-weather franchise that positions us well for all operating environments, and we're excited for the continued growth opportunities ahead of us in 2022 and beyond.
 With that, operator, please open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: Andy, you're guiding to about a 15% increase in EBITDA expenses year-over-year. Is your expectation that revenue will grow at least in line with the expense increase? Or is this sort of more of an investment year? And also just embedded in the guide, are you assuming that markets stay at this level? Or if they are choppy, I know you mentioned that you could sort of dial it back, but maybe that -- maybe for future growth, it's sort of the right decision to make the investments. So just wanted to hear about some more color on the expense guide. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Toni. So just on the comment about growth. Obviously, we don't provide top line guidance, so I'm not going to touch that. But I would highlight that -- and you see this in our long-term targets, over the long term, positive operating leverage, very marginal and positive operating leverage is something that's embedded in the business model. But our core focus today is really investing in the very attractive and large opportunities in front of us. We did that last year. And in the expense guidance that you see here, we're planning to continue to do that. 
 I would highlight that the largest driver of the growth in expenses really is those investment dollars. So it's investing in all the attractive opportunities that we've talked about and believe are very compelling, long-term secular opportunities. We do have some carryover impact from the 2021 hiring and investments, and now we're going to continue to invest in 2022.
 Behind that, it is worth highlighting and noting that there is an impact from RCA, getting the full year impact of RCA expenses, which feeds into that expense guidance. And then the smallest contributor is same-store wage increases, and we are projecting slightly higher wage increases than we typically do. But this is the smallest item, and we do have a number of levers at our disposal to manage through wage impacts both on the expense line item but also at the top line where we have a value-based pricing approach, which positions us very well for inflationary environments. 
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. Helpful. And then Baer, you spoke about investing in data. And could you just talk about how differentiated your ESG data is versus competitors and how hard you think it will be for others to replicate once you make these sort of investments? And I think this is a particularly interesting topic because I think the perception is that you have this leading brand. It sort of helps with client relationships and benchmarking. But I think the common perception around data is that data could become more commoditized or things like that. So just talk about how important it is to have this differentiated ESG data and how you get to that. 
C. Pettit: So thanks, Toni. So it's absolutely critical. So I think that at this stage, roughly 45% of our ESG data comes from alternative sources. So we're highly dependent both on, I would say, the expertise and depth and breadth of our research and our data environment, the combination of both of those. So I think we're very far from a stage where data in either ESG or climate is anything like a commodity. We're doing a lot of interesting and new research in this area. We're stepping up our investment dramatically, and that includes in both our infrastructure for managing all of that data. It includes the software, which enables us to go directly to issuers and makes it very easy for them to send us that data. And it also includes precisely those alternative data techniques such as natural language processing that allow us to go broader and deeper to look for topics such as controversies in the ESG area and new sources of information in climate. So this is really central to what we do in -- at MSCI generally and in ESG and climate, and we're very confident that it will be central to our competitive advantage for quite a number of years to come. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. 
Alex Kramm: Yes. Another question on ESG. It seems like recently, there's been an increase of autocalls in whatever, call it, popular press around ESG, about firms like you and maybe how some of these ESG scores are not really a reflection of what people think -- they're buying or getting into when they're investing in ESG products. So I don't think that's a new topic, and maybe this is just noise and maybe it's a sign of your success. But I'm just curious how you, a, view these kind of things out there? And then more importantly, are you seeing any impact from your clients? Are you getting more scrutiny from them? Are they asking more questions? Or is it not just having an impact at all? And are you seeing any potential like regulatory scrutiny increasing here, too? So I know it's a lot question but curious if you have any color. 
Henry Fernandez: Yes. Well, thanks, Alex, for that question. Now first of all, there's been no impact on our clients and client request. If anything, because of the controversy that has been created in the [indiscernible] press, as you call it. Clients have become more intrigued because one of the [ tenets of these reporters ] was that MSCI is the leading provider of all of this. So people want to come to us because of that.
 Secondly, and as Baer indicated in the prepared remarks, we at MSCI serve a large number of different type of investors. In ESG and in climate, we serve investors that are looking to integrate ESG and climate considerations into their investment process and, therefore, they only focus on financial risk associated with ESG controversies and ESG issues or climate issues in security selection or pricing of -- in their portfolios, right?
 The second type of investors are impact investors. And those are very different than the ones that are looking for financial metrics only. These are investors that are looking to, as the name says, make an impact in what they do, and some of them may be willing to give up returns. And the mandate that they've been receiving [ as a fiduciary ] indicates that they could do that.
 The third type of investors is values-based investors, religious organizations and the like in which they want to -- they only want to be investing in what they believe in and are willing to give up substantial returns sometimes for that or increase risk in their portfolios for that. So we serve every one of those types of investors. So I think a lot of what has been twisted and done in these kinds of controversies in the media is a particular tool. These ESG ratings are largely used by this -- by people who are looking for financial risk on that.
 So I think that everyone that we have talked to as a consequence of these articles has completely recognized the differences between one thing and another. And many of them have indicated that it is very incredible to have people that think that they can take  [ fiduciaries ] money  and go out and fight social causes with the  [ fiduciaries ] money, when that is not part of their mandate.
 So a lot of what these articles have been allocating is for people like you and others on this call to go out and invest and get lower returns on the basis of helping different parts of the world. And that is -- that's not what it is in your mandates and how people run money. So there are others that do that, and we serve all kinds of investors. We don't tell them what to do. We provide the tools for them to achieve their investment objectives, not ours. 
Alex Kramm: Moving on and maybe staying in the segment but maybe on climate, $45 million, I think, the run rate you gave, pretty impressive. Can you maybe help us break this down a little bit into what the biggest chunks of those run rates are? You just mentioned that around COP26, you've been introducing a lot of new products. So just wondering where most of that is coming from and then maybe in the next couple of years, as you invest into all these new products, where you actually think in the future most of the growth is going to be coming from. 
C. Pettit: Alex, Baer again. So look, the biggest driver is clients needing to report to either within certain organized frameworks, such as TCFD, or to their investors and to look at the climate exposures across their portfolios or, for example, within a given index or an index exposure. So we're really working around the clock as it were to meet a lot of those demands. 
 Now there are subcomponents of that. There are elements of physical risk in climate risk. So there are building blocks of those type of the climate exposures or climate reporting needs. But overwhelmingly today, if you want to put it in very plain English, people want to know what is going on in their portfolio and their security exposures as it relates to the climate transition and to keep them on either the portfolio itself or in the interest of their investors to record where they are in the path to net zero, where many of them have set goals and targets, right?
 So really, and if you think about that, it's an enormous effort for transparency and understanding in a category where the underlying data and assets is extremely broad. So that's where really our work is going on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. 
Manav Patnaik: I just wanted to follow up. Henry, you talked about how I think you moved from one -- you shut down one on-premise center, I suppose, and you were going to do another one this year. I was just hoping you could you give us a little bit more color on how many there are, I guess, maybe some more stats and perhaps how much is on the cloud or some other milestones to track this tech transformation here. 
C. Pettit: Yes, Manav. So look, I'm not going to go into like every data center on this call. But directionally, what I would say is first of all, which we're very excited about, we have moved all of our ESG, climate products into the cloud. They were the first. They're clearly amongst our newer areas relatively, but what that allows us to do is to work in an environment, where in keeping with the previous topics we've just been discussing here, we can enormously accelerate innovation, right? So we're very excited about that because it really means that it's a critical step forward in ensuring that we keep up with this enormous demand and that our investments are not merely in the data -- the underlying data, the research people but also in the infrastructure supporting all of that.
 So I think, generally, we're very happy with the cloud progression. We -- I think 2022 is going to be an even more important year for us and really critical. And on top of that, we're doing this on kind of a cash spending neutral basis across where we were before. So I think it's a great story for innovation. It's a great story for the future of the company, and we'll keep you guys updated as we make progress. 
Manav Patnaik: Got it. That makes sense. And then just the Board authorization to explore financing, Andy, should we read that as basically looking to raise some more debt to buy back more shares? Or is it more just refinancing ahead of rate rises, et cetera? Just curious how you guys are thinking about that. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. I'd say it's consistent with the approach we've taken in the past where as we delever, we look for opportunities to take the leverage back up. In this case, it would be new capital, so new money, additional cash coming in. And that would be used for general corporate purposes, including potentially repurchases, potentially some targeted MP&A. But it's really just taking advantage of an attractive financing market if we see it. And if we do, we're confident that we can get a good return on that capital, whether it goes towards continued repurchases at potentially attractive levels or MP&A or organic corporate purposes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. 
Ashish Sabadra: So just focusing on Analytics, you called out a pretty good subscription sales in that business. How should we think about the growth trajectory there and getting to your longer-term growth targets in Analytics? Any color would be helpful. 
C. Pettit: Yes. So look, we're pleased with the quarter we had. We -- I think we've got some strong plans in some of the growth areas that we've mentioned in analytics before, such as fixed income. We're really doing a lot of work also to ensure that the upside that we have in ESG and climate is translated into our Analytics business. And I think we're just generally really being in a very client-focused mode, and they paid off in Q4. So we hope to be able to continue to show positive numbers as we go into the next quarter. We always have a certain amount of lumpiness there. But I think with the continued improvements in both our content and our platforms, we will -- we intend to continue to show that we can move the run rate up and with that, the revenue with time. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick follow-up question on the future contracts on the MSCI China Asia Index. I just wanted to get a more broader perspective. How big is the derivative revenues based on currently MSCI indices? And how do you think about that over the mid to long term? How big is that opportunity and where we are in that process? 
Henry Fernandez: So the opportunity is very, very large in the context of the creation of a new market. There are 2 types of opportunities, one, in selected areas to create single-country, single-currency index futures and options and structural products that come out of that. Those are -- that's traditionally what we have been doing. But in the last 5, 7 years or so, we have opened up with our partners in derivative exchanges, the market for multicountry, multicurrency index futures options and those being used for structural products and over-the-counter products and the creation of investment vehicles.
 So that is in the context of the emerging market index futures and options, the EAFE index futures and options, the European one, the trade in Europe, et cetera, and the like. So we are very pleased with the -- so that opportunity is multiples, multiples of what we have right now. It's just going to -- just takes time to grow and educate the market and the work that the exchanges have to do to promote these products, et cetera. So we continue to do that.
 Now this particular product, China Asia futures was -- is an access product that, as you know, you can either go directly to the mainline to try to trade the local index futures or trade another futures that trades in Singapore or come to Hong Kong and look at this one. The benefit of these futures and the reason for this tremendous success is that even though it's narrow, [ 50 stocks ], it is sector balanced. It is constructed in a way that represents the broad market of China rather than the top 50 companies in the country, right? So there is a secular presentation from the major areas, the major industries in China. And it has been incredibly successful. And on the heels of that, our clients have launched EPS on that inside China and in Hong Kong, and we have converted certain other clients around in the U.S. and in Europe from other indices to this one. And all in, when you include the notional amount that -- in open interest in the futures contract and you include the assets that have been raised in EPS, we're already upwards of $10 billion in a short period of time. So that bodes well for a continuation of that -- of products to use. 
Andrew Wiechmann: And Ashish, I heard you reference the futures and options -- listed futures and options run rate as of 12/31 was $54 million. The over-the-counter derivatives opportunities that are very closely related but different show up in our nonrecurring index revenue, and there is also some portion in the recurring subscription revenue as well. So the geography there is just slightly different on the over-the-counter products. 
Ashish Sabadra: That's really helpful color, and congrats on the solid results. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. 
Kwun Sum Lau: So the retention rate was pretty strong at 94.4%, and fourth quarter is typically a weaker quarter for retention. Could you please talk about what drove that strength? Was it driven by a -- maybe a shift in client mix? Or was it driven by healthy capital markets? Any more color would be helpful. 
C. Pettit: Yes. So look, I think it's a mixture of things as in all these circumstances. We've clearly been continuing to invest in the quality of our products continuously. We've also been extremely focused from a client coverage point of view on client retention and put enormous amount of effort into making sure that we contact clients, that we monitor their use of our products, that we're regularly ensuring that they're getting value out of them. And so I think it's probably those 2 things. Maybe it's been a reasonably good environment, too, at the end of the year overall. But I think it's, for sure, I hope and believe both the quality of the products and the extreme client service focus on client retention. 
Kwun Sum Lau: Got it. And then on RCA, could you please give us some more update on RCA in terms of the pipeline and retention rate? And based on all the information we have in terms of like people may go back to office or working in hybrid and your conversation with clients, how do you expect the demand and retention of RCA in 2022? 
C. Pettit: Yes. So maybe just -- I don't know if we're giving out those exact numbers yet going forward,  but maybe on a slightly higher level, we're really pleased with the integration process with RCA. We did some internal surveys, and the RCA team is extremely enthusiastic about being part of MSCI. We're in the process of integrating both what you can prudently call the front and the back office. And we're putting together a very clear, combined real estate go-to-market strategy. So, so far, everything is going well. And I think what we've got here to all the real estate clients, whether they were MSCIs or RCAs, really shows our commitment to both the asset class and the -- very shortly, I think we'll see a lot of cross-fertilization of content and data, which will give us even better client offerings. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research. 
Craig Huber: Question on pricing. As you know, historically, your recurring subscriptions in indexes, 2/3 of the growth there, historically, will be from volume, 1/3 from pricing. I'm just curious, in this higher inflation environment, are you still thinking pricing would be about 1/3 of the growth for this year or maybe roughly 4%? Or is there a little bit more of upside there? 
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So clearly, in everything we do, have enormous pricing power. That is undisputed at MSCI, and our clients understand that, too. For us, though, it's -- we also have a responsibility to ensure that our interests continue to be aligned with clients in the context of how we deliver value and how do we do price increases relative to the way they run their cost structure and their business. So we've been very prudent in terms of that balancing act. 
 Clearly, as we have been making enormous investment in the data that goes into the products, the tools are being refined. The models are being refined. The client experience is getting better. The resources on client service are much larger as I indicated just a few minutes ago. All of that means that we're giving higher value to clients.
 And then secondly, as certain areas of our business have inflation -- higher inflation, particularly wage inflation, we're bound to be putting higher price increases this year than in prior years but in a way that is consistent to the approach we've always done in terms of never jump in the market, never abusing any kind of situation. We're trying to be constructive, at the same time being financially prudent and delivering -- and getting a return for the investment that we have made in a lot of our products. 
Craig Huber: And then my other question, please, on the index business for margins this year, assuming that the markets are roughly flattish, as I think you alluded to, that's your just basic expectation here. Do you think there's -- your margins there, you're expecting to hold them flat, maybe slightly up for the year. How should we think about margins in indexes, please, given all the investments you guys are doing there? 
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. So you highlighted correctly our baseline assumption here is that markets remain relatively flat for the year. I would say our top objective is really investing in the long term, very attractive opportunities we see in front of us in index. We're not trying to solve for a specific index margin per se. We really are, as a top priority, trying to drive leadership in these key large big markets. 
 Just regarding more generally, your upturn and downturn playbook, it's a constant calibration. So it's not only based on where AUM levels are at any point in time, but it's looked -- it's based on the outlook, and it's based on the success we're seeing in the areas we're investing in.
 We do have some self-adjusting expenses in comp and some discretionary areas that we can go to pretty easily. But generally, the last thing we want to do is impact those key investment areas. And so at any point in time, we may decide to pull back on expenses if the market goes down. But if the market goes up, we're likely going to start to invest even more in these very attractive opportunities. So it's tough to be more prescriptive than that, but I would say it's an ongoing calibration and something that we are continually focused on and having discussions around. 
Henry Fernandez: Let me also -- if you don't mind -- yes, let me -- Craig, let me also add that the -- when we say markets, remember that our asset-based business is completely diversified across geographies, whether it's Japan and Asia -- it's Japan, whether it's Europe, whether it's in the U.S., Canada, emerging markets, all that is diversified -- is highly diversified with respect to market cap indices, thematic indices, ESG indices, climate indices, et cetera. And it's diversified on our asset-based fees from  the, what we call the institutional passive and the listed ETF products. 
 So when you look at the totality, we're assuming that when you put all of that together in the blender, that is going to be flattish. That's our base assumption. There is -- that doesn't mean that there is not a huge sector rotation, but if sourcing goes up and the other thing goes down, that there will be money flowing to the U.S. maybe from emerging markets or whether more money goes to ESG and climate and it comes out of other parts. So it's very important to recognize that this is not one market like the U.S. And it is -- the totality of the ups and the downs when we look at all of that. 
 So we're very comfortable that this is a conservative assumption in a year in which started with a lot of volatility, but hopefully, the fundamental earnings and economic growth, like we saw today in the U.S., will continue to improve and eventually set a framework for a more constructive appreciation of equity assets. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. 
Keith Housum: Sales have been phenomenal this year, both recurring as well as nonrecurring. And I appreciate the investments you guys have made in new products and whatnot. But have you guys also made any changes in the sales force to help contribute to that and make this more sustainable in the long run? 
C. Pettit: Look, I think in a narrow sense, we haven't made any changes, but we have fantastic leadership in our client coverage organization. So I'd just like to call out Alvise Munari and his team who have done really an outstanding job across the globe. And it's just exciting to be around the organization because we have just really smart, positive, energetic leaders. I mentioned earlier that this is not only in sales but in client service and everything we do with our consultants to help our clients.
 So I just think we've -- and we have made, as ever, in any client coverage organization, we've made some tweaks to how we approach certain client segments. We're very focused on senior client relationships, which as we have been for a number of years. So all those things bring cumulative benefits over time. But just across the board, I think we've got a great team. We've got great leadership. We've got people who are really committed, and that's what we're getting from it. 
Keith Housum: Got you. Appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, you guys recently announced the strategic, I guess, alliance or relationship with Menai Financial Group. Can you provide a bit more color on the arrangement of that? Is that a partnership of any time -- of any type? Or how is that working? 
Henry Fernandez: So we have a large number of partnerships with experts in various fields, and so we are expanding our knowledge of areas such as biopharma or clean energy or disruptive technologies and the like. We have a partnership with a number of entities there. So with respect to Menai, that's one partnership, clearly, that we have announced with respect to blockchain and cryptocurrencies and the like. And we're not yet in a position to talk about the launch of any products. We are evaluating all aspects of that market and what value add can we bring, what opportunities for -- to serve our clients in the investment industry we can provide. So that's a continuation of our philosophy that we have had about building partnerships with subject matter experts in various fields. 
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Henry Fernandez for closing remarks. 
Henry Fernandez: Well, as you can see and hear from -- as you can see from the numbers and hear from us and from the commentary, we continue to have enormous opportunities in front of us at MSCI. If anything, I've said it in a number of forums that in the 26 years since I created the company out of various product lines, I have not seen this level of opportunities ever. And I've always been bullish, as all of you know, in the development of MSCI and the opportunities that we have had, but we're just seeing it all over the place. And MSCI is becoming a central location where people come to us for a lot of ideas in terms of turning them into products and services for the global investment industry. So we're very much of a nexus of innovation and ideas.
 So we will continue to capitalize on a lot of that incredible momentum with investments, in some cases, significant and heavy investment, in the Triple-Crown framework that we have created in order to have very high rates of return, fast paybacks and in areas of significant value. So our internal asset allocation is very demanding and very robust and, in some cases, they're brutal, right? We only go in those areas where we see very attractive opportunities. And we are very comfortable in the position that we're in right now and the expansion of the business.
 So we thank you very much for your attention and for your support, and we look forward to speaking to all of you in various investor conferences sponsored by many of you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Salli Schwartz: Thank you, operator. Good day and welcome to the MSCI third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter 2021. This press release, along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief quarterly update, are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today’s presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today’s call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You will find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run-rate, which estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run-rate. We therefore caution you not to place undue reliance on run-rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. Additionally, we will discuss organic run-rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call this morning are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. Finally, I would like to point out that, members of the media maybe on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli and thank you also for everything you have done for MSCI for the last 2 years. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our organic revenue growth of more than 20% and excellent performance more broadly this quarter is further evidence of the accelerating demand we are seeing across MSCI. It also validates the investments that we have already executed on, including those we identified at Investor Day earlier this year. In my 25 years leading MSCI, I cannot remember a time when we have seen so much demand for our products and solutions and has so many attractive opportunities. As the investment industry continues to transform, our clients are turning to MSCI to create standards and offer solutions across market cap and non-market cap indices in both equity and fixed income, risk management products and services, factor models, ESG ratings and data, climate data and analytics and insights and tools for managing private assets. Let me just give you a few examples where demand for our solutions is off the charts. In climate, we see interest exploding across our client base for data, tools, models and solutions within every asset class and across every aspect of the investment process. Ultimately, we want MSCI’s client climate offerings to be the common language that capital markets participants use to discuss climate. We want to help market participants navigate the largest scale reallocation of capital in history as industries and global economies begin to decarbonize. You will therefore see us to continue to invest heavily in our climate offerings. You would also see us leading key strategic initiatives in the world, which are focused on impacting the global transition to a net-zero economy. We recently hosted global asset owners, asset managers and policymakers at the MSCI Global Investing Conference, our flagship client event. This year, we focused the discussion in that conference on climate in the lead up to MSCI’s involvement at the UN COP26 Conference in Glasgow next week. In September, MSCI joined Mark Carney, the UN representative for climate, in playing a pivotal role in establishing the Net Zero Financial Services Providers Alliance. Collectively, the alliance members will give asset owners, asset managers, banks, insurance companies, companies and other financial institutions the information they need to pursue decarbonization strategies and help the world reach net zero by 2050. MSCI is well-positioned to be a key driver of the critical global dialogue regarding climate change. We already have long-term, deep strategic relationships with global asset owners, asset managers and other key market participants and we have a well-established and growing leadership within ESG. To that end, I’d like to talk about ESG separately from climate. We continue to invest in comprehensive securities coverage for MSCI’s ESG ratings. This includes the entire MSCI ACWI universe for equities, consisting of course of developed and emerging markets included in the MSCI equity indices as well as equity derivatives. It also spans across fixed income, especially corporate bonds, but also including munis, structured products and sovereign bonds. In addition to ESG ratings, we are also enhancing our ESG models and data architecture to provide clients with more granular data. In addition to carbon emissions and governance metrics, we hear strong interest in having more data on social factors perhaps not surprisingly given ongoing social justice issues and broader appreciation for the impact these considerations can have in creating or destroying shareholder value. In ESG, we are also investing in our sales and client service organization in order to serve a variety of needs across every part of the investment process, including from corporates and their advisers. Demand in ESG is truly on fire and you will see us continue to invest heavily in this area. Another area where we see relentless demand for our offerings is in custom indices. We highlighted this area during our February Investor Day and interest from our clients has been accelerating even since then. Investors are increasingly looking for custom-built indices, where they can choose their own universe, weightings, screening, hedging and other characteristics. This demand is likely to explode in the area of direct indexing. MSCI has already made a number of investments to this end and we will increase our base of investments to meet this accelerating demand for custom indices. Another area of renewed focus and high demand is our Factors franchise, which this quarter topped $300 million in run-rate, up more than 11% year-over-year. We continue to innovate in content, enhance our front office workflows and expand our distribution through partners and newer software applications. I will now provide a quick note on the wider operating environment for us. Our clients are engaged. They are feeling optimistic despite some of the concerns, we all hear about inflation, rising rates, potential economic slowdown as a result of COVID and even political and geopolitical issue. We see that optimism continuing and translating into higher demand for our products and services. We believe that we have never had a more attractive set of opportunities across MSCI as we see today. With that, I will turn over the call to Baer Pettit, my partner in this business for more than 21 years. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry and greetings everyone. In my comments today, I’d like to unpack the enormous opportunities that Henry described as well as some of the associated Triple-Crown investing actions that have continued to fuel our strong growth. Our pace of new product and technology development is faster than it has ever been as we race to meet client demand. First, related to our products and services on climate change, we now have a run-rate that totals more than $35 million in this category, well over double our footprint from last year. Our range of offerings and capabilities is expanding rapidly. We believe it is still very early days in what this franchise can ultimately be. At our recent MSCI Global Investing Conference, investors spoke with us about the need to holistically measure net zero progress in their portfolios and for individual corporate issuers. MSCI recently launched Climate Lab, a first-in-kind visualization dashboard that combines our climate data with MSCI’s analytical risk and portfolio management capabilities. We have made a series of investments to build comprehensive Scope 1 and Scope 2 datasets on thousands of issuers, which will now serve as the basis of better understanding the Scope 3 data of companies which comes from their supply chains. Additionally, MSCI’s analytics platforms are powering Climate Lab portfolio analysis capabilities, offering the first at-scale portfolio reporting in the market. This is critical for our clients to meet TCFD and SFTR requirements. Our newly launched implied temperature rise metric is another way that we are bringing transparency to net zero alignment goals. The implied temperature rise is derived from a given company’s existing activities and their specific future pledges from which we create a common measure of comparison for alignment to climate goals. This forward-looking estimate allows investors to set decarbonization targets and support engagement on climate risk at both the company and the portfolio level. ITR is available for nearly 10,000 issuers and is aligned with recommendations published by the TCFD portfolio alignment team. We also just launched carbon footprinting of private equity and debt funds, a new service from Burgiss and MSCI. This offering enables private equity LPs and GPs to measure and monitor the greenhouse gas emissions of their portfolio based on data estimates for over 15,000 companies in more than 4,000 active private equity and debt funds. Next, I’d like to speak about our ESG franchise, which remains a distinct enormous opportunity that enables our success in climate. As you can see from the numbers, our ESG business continues to grow at an extremely attractive rate driven by heavy client demand as we rapidly expand the universe of datasets we can offer as well as modernize the data consumption interfaces for our clients. With 63% year-on-year run-rate growth in our firm-wide ESG and climate franchise, which now totals $312 million, it is critical that we keep ahead of client demand with investments in this complex and ever-evolving category. Besides the need to cover an increasing universe of securities and issuers and the demand for sales and service across numerous client segments globally, we also have increasing demand for such categories as corporate governance factors and quantitative diversity metrics and various other qualitative indicators. I’d now like to address index, which continues to be a huge growth engine for MSCI. Besides the resilience of our market cap franchise, we continue to see strong growth across ESG and climate in Factors as well as in new categories such as thematics. We think of our non-market cap indexes collectively as investment thesis index. As the traditional barriers between active management and index investing breakdown, we are seeing large demand for innovation in investment thesis indexes of all kinds. One manifestation of this is in our custom index business, where investors of all types are in search of solutions they view as matching the market opportunities they see. MSCI has established the standard in defining the investment opportunity set based on our robust investment framework and rules based methodologies. But clients want to tailor this opportunity set to create and manage portfolios, combining their investment thesis with MSCI’s expertise in analyzing markets and in index construction. As of the end of the third quarter, subscription run-rate growth for our custom and special index solutions, have grown 18% year-over-year. This is an area we believe will continue to have strong demand and where you will thus see us continue to invest. We will soon be launching a beta version of MSCI Index Builder, a web-based application that allows users to design, test and subscribe to custom indexes directly from the site. Index Builder will deliver greater speed and control to our clients as well as further modernize their experience with MSCI indexes. I also wanted to make a few brief comments related to our fixed income franchise. We have made meaningful investments to bolster our data single security analytics and range of fixed income instrument coverage in order to enhance our portfolio management analytics offering. We are seeing very attractive growth, albeit from a small base, year-over-year. With regard to our fixed income index franchise, we have licensed a number of important clients for product creation during the third quarter. And in keeping with our strength in ESG, the AUM in fixed income ETFs were linked to MSCI Bloomberg Barclays indexes totaled nearly $27 billion, up 122% year-over-year. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I’d like to provide an update on our acquisition of Real Capital Analytics, or RCA, which we recently closed. As you may recall from our announcement of the transaction in August, we view RCA as meaningfully accelerating MSCI’s Private Asset strategy. Commercial real estate property values have already been an important component of MSCI’s real estate product offerings. Now with RCA’s rich transaction and pricing data, we see a wealth of use cases that we can integrate into cash flow models, liquidity models, asset allocation tools and many other solutions. Early client feedback has been quite positive as MSCI has also meaningfully extended key front office capabilities such as due diligence, deal sourcing and transaction data. The RCA acquisition has also significantly bolstered our real estate research capabilities. Looking ahead, I am confident the investments we are making today will well position us to capture even greater opportunities in the future. We are capitalizing on the volume and velocity of client demand for our offerings and we will continue to make investments in the context of our rigorous Triple-Crown framework. Let me now turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer and hi everyone. The results for the quarter reflect the enormous demand that Henry and Baer spoke about, which is translating into strength across most parts of our business. We had the best third quarter on record for both company-wide recurring net new sales and for total recurring subscription sales in both our index and ESG and climate segments. We also saw record quarter in firm-wide non-recurring sales, following strong performance in non-recurring sales in both Q1 and Q2. This strength has been driven by wins in index from sales associated with license and usage fees related to prior periods, derivatives licenses and our data packages. I would highlight that these sales tend to be somewhat lumpy by nature and we would expect non-recurring sales in Q4 to be lower. Across client segments, we saw a strong organic growth with sales from both established and newer client segments as well as resilient or improved retention rates. Asset managers and asset owners, which now together comprise nearly $1 billion of our subscription run-rate, collectively grew approximately 11% organically. And looking forward, our sales pipeline across products and regions and intensity of client engagement continue to be quite healthy. From a firm-wide perspective, the 12% organic subscription run-rate growth benefited from strength across segments. Index subscription run-rate growth was more than 11% year-over-year, our 31st consecutive quarter of achieving double-digit growth. This continued momentum is fueled by outsized growth in our investment thesis index modules, particularly in areas like ESG and climate, which witnessed 44% year-over-year run-rate growth as well as within higher growth client segments like wealth management and hedge funds, which experienced index subscription run-rate growth of 17% and 28%, respectively. Analytics recorded more than 6% revenue growth and approximately 5% run-rate growth, with particular strength in equity portfolio management tools and fixed income portfolio management tools. It’s also important to underscore that our analytics capabilities are helping to fuel growth in key areas across the company, such as our factor indexes and many of our climate risk and reporting offerings. The ESG and climate segment had another tremendous quarter, growing 53% in revenue and 46% run rate as we continue to see enormous demand across solutions, across asset classes and across client segments. Within all other Private Assets, we’re particularly excited about the larger opportunities in front of us with the addition of RCA, which added $74 million in run rate. Given these opportunities, we expect to be making investments in the near-term to integrate the business. When combined with the existing Real Estate business, these investments, together with some employee retention expenses that are not excluded from adjusted EBITDA as well as the reallocation of certain internal costs of this segment, will result in annualized adjusted EBITDA margin for the All Other segment likely closer to the mid-teens next year. Within asset-based fees, we continue to see healthy cash inflows into equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, which offset lower market levels over the quarter. We saw particularly strong flows into ETFs linked to our U.S. and developed markets ex U.S. indexes. And from a product standpoint, ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and climate equity indexes drew cash inflows of nearly $18 billion during the quarter, continuing to capture the majority of market share in global ESG and climate equity ETF flows. The period-end basis points were 2.57 basis points as we saw support from these strong flows into higher-fee products based on our investment thesis indexes. Solid operating performance and notably strong revenue growth drove nearly all of the adjusted EPS growth in the quarter. This top line growth was offset by a higher tax rate this quarter versus last year’s third quarter as well as higher interest expense year-over-year. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion after funding the RCA acquisition, executing a $700 million notes offering and redeeming $500 million in higher coupon notes. With this strong capital position, we remain focused on reinvesting in our business as a first priority. This will continue to be an area as you have been hearing about from Henry and Baer, including custom, ESG and climate and other investment thesis indexes in Private Assets. It will also be in data and technology infrastructure that underpins our ability to meet clients’ evolving needs as well as in the coverage organization that allows us to continue tapping into newer client segments and geographies, in addition to better serving our existing clients. We will also continue to selectively pursue opportunistic MP&A and share repurchases with an eye towards maximizing returns to shareholders. We have been actively pursuing both partnerships and potential acquisitions in key strategic growth areas at a faster pace than in the recent past. In addition to acquiring RCA, we recently partnered in the Burgiss acquisition of Caissa, which is strategic both for Burgiss and MSCI, and we have made and may continue to make very small bolt-on acquisitions and investments. Additionally, I would note that cash currently available for repurchases is about half the total cash balance given both global minimum operating cash balances and the timing and cost of accessing excess overseas cash balances. Turning now to our updated guidance, which we published earlier this morning, our increased adjusted EBITDA expense guidance range primarily reflects an estimated $19 million of incremental expenses associated with RCA for full year 2021, which includes $3.6 million incurred in Q3. This also includes a few million dollars of transaction-related expenses that we will not exclude from adjusted EBITDA expenses. The increased guidance for operating expenses includes the $19 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA expenses associated with RCA in addition to an estimated $7 million of transaction-related expenses and nearly $10 million of intangible amortization, both excluded from our adjusted metrics. Our narrowed tax rate range takes into account our latest view on a number of discrete items and the fact that we are currently expecting a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter than in the prior two quarters. Our lower free cash flow range is nearly all attributable to approximately $110 million in cash tax payments incremental to what we previously expected to make, the majority of which will occur in the fourth quarter. We currently expect these accelerated tax payments to reduce future tax payments. Importantly, our collections remain quite strong, as does the underlying performance of the business. In summary, as both Henry and Baer noted, we are seeing very strong levels of demand for our offerings across the company. We have a great operating environment to finish 2021 and are excited for the tremendous opportunities we see ahead of us in 2022 and beyond. Before we open it up for questions, I wanted to thank Salli for her enormous contribution to MSCI. This will be her last earnings call as part of MSCI, and her final day will be November 19. After which, [indiscernible] will be our point person for any investor-related inquiries and questions. We will miss Salli greatly as she’s been a key leader for us on so many initiatives over the last few years. We’re very sad to see her leave, but I look forward to watching her many successes in the future. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to dig further into the strong sales you saw on the ESG and climate side. Obviously, you gave a lot of color already, but can you maybe give us a little bit more detail what’s driving – what drove the sales during the quarter? Is it still a lot of the core products? Or are you actually seeing some sales already on climate models for corporates? So any more color in terms of where the – how the sales kind of broke down would be helpful in the ESG climate side? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure, yes, good morning. Alex. And clearly, this is an area where we’re spending a lot of time. I would say the success is across the board, so it’s tough to nail it down to one thing here. But we’re seeing success, as we’ve talked about in the past, across products where it’s in addition to the core ESG ratings and research, we’re seeing success on the climate side. We’re seeing that success across asset classes. So in addition to the success we’ve seen on the solutions for equity investing, we’re continuing to see strong traction across fixed income investing and then across client segments. So we continue to have very strong success selling into both established client segments like the asset owners and asset managers, where we’ve seen growth north of 30% in run rate. That’s been accelerated by the very strong growth we’ve seen in segments like well, broker-dealers, hedge funds. And then geographically, the success is really across the board. We are seeing strong success in the U.S., but we are, as we’ve talked about in the past, seeing outsized growth in areas like EMEA and Asia, in particular. So it’s really continued success, and I think it underscores the importance of continuing to invest to drive growth across all these frontiers. That’s really what’s going to continue to fuel both the growth and leadership on this front.
Alex Kramm: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, on the analytics side, Henry mentioned in general that the operating environment has been great across the board. But on analytics, it seems like I would have expected a little bit more on the sales side. And I know this can be lumpy, but just wondering if there is anything to highlight there. Because some of your peers in some comparable businesses are doing really well, and it does seem like on analytics you’re not doing as well, but I understand this is a smaller focus for you. Just curious if you have any additional comments here?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. And just based on the growth, you can tell we’re below our long-term target, and this is an area where we continue to focus to drive faster growth than what we’re seeing right now. But it is a little bit areas where we’re having strong success in areas where the growth isn’t where we want it to be. So on the portfolio management tools, both on the equity portfolio management tools and on fixed income portfolio management tools, where we’re largely serving that front office and tends to be quite complementary to a lot of what we do across the business, we are seeing very strong growth, very healthy growth. It’s on the multi-asset class front and in particular the enterprise-wide solutions, where the growth has been a little slower. And as we’ve talked about in the past, there tends to be some lumpiness there. Although we are having traction in some components of it, namely areas that are driven by some of our strong partnerships and continued traction in some of the broader solutions that we have, I would underscore and this is important to note and it doesn’t show up in the analytics numbers, that analytics continues to be a key strategic driver and growth driver for other business, namely in our Factor Indexes, as you know, but also going forward in areas like ESG and climate. The – some of the risk and reporting capabilities that we have in analytics are underscoring and underlying some of those solutions that we’re seeing strong growth in.
Alex Kramm: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. If your line is on mute, please, unmute your line. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you so much. Wanted to talk more about the intersection of climate and ESG with PE and the debt funds, you mentioned the carbon footprinting and the update. Just wanted to understand if you think that this is a really significant near-term opportunity and what else is being offered in the market. Is this sort of a unique solution or are there other competitive solutions in the market right now?
Baer Pettit: Hi, Toni, it’s Baer here. So for sure, we think that what we’ve brought to market here is – look, it’s always tough to say unique because we live in a competitive world, but we’re not aware of a lot of competitors in this space at this stage. So I think we’re pretty pleased that we’ve come out with this initial product working with Burgiss. We also have plans to expand a lot of our current rating infrastructure for ESG into private markets and are looking forward to making progress in that area in the year ahead. So I think we have a lot of components here that I would say are differentiated and we hope will continue to be differentiated in the market ahead. Equally, we’re never complacent. And when you look at both the areas of private markets analytics generally and climate and ESG, those are clearly areas where competition is growing dramatically. And so it’s our intention to both invest in order to stay ahead, and we’re confident we could do so. But we will have to see how that market develops because it’s very early days, and we’re just committed to investing to make sure we maintain leadership.
Toni Kaplan: That’s great. And I did want to ask about investments versus margins. You talked about EBITDA margins for All Other next year being closer to mid-teens. But on the other hand, I feel like you’re at a point where you’re seeing the most significant opportunity that you’ve seen, I think, are sort of the way I’m paraphrasing what you’ve said on the call. So tell me about how you think about the right level of investment when there is such strong opportunity ahead. Should you be investing more? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. Toni, it’s an important question for us. And as we’ve talked about in the past, we’re in a mode of continuing to invest in the business to drive growth. And we’ve gone to our upturn playbook this year, as you know, given the strong performance, and importantly, also the strong operating environment that you see. And so that’s something that we will continue to do as we see the opportunities and the enormous demand that Henry and Baer talked about in their prepared remarks today. And so when you look at the areas where we are investing and we will continue to invest, it’s the areas that are the key growth drivers for us in key strategic areas. So by product segment, you can see outsized growth in the ESG and climate; EBITDA expenses, you see it in index EBITDA expenses. As you know, these are key growth drivers of both revenue and profits for the firm. When you look at where we’re investing across functional lines that’s heavily into data and technology research and the product teams, particularly product teams supporting ESG and index; and then across investment areas, it’s the index platform – the new index platform that we’re developing; it’s the ESG platform that Baer alluded to, our investment thesis indexes, ESG technology and data; and more broadly, we are continuing to lay the foundation for continued growth and supporting opportunities into the future. On the All Other line, there is a lot of noise in there. So given the integration that’s taking place, given some of the transaction-related expenses, the margin is a little – the margin comment that I made is a little bit not necessarily a good reflection of what to expect going forward. That’s just a reflection of all the moving pieces we expect next year. And clearly, Private Assets, particularly from an inorganic standpoint is a focus area for us and a big investment area. But for us, as a firm, it continues to be – and this is where you see the EBITDA expense growth that’s across ESG and climate and indexes primarily.
Henry Fernandez: Let me add to that, if you don’t mind. As you may remember, in the lead-up to our Investor Day, we obviously had analyzed extensively the tremendous opportunities that we see and the demand that we see for our products and services, which has actually accelerated quite significantly since then. But we wanted to be – to have a sanity check. We wanted to make sure that the owners of this company and the shareholders gave us their perspective on what they thought we should be doing given what we saw in the marketplace. And the answer was a resounding vote of confidence in the opportunities. They sold them the same way. They added a few more, like they encourage us extensively on ESG data, which we have worked hard on since then. And that it would be a remiss, it would be almost irresponsible not to invest heavily in those big growth areas that we see coming. So that was a very strong indication and by – a strong vote of confidence and speaking part of the vast majority of our shareholders. So clearly, we need to balance all of those wishes, ours and our shareholders, with continued financial discipline of earnings growth and profitability year-in and year-out and the ones we begin to lose that, that’s always a problem. And therefore, that’s when we came up with the concept of very modest, at best, margin expansion over the next few years.
Toni Kaplan: 100%. Thanks and good luck, Salli.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Can you hear me now?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes.
Manav Patnaik: Perfect. Andy, just first, just to – on some of the moving pieces for next year, it sounds like on the cash flow, it’s a one-time impact this year. I think you mentioned it’s a benefit going forward, if you could just help us with that. And I just wanted to clarify that mid-teens EBITDA number you gave for All Other, was that for 2022 as well?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. So Manav, on the tax and free – and primarily as it relates to free cash flow because that’s where it shows up most notably, we – I think like a lot of companies right now and like many in the industry, we’re monitoring the very dynamic environment for tax regime and tax policies. And as you know, there are potential changes on the horizon globally. And so as we continue to do that, we are trying to optimize our tax footprint and ensure it’s aligned with the operations of the company, and importantly, against that dynamic tax environment. And in this case, some of the actions that we’ve taken are accelerating income and tax payments into Q3 and Q4 of this year that are higher than we anticipated originally. And so we’ve got the $110 million or so of elevated tax payments coming in this year. And expectation is that will lead to lower tax payments in future years. And so the place that shows up this year is really in the free cash flow line. And that’s the only reason why our free cash flow guidance has come down. Actually, collections remain very strong across the business. DSO is strong. And as you know, revenue and business growth continue to be very strong. And so really, the only change on the free cash flow side is to reflect those accelerated tax payments that we made a little bit in Q3 and mostly expecting in Q4 here. On the margin comment for RCA, that is related to 2022. So we wanted to provide a little bit more color to you given all the moving pieces related to the integration some of the transaction-related expenses, which will trickle into next year, and then the combination of the two businesses, our core Real Estate business combining with RCA. And so on an annualized basis next year, we’re anticipating a margin in the mid-teens-type range. That’s not the case for the fourth quarter of this year, just to be clear.
Manav Patnaik: Understood. And then just one follow-up, I think you had mentioned the inorganic focus in the Private Asset class area, and you’ve obviously done a few deals. But I was just hoping to get just quickly wear off what that pipeline or landscape looks like in terms of the opportunities there?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. So – yes, let me give you some color – a little bit more color on the activity beyond what we’ve announced and what we mentioned, and I can try to provide a bit more color on the areas that we’re focused on. So in addition to the RCA transaction and supporting Burgiss on their acquisition of Caissa, which we were heavily involved in, throughout the year, we have made a couple of small investments in highly strategic partners. We’ve also made one very small acquisition in the private asset data space that closed very recently. And so in the case of the investments, these are companies where we do have partnerships and who have important either commercial relationships for us or have unique datasets that we’re using and combining to unlock and create value. And so those are the types of things that we are going to continue to do. We are going to be very active and as we have talked about in the past, the MP&A space. But we will continue to be very disciplined and focused on areas that are strategically critical for us and areas where we are confident that we can create growth and ultimately value. And so not surprisingly, the areas where we are heavily focused are areas like ESG and climate, areas like private assets. These are areas where having unique datasets and access to unique datasets, are key competitive advantages and speed-to-market are very important for us. And so we will continue to focus on MP&A around those areas.
Manav Patnaik: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.
Craig Huber: Yes. Thank you. My first question on analytics, obviously, you grew about 6% this last quarter, an acceleration from recent years. Obviously, long-term goal is high-single digits. What do you have left to do on your analytics business here to help accelerate the growth there? What products or services there do you have to enhance in order to get that growth rate a little bit faster?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So, I think the first thing to always remember that the analytics product line is really a grouping of a number of other sub-segments, which we define them into four categories and each one of those into even further categories. The four categories are equity analytics or equity portfolio management analytics; fixed income portfolio management analytics; multi-asset class front-end portfolio management and then what we call internally enterprise risk performance, which is the central sort of enterprise risk of many asset owners and other managers. So, in those four categories, clearly the majority of the run rate is in the last one, which is the enterprise risk and performance. And what we are trying to do is in addition to continuing to serve the needs – the multi-asset class risk management needs of our clients in a central risk function, we are trying to pivot our strategy towards the portfolio management side in equities, in fixed income and in multi-asset class. And so far, this strategy is working. The fixed income part, although from a small base, grew 80% in the last quarter. And the equity – our portfolio management analytics part grew double digits as well. And so did the multi-asset class, but from largely the sales that were done prior to the quarter. So, that’s – so the pivoting is in addition to selling multi-asset class risk solutions to cost centers, which are basically the risk management offices – the central risk management offices. We want to sell portfolio management solutions to the profit centers that are in the front-end of our clients. And the latter is especially good for us because that’s where a lot of our ESG and climate and a lot of our index activities revolve around. So, that’s the process that we are trying to do in this concept.
Craig Huber: Great. Thank you and Salli, all the best to you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Owen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Could you please talk about the traction of the China A50 Connect Index futures? How should investors think about the opportunity there? And then if there is any other potential partnership opportunities with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to launch more new products, any more color would be helpful. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Well, we – as many of you know, we – the Hong Kong exchange has launched the MSCI A50 Connect futures back last Monday – the Monday of last week, so it’s been seven-or-so trading days or so. And so far, it has been the most successful futures contract launched in MSCI history and I think in Hong Kong exchange’s history. The trading volume over that seven-day period has been $1.5 billion trading volume, and the open interest is approaching $400 million. So, it bodes well for the futures success of that contract. In addition to that, around the same time, four asset managers in Mainland China launched ETFs on the A50 – MSCI A50 index. And as of last night, the total assets that they both offer of them have gathered in their launches has been in excess of $4 billion. So, those are also very, very successful ETF launches that we – that our clients have done. And therefore, what we are trying to do is build an ecosystem inside – in Hong Kong and inside Mainland China between futures and the ETFs and the structured products. So, we are now working hard in getting clients to license the index for ETFs in Hong Kong and also developing the structural product market around this product of the A50. So, so far, so good. Now, we do have a few other ideas that we are working on, and we constantly do so to see what else can we be launching not only in Asia but in Europe or in the U.S. with our partners. You obviously saw the announcement that we made with the Cboe in Chicago about the expansion of the relationship on MSCI index options, and another family of industry is being launched there. So, we are putting a lot of faith that, that will also continue the development of this area for us.
Owen Lau: Got it. That’s very helpful. And then one modeling question for RCA. How should we think about the purchase price adjustment and deferred revenue? How should we model it that over the next few quarters? Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. Sure. So as of right now, we really don’t expect it to have a material impact, and that’s based on the anticipated standard setting activities that we are following. We are finalizing the exact impact there and we will update you as appropriate. But as of right now, you should assume no material impact on that front. Maybe it’s helpful if I just take a step back and underscore some of the moving pieces on RCA more broadly. But I know I mentioned a number of these in the prepared remarks, but I will provide a little bit more color here just so we are on the same page. On the revenue side, we added $74 million of run rate as of September 30th. There was about $3.4 million of revenue from RCA in the third quarter. On the expense side, I will break it down into three pieces, and I think this is a good way to think about it. On the adjusted EBITDA expense front, we are adding about $19 million of expenses this year. About $3.6 million of that was incurred in the third quarter. And I would also highlight that within that $19 million, there is a few million of transaction-related expenses, mainly in areas like retention. The second category on the expense side is on D&A, where we are adding about $10 million of intangible amortization to this year, and a small amount of that was in the third quarter. And the large majority of that is the intangible amortization associated with the purchase accounting. And then the last category is in OpEx. And there is about another $7 million of transaction-related expenses that we have excluded from adjusted EBITDA. And these are in areas like deal fees, professional fees, severance. And about $5.5 million of that $7 million was in the third quarter. And so when you look at the shifts in guidance for the year, you can see we took expense – adjusted EBITDA expense guidance up by about $20 million, which mirrors the $19 million of EBITDA expenses I just mentioned. And then if you layer on top of that $19 million, the $10 million of D&A and then the $7 million of excluded transaction expenses, it gets you to the vicinity of $35 million, which is what the increase to OpEx guidance was. And so the shifts in expense guidance were wholly related to RCA. And as I underscore, there is going to continue to be a number of moving pieces, some ongoing integration expenses. And so when you put the combined businesses together, we are looking at a margin on an annualized basis closer to the mid-teens for next year.
Owen Lau: Thank you, Andy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my questions. So, just wanted to focus more on the Investment Solutions as a Service, I was wondering if you could provide the progress on that front, particularly on the data management solutions as well as the investment analytics and the shift away from beyond towards more of a modular analytics solution on both those fronts. Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Sure. Hi Ashish. So look, we are going through our operating plan now for the coming year. And for sure, the delivery – the pivot in our delivery is very much towards those platforms. So, we mentioned Climate Lab earlier, and that is being built out on that infrastructure as well as some of our existing analytics portfolio aggregation capabilities and all the new index capabilities that are also being built out in that way. So – and as we have previously mentioned, the data distribution solutions that we are putting on the web are also in this common infrastructure. So, the way that I would say it is pretty much all new solutions will be built on this common infrastructure. And that doesn’t mean that we will be there entirely overnight. But I think that it both means an improvement in user experience in the coming years and also efficiencies because we are not duplicating the separate application developments that we did historically. So, I think we are on a good path. We will continue to bring out things as we did this quarter and the quarters ahead, and we will keep you apprised of what I think will continue to be positive developments in that area.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful color. Thanks for that. And maybe just a quick question on the RCA. It’s been just over a month since you closed that acquisition. I was wondering, any initial feedback that you have received from customers? And also, as you have had a chance to look at that business much more closely, how do you think about the cross-sell opportunity, even opportunity to sell some of the MSCI offerings into the RCA customer base? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Yes. Look, so we are very positive on all those fronts. So, first of all, the client response has been extremely positive both from MSCI and RCA clients and shows our commitment to investing in real estate. From – I would say from an operational point of view, we – there have been no surprises in a positive sense. So, we have – I think we are going to be on a pretty strong path of integration. There is a lot of common understanding related to the data and across both the MSCI Real Estate and RCA. So, that is making progress. And then for sure, we have a lot of interesting opportunities to create new products. I mean clearly, it’s early days. But our new Head of Real Estate Research was a former IPD person who then went to RCA and now has come back to MSCI via this route. So, we are really excited by the common capabilities that we can build. And I am sure we will be showing new things of that in the coming year.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful color. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: Good morning guys. I was hoping to unpack the custom indexes just a little bit more on the opportunity there. Can you guys talk about perhaps the pricing opportunity in terms of custom indexes and how it aligns with or compares to the rest of the portfolio? And then do these tend to have like a stickier ability to be maintained within the client and I guess better client retention?
Baer Pettit: Yes. So look, I think this is an area which is developed for many years. So, it’s not a new area for us, but the demand and the complexity of the demand has increased, and that is a huge opportunity for us. So, whereas historically, we had relatively straightforward customization requests, which might be to exclude a sector or a country or what have you, now we have an enormous variety of requests, including optimizations, different asset classes combined, going beyond even securities. We are clearly looking at some crypto categories, as we have mentioned before. So, there is an enormous amount of demand. There is increasing complexity, which is a good thing, but we need to invest to ensure that we can deliver for that. And look, I would say that the retention is not really the issue in the sense that we have great retention in cross index in any case. And I don’t think the retention in custom indexes is dramatically different. The real upside is in the top line growth. And so that’s what we are investing for. And it goes across all client types. It’s – whether it be on the sell side, whether it be for asset owners or asset managers, the demand is coming from all those client types. And so we are very excited about the opportunities, and we have to make sure that we have the infrastructure to deliver on.
Keith Housum: Great. I appreciate it. And then Andy, just following up a little bit on the comment you made regarding sales, obviously, a great quarter in terms of sales for you guys. And I know you referenced that there is some lumpiness there, as there always is. Is there a sense that any business was pulled forward from the fourth quarter at all and has helped your third quarter numbers?
Andy Wiechmann: No. No, this was purely – the comments purely related to the lumpiness of one-time sales in nature, where we have had a few quarters now of pretty strong one-time sales. And this most recent quarter, the third quarter, was our highest ever. And so there is just a little bit of – based on the pipeline we see right now, tends – we are expecting a little bit of a drop off in Q4 here, likely to be more in line with the average levels we have seen over the last couple of years.
Keith Housum: Great. Thanks Andy.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hi, hello. Just a very quick follow-up on RCA on the modeling side, Andy, can you just – and maybe this was talked about already. But in terms of how revenues flows into the income statement, is there anything that I should be thinking about between run-rate, which I think ended at $74 million. And going forward, are there any – is there any seasonality, any one-time sales, or is run rate a pretty good predictor of the following quarter? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Yes. For the RCA business, run rate is probably a pretty good indicator of the revenue coming from RCA. As you know, in our core real estate business, there tends to be the seasonality where we do have a good chunk of the business that’s tied to deliveries. And so we do get some seasonality in that side of the business. But for RCA, it’s much more traditional subscription model. And so run rate is probably a decent indicator of the revenue that we are expecting from it.
Alex Kramm: Fantastic. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Henry Fernandez, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you for joining us today. As you can see and hear from the numbers and the commentary, we continue to have enormous opportunities in front of us at MSCI. And we will continue our triple-crown investment philosophy to meet that demand from our clients and maintain our leadership. So, thank you for your attention and your support, and we will be able to take questions during the quarter. And obviously, see you next call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Sallilyn Schwartz: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter 2021. This press release, along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call, as well as the brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab.  Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings.  During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to: organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation.  We will also discuss run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detailed in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We, therefore, caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenue.  Additionally, we will discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures.  On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer.  Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.  With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. MSCI delivered exceptional results in the second quarter. This outcome was the direct result of our vision to be a change agent for the investment industry, our mission to help investors build better portfolios for a better world, and the Triple-Crown investments we are making to support these efforts. For the quarter, we achieved total revenue growth of 22%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 25% and adjusted EPS growth of 38%.  Last month, we held our annual strategy session with our Board of Directors. Our Board and our management team are incredibly excited about the many opportunities we have to significantly accelerate our growth, including in solutions like investment thesis indices, fixed income, private assets, and of course, ESG. And now, even more so, climate. We are making great progress with the newer client segments that we have previously highlighted to you, including wealth managers, insurance companies and corporates. And with respect to capabilities, we continue to transform and expand our technology and data infrastructure to align with our clients' needs.  Let me now highlight one area within each of solutions, client segments and capabilities.  Within solutions, MSCI intends to lead all participants in the investment ecosystem in addressing climate change and carbon intensity in their investment portfolios and in their business operations. We believe that addressing the impact of climate change will require the largest reconstruction of the global economy since the Industrial Revolution some 200 years ago.  Institutional investors will need to reallocate their enormous pools of capital to the decarbonizing companies that are on track to keep the world under a 1.5-degree Celsius rise and away from those companies that are moving too slowly or not acting at all. Investors and stakeholders are already exerting influence on companies and management teams to transform their business models to reduce their carbon emissions. Assets will be massively repriced, and we believe the net-zero revolution will produce spectacular winners and some losers. Moreover, this revolution will touch every company in the world. And for that matter, every part of our societies around the world. We believe this transformation will occur much sooner than companies and investors may see coming, and a number of market participants need to act faster and more decisively than they may appreciate. As you can imagine, this presents MSCI with enormous opportunities. We want to be the premier provider of all tools involved in portfolio decisions related to climate.  In the near term, we look ahead to the COP26 conference to be held in Glasgow later this year. And we expect policymakers, regulators, market participants, and various other constituents to push for more extensive climate-related disclosures. MSCI will play its part and will join with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in organizing a net-zero financial service providers alliance. This new alliance will galvanize the world's index and data providers, credit rating agencies, and accounting firms to lay the tracks that can take investors and companies to a net-zero world.  We are fast in reaching our suite of climate products and aggressively investing to provide the market with the climate models and reporting capabilities that can contribute to or even drive developing broader standards. We're also pursuing a multi-asset class coverage strategy within climate, which is beyond public securities. This strategy will include real estate, private equity and private debt.  Within client segments, our spotlight are ongoing success with corporates, where we are providing public and private issuers of capital and their corporate advisors with solutions for TCFD reporting and ESG and climate benchmarking. Our greenfield success in this client segment and in others, such as wealth managers and insurance companies, directly reflects the investments that we have made not only in our product offerings, but also in our client coverage organization.  Our value proposition also remains very strong with asset managers and asset owners, which still represents the largest part of our client base. We are honored to have been selected by the California State Teachers Retirement System to provide their policy benchmark. CalSTRS adopted a custom MSCI All Country World Investable Market Index, displacing its prior domestic benchmark. The primary reason was to simplify their benchmarking process by moving away from a weighted calculation of separate U.S. and non-U.S. exposures. Using 1 index also simplifies performance attribution and better reflects CalSTRS' goal to target and manage active risk.  Within capabilities, I would like to focus on how data is playing a critical role in our vision of revolutionizing the investment industry. Data is the core building block of investment analysis, reporting, another processes and a competitive advantage for MSCI. For many years, we have made use of various technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing, to harness the power of Big Data. More recently, our investments to develop MSCI Data Explorer and Data Lake aim to address our clients' strong appetite to ingest rich and extensive data in their operations.  Clients want to leverage our data for a variety of use cases, including custom indices, liquidity reporting, factor analysis, among many others. They also want to easily expose, download and manipulate massive volumes of underlying data for MSCI ESG ratings, SFDR metrics and climate models.  Before I turn the call over to Baer and Andy, I would like to take a few moments to note our current views on the global operating environment. We continue to be encouraged by the global economic recovery underway. While markets may oscillate day-to-day, the underlying trend is a positive one. Accordingly, we are aggressively positioned MSCI to take advantage of its many opportunities, and we will continue to increase our level of investment in the Triple-Crown areas we see for our company.  With that, let me pass the floor over to Baer. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. We have quite a number of exciting areas that I could cover here today, but I will focus my comments on 3: One, our technology strategy and within that, our transition from Beon; two, climate where the market's focus and needs are accelerating; and three, data.  On technology, flexibility is paramount, and we are pursuing a modular open platform strategy across MSCI. As part of our enterprise-wide integrated Investment Solutions-as-a-Service or ISaaS offerings, we are moving our analytics products into modular components, integrated through APIs, and delivered through a consistent client experience. This allows us to offer clients access to offerings from across MSCI on a common infrastructure. Given our plans for and progress with this initiative, as we announced earlier this morning, we are discontinuing our investment in Beon.  Beon was originally conceived to consolidate analytics applications and distribute content in a unified way to our clients. With the investment industry increasingly converging around the use of cloud-based technologies for content production, distribution and consumption, we will instead, over time, offer a range of new experiences through the integration of existing and planned ISaaS services.  On climate, as Henry noted, we continue to enrich our suite of climate data models and tools. Our solutions help investors measure their portfolio companies and assets against emissions and temperature alignment goals, minimize transition risks and physical risks, and identify opportunities associated with the decarbonization of their portfolios.  MSCI's climate tools are strongly resonating with clients, and we have seen robust uptake of our climate value at risk solutions, climate change metrics and climate indexes. MSCI's run rate with climate offerings now totals more than $30 million, up nearly 2.5x year-over-year.  We also continue to launch new tools and products to address the quickly evolving landscape. We recently published a quarterly MSCI net-zero tracker. This tool gauges the level of climate change progress in meeting the 1.5-degree warming target. It currently covers the existing universe of public companies comprising the MSCI All Country World Investable Market Index.  Coming soon, we are introducing an implied temperature rise tool, which provides investors with an indication of how companies in their investment portfolios align to global temperature targets. MSCI is also helping address gaps in climate data in private assets. We have been collaborating with our partner, Burgiss, to source Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon footprint estimates for private companies, and see significant opportunities to serve investors in these markets.  These are all good examples of how MSCI contributes to transparency and standards as investors reallocate capital to lower-carbon assets. Each of these tools is intended to respond to the increasing need for high-quality data sets that clients can access directly or via various tools and applications that MSCI provides or through platforms outside of MSCI.  Henry referenced SFDR, which imposes mandatory ESG disclosure obligations on asset managers and other financial market participants. MSCI has expanded its toolkit of climate data and reporting capabilities to address clients' SFDR-related needs, including issuer-level SFDR metrics for more than 10,000 companies and 175 sovereign issuers. We also provide index-level metrics that enable investors to easily report SFDR indicators for the benchmarks of their financial products.  Given the strong market backdrop and our financial performance year-to-date, we have increased our upturn playbook investments in areas such as ESG and climate, fixed income and private markets as well as to enhance our data and technology capabilities, our research, and our client coverage. As always, we will make these investments in the context of our rigorous Triple-Crown framework.  Let me now turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andrew Wiechmann: Thank you, Baer, and hi, everyone. As Henry and Baer have noted, the exceptional performance in the quarter highlighted the massive strategic opportunities in front of us and our continued ability to execute. We had our best quarter ever for net new recurring subscription sales and have best second quarter on record for recurring subscription sales.  The client coverage footprint investments we've made in targeted subregions are also yielding strong business momentum. In EMEA, we had our best quarter ever for recurring subscription sales, and APAC had its second highest quarter on record for recurring subscription sales.  The operating environment remains constructive, and our sales pipeline remains healthy across products and regions. And we continue to see strong momentum in our key franchises. Index recorded subscription run rate growth of over 11%, marking the 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to experience steady index subscription run rate growth of around 9% within the asset management client segment, complemented by outsized growth within hedge funds, broker dealers and wealth managers, collectively growing approximately 17%.  In the ESG and climate segment, we witnessed a further acceleration of growth as we continue to broaden adoption and use cases within existing clients, while successfully expanding into new clients with over half of subscription sales in the quarter coming from new clients to ESG and climate.  In all other private assets, run rate and revenue growth both benefited from solid new sales growth and FX tailwinds, and revenue growth also benefited from an elevated level of service deliveries relative to last year. I would note that a portion of our real estate business recognizes revenue upon delivery of service and typically sees more revenue in the first half versus second half of the year. Although the timing of the deliveries can shift between quarters, resulting in some swings in year-over-year revenue growth rates.  Turning to asset-based fees, where revenue grew 55% year-over-year, the strong market rally as well as healthy cash inflows drove record AUM levels with continued strength both in developed markets outside the U.S. and within U.S. exposures. On a product level, ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and climate equity indexes experienced cash inflows of nearly $17 billion during the quarter, continuing to represent the leading market share of global ESG and climate equity ETF flows.  Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.97 billion after issuing $600 million of notes in May. Our strong balance sheet affords us flexibility to support both organic investments in our business and other capital allocation opportunities. This includes actively pursuing both partnerships and potential acquisitions in key strategic growth areas. It also includes shareholder capital return, including dividends, which continue to grow with adjusted EPS. Yesterday, MSCI's Board approved a 33% increase to our quarterly dividend to $1.04 per share.  As we go forward, I would like to highlight that we continue to monitor the market and may raise additional debt, if we see an attractive opportunity to do so.  Before I turn to guidance, I'll review the impact of the Beon write-down, which was included in amortization of intangible assets. As a reminder, this was a $16 million noncash pretax charge that has been excluded from adjusted EPS. Importantly, it does not impact the opportunities we see for our business nor our high single digit long-term revenue growth target for analytics that we shared with you at our Investor Day in February.  Turning to our guidance. As we mentioned throughout the first half of this year and at Investor Day, our pace of investment may flex up and down based on the trajectory of our asset-based fees and the business more broadly. The strong trajectory year-to-date in equity markets and ETF AUM, exceptional top line growth and ongoing improvement in the macro backdrop give us further confidence to execute on our upturn playbook opportunities and continue to drive growth. Additionally, the strong business performance has led to increases in incentive compensation accruals. We've therefore increased our expense guidance range. We would note, however, that we remain committed to driving positive operating leverage and modest margin expansion.  Our increased interest expense guidance range takes into account our May notes offering of $600 million. And our depreciation and amortization expense guidance reflects the noncash write-off of $16 million from Beon in this quarter, partially offset by the benefit from the removal of projected amortization expense associated with Beon in the second half of 2021.  We reduced our tax rate guidance, taking into account the second quarter and our latest view on a number of discrete items, and we increased our free cash flow guidance primarily to reflect our strong asset-based fees in collections in the first half of the year, as well as lower interest expense, partially offset by higher operating expenses and cash taxes. In summary, we continue to monitor risks from the pandemic, but are encouraged by the improving economic backdrop. We are pleased with the strong quarter we delivered, the investments we continue to make in our growing franchise, and the many opportunities we see ahead of us.  And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: My first question is just on the decision to stop the Beon initiative. I guess, the high single-digit long-term growth rate, I think I can appreciate that stays the same. But I think Beon was supposed to be the difference between that and low double digits in the past. Do you think low double digits is now out of the question for the analytics business? Just curious on the moving pieces there.
Baer Pettit: Manav, Baer here. So look, no, we -- in fact, I think the path that we're on now is one that is much more likely to lead to stronger results across MSCI as a whole and in analytics. So if you look back in time, before Jigar joined as CTO, we developed applications in a very product-specific environment and in a rather siloed way from a technology point of view. So subsequent to his joining and bringing in various new leadership, we were basically in a position where we were ready to launch Beon.  But in parallel, we had created or are in the process of creating a much more industry standard, MSCI standard common architecture and infrastructure that will be used, for example, in launching our index builder and that will be used for our new ESG manager.  So we're going to use that common infrastructure for analytics. It's less idiosyncratic. It is much more industry standard. And it's much more one MSCI. And we're very confident that in doing so, we can create a great user experience for our clients going forward, and that the opportunities for analytics will be the same or greater than we had previously assumed.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the climate business you talked about, I mean, obviously, some pretty good growth, and I can understand the focus given all the press out there. But do you have the tool set to keep that growth going? Or is that where maybe partnerships and M&A will play a role as well?
Baer Pettit: Well, look, partnerships and M&A certainly play a role in everything we do, but our organic investments are the absolutely key thing here. We really believe that we have a lot of the right data, infrastructure and talent to make this happen. We -- as you know, we had made an acquisition in the climate field roughly, again, 18 months ago. I can be corrected. Time flies. But on top of that, the key thing we want to do is to invest in our people, in our models, in our data coverage. And we believe, if we do so, we have a very attractive opportunity ahead in this category.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alexander Kramm: I want to ask a question that I think I asked maybe last quarter already, but definitely have asked in the past, which is the impact of new regulations having on ESG and climate growth. When I've asked you previously, you've kind of said that new regs like SFDR is not having an impact on new sales, et cetera. But clearly, you started talking about it a little bit more.  So I guess my question is, are regulations helping? And if they're not helping yet, do you expect that, that could drive maybe acceleration from these high growth rates in the future? When we talk to some of your competitors, they're definitely acknowledging that regulation is a game changer. So maybe you can comment on that.
Baer Pettit: Yes. Sure, Alex. So look, maybe we understated it somewhat in the past or maybe it was a point of emphasis. But look, you're absolutely right. And by the way, this is changing rapidly, right? So I don't know when we last made that statement, that it's a rapidly changing environment. And for sure, the regulatory demands are driving increasing amounts of uptake for transparency from corporations. We're reporting from banks and risk management from banks, from reporting from asset managers. So we definitely think that this is an area that is going to drive a lot of growth for us. And it's both -- I would say, it's an exciting opportunity because it brings together both the new information, the new models, the new data that we have in climate. But as you know, we have been in the regulatory risk reporting and other reporting for many years.  So I think it's a really great opportunity for us to bring together our traditional risk management capabilities with the new climate emphasis, which plays to both of those strengths.
Alexander Kramm: Okay. Thanks for acknowledging it finally, I guess. Secondarily, just as a quick one, but you highlighted the CalSTRS win, and maybe that's small or not. But like on the one hand, good that you're replacing some of -- some competitors, I guess. But I'm curious, is there a network effect or something like this? And I don't know how much CalSTRS outsources investments. But does somebody like a CalSTRS switching their, I guess, primary benchmark now drive incremental sales for maybe some of the asset managers that are trying to sell to them? Or is this kind of like one-off and doesn't really have a network effect? Maybe you could flesh it out a little bit.
Henry Fernandez: It definitely has a fairly large network effect, and that's one of the reasons why we focus so much energy on this benchmark wins, as we call them, or benchmark displacements. And there is a little bit of revenue associated with the asset owner when they do this. But much more importantly to us is all the investment products that come out of that by either the active or the passive managers, ETFs, futures and options, et cetera.  So in the case of CalSTRS itself, they -- as you know, they're the second largest pension fund in the United States, largest teachers' pension fund in the world, 11th largest pension fund in the world as well. And they run about $175-or-so billion -- I'm sorry, $150 billion of assets under management in equities out of a total of over $300 billion of assets. And of that $150 billion, we were already benchmarked internationally on half of that. The other half of about $75 billion is now coming to an MSCI benchmark, displacing a domestic benchmark. And a lot of that money will be managed passively by asset manager, by index managers, and therefore, it will have a direct effect to our revenues in asset-based fees, right?
Alexander Kramm: Right. But this is a custom index, right? So I guess, it's new custom sales coming out of that. That was my point, right?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, yes. Obviously, the direct revenues from the creation of a custom index is there, but the monetization of this is largely at the asset manager level, not on the asset owner level. But whether it's a standard benchmark off the shelf or a custom benchmark or a thematic benchmark or an ESG benchmark, the concept that I just described applies across the board.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Your cash balance is up to roughly $2 billion. And historically, you've been opportunistic with repurchases. And, I guess, there haven't been too many opportunities to repurchase stock. So that probably led to the 33% dividend increase. So just help us understand, just given the large cash balance, just update us on your capital deployment priorities. And if you were to look at M&A, would it be sort of more tuck-in and what type of assets you'd be looking at?
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. It's Andy. I would say no major change to our approach to capital allocation more broadly. We continue to pay a regular dividend, which generates a steady return of capital. And then we use the balance of excess cash for opportunistic share repurchases and opportunistic MP&A.  On the share repurchase front, as you know, we really factor in 3 components. One is, firstly, volatility in the shares. Secondly is value in the shares. And thirdly is availability of cash. And so we continue to use that discipline around the pace at which we repurchase our shares.  On the MP&A question, I would say we continue to be active in pursuing both acquisitions and partnerships. And our focus is really intensely on strategic growth areas for the firm. And so it's the areas you've heard us talk about in areas like real estate, private equity, ESG and climate, as well as in areas like fixed income. And within those categories, generally looking at assets that have unique and proprietary data as well as analytics and workflow software applications. And so no major changes.  I'd say, generally, we're focused on -- we call them strategic accelerators, which you might call bolt-ons, but it's acquisitions that are going to further our kind of current strategic endeavors, not be transformative-type acquisitions.
Toni Kaplan: Great. Also wanted to ask about your fee rate on the ETF business moved down a little bit over the past few quarters -- 2 quarters. Is this a matter of more funds hitting the caps or is it the U.S. mix element? Or just any other factors that would explain that?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. Toni, it's really, I think, the complex equation, I would say, that the decline in bps this quarter was really a combination of both mix shift and fee changes. And the mix shift equation is quite dynamic. To your point, there's geographical factors that can drive moves either up or down. There can be product area shifts. So if there are big disproportionate shifts into ESG and factor in certain areas that can also influence the overall rate. And then as you said, it can be just a broader blend of products that do have a varied range of fees.  And then the fee changes sometimes can be just -- and usually is the case, it's contractual changes that can adjust based on AUM levels. And sometimes, our partners are adjusting fees to just better position products in the market. So I'd say all of those considerations factored into the move this quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.
Owen Lau: So at the Investor Day, MSCI estimated that TAM of ESG is about $3.9 billion. So given the recent trend in ESG and client mix, do you think the TAM has expanded, especially when we start talking about climate being somehow separate from ESG? And also please remind us how MSCI estimate the TAM?
Henry Fernandez: It certainly is increasing and increasing rapidly. As we have seen in the last 18 months, there's been a huge embrace of ESG investing in the world, and some of the evidence of that have been the performance of the ETFs that are linked to MSCI ESG indices as one example, but you could see that in institutional passive and active management, et cetera. And therefore, the addressable market of ESG investing is going to continue to increase.  And people ask us all the time, how far? Well, I think ultimately, there won't be any such thing as ESG investing. Every investment decision that is made needs to be taking ESG into account. So the addressable market will be the entire global investing process.  With respect to climate, it's the same, and it could be even bigger than ESG. ESG, clearly, is very important to the world, but climate is an existential threat to the world and it needs to be solved in the next 20, 30 years and a lot of solving needs to be front-ended, because as we know markets are discounting mechanisms, and they're going to start and they have already started discounting carbonizing companies and penalizing them, and putting more money into green technology, clean energy and less carbonizing companies.  So the market, the TAM for climate tools is going to be the same. Every investment needs to take climate emissions into account; every company that you invest in, private, public; every real estate investment that you make, especially in real estate in coastal cities; every bond; everything. So I think the addressable market is extremely large.  Now in terms of we, at MSCI, will spend a great deal of time trying to measure and report on that time and the sort of the comments and goings of that. We don't think it's a very useful exercise. It's just huge, and we're just at the early, early stages of penetration of all of that.
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. Just to put a finer point on that, Owen, to your question about how we came up with the TAM that you referenced, it very much was what I like to call a tangible addressable market. So as looking at each client type and then cohorts within those client types, what are they willing to pay for the products that we have today based on the largest sales that we can generate with each of those client categories. And then we extrapolate to, if we were able to sell to each of the clients in those cohorts, how big would that be.  To Henry's point, what that misses is new use cases, new client types and new products that we continue to issue in climate scenario, given how new it is, where we're just not even starting to gauge how big the opportunity can be within -- in any single client and then ultimately across all the potential products that we can issue.
Owen Lau: Got it. That's very, very helpful. A quick follow-up on the cryptocurrency index. Could you please talk about MSCI's interest in relaunching any cryptocurrency impacts? Do you think MSCI [indiscernible]
Henry Fernandez: Yes. Very good question. Let me just start by saying that we, at MSCI, as you all know, are at the nexus, at the leading edge of the investment process between asset owners, managers and financial intermediaries. And therefore, a lot of our clients always come to us first with new ideas, new concepts that are not even beginning to be invested in. So we are always exploring every single type of opportunity about enhancing our tools and our investment products and services for taking clients to that leading edge of investing.  Examples are obviously thematic investing. And obviously, with where we're talking about emerging market investments over the decades and all of that. So cryptocurrency is one example of that. That we've had a number of institutional clients come to us and say, tell us more about this? How could I make an investment in this? What are the potential implications of this to climate, for example? I mean, there is a lot of carbon emission associated with the mining of cryptocurrencies. What is the disruption associated with the underlying blockchain technology? And who are the winners and losers? Et cetera. So it's a broader sort of universe and ecosystem that's just cryptocurrency.  So we are evaluating all of that, analyzing that. We're talking to a lot of experts. We're looking for partnerships with some of those experts in order to then launch a variety of models and data and indices per se as well, and more to come over the next few months about all that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities.
Simon Clinch: I'd love to follow-up on the climate business as well. Could you remind me, in terms of the split of how -- of your customers of the ESG and the climate side, between the providers of capital, financial intermediaries and uses of capital, what is the actual split there?  And on the corporate side in particular, where I think companies are really sort of only now just starting to get the grips with collecting the data for climate and reporting it, how -- what is your -- I think the right word is market share. But in terms of how many of those companies do you actually touch that are actually delivering and already reporting that kind of information?
Baer Pettit: Yes. So Simon, I don't have all of the data in front of me, but we take the picture and then we can flex that out further. So the main historic relationship is between the asset managers and the asset owners that we play. And the -- that is both the adoption of information and benchmarks to create portfolios. And I would say that the -- roughly the balance of revenues between the asset owners and the asset managers is roughly the same. And [indiscernible] new opportunities...
Henry Fernandez: Let me -- Baer, let me interrupt you, if you don't mind, because your call is -- your line is broken. If you want to dial back in and let me answer the question while you do that. So the first thing to recognize is that the climate tools apply to everyone: asset owners, managers, banks and obviously, corporates and the like. So we are present across the entire spectrum.  So the -- it starts, obviously, with helping the asset owner, the pension fund, the endowment, the foundation, the sovereign wealth fund, understand how are they going to decarbonize their portfolios. And therefore, we do a lot of work, a lot of research as to how -- what do they intend to do there. And especially, what kind of policy benchmarks they need to have that are going to measure the impact of that.  So that is a benchmark win, similarly to what we talked about in the context of the CalSTRS transition, but -- not in climate, but in terms of in general. And it doesn't generate a significant amount of revenue at that point. But then, that benchmark then gets into operation by the asset owner looking for the asset managers that are going to run portfolios according to this Paris aligned, for example, climate indices and the like. And therefore, that's the way we're monetizing that.  So a great deal of revenues, currently, the majority -- large majority of our revenue come from asset managers that are helping the asset owners run climate-aligned portfolios. In the last couple of years, there's been -- particularly the last 18 months, we've had a rapidly growing presence with banks in which a lot of the banks are incorporating climate into their capital markets in terms of green bonds, for example, and IPOs and all of that. They're also creating a variety of investment vehicles like swaps and options and all of that. And clearly, they are incorporating climate into their equity research area.  So in summary, right now, the majority of the revenue asset managers, probably second best -- second number is banks and growing rapidly. And then thirdly is the asset owner. But the importance of the asset owner is way beyond the revenue because they're the one that started the food chain in imposing this.  We also have an increasing amount of revenue coming from corporates because we're helping corporates understand their carbon footprint, how is it that they need to disclose their own carbon data, how is it that they can measure their temperature alignment and the like.
Andrew Wiechmann: And just to give you some figures on that. Of the $30 million of climate run rate that Baer mentioned earlier, about $9-and-change million is coming from asset-based fees, which is, by its nature, almost entirely asset managers. And then of the balance, the subscription portion, as Henry said, it is the largest -- the majority of that is coming from asset managers as well.
Simon Clinch: Okay. Great. That's very useful. And if I might just fit in just one question. Just quickly on retention rates overall. I'm just wondering, is there anything -- any changes or any dynamics going on in the market that's causing a bit more volatility in, say, the analytics retention rate that you've seen?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. I'd say no notable changes this quarter. As we've said in the past, analytics will tend to be a little bit lumpier where we, in certain periods, may have large cancellations and it can bounce around. I'd say there were no client segment specific indicators of note within analytics or across any of the other segments here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital.
Ashish Sabadra: Congrats on a solid quarter. I had two questions on ESG. I'll ask them both upfront. First one is just on the competitive environment on ESG. Obviously, you have S&P with acquisition of IHS Markit increasing their presence there, but also there's just a lot more consolidation happening in the space. So how do you expect that competitive environment to evolve as we -- going forward? So that's one.  And second is there was -- the global regulator, IOSCO, is looking to regulate the ESG rating providers, And do you expect that to -- or do you expect that to have any influence on the market going forward? And how does that help MSCI acquisition much better?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So our ESG offering, in terms of competitive positioning, is extremely advantageous because it's across the whole spectrum. We are the only provider of ESG tools that goes from ESG screening, ESG ratings, ESG indices, incorporation of ESG into factor models. We're doing all of that across the equity spectrum. We have significantly expanded our capabilities in the whole fixed income sector as well for ESG, especially in the partnership with Bloomberg and Barclays for us -- for index funds and the like. So quite a broad category.  And in terms of competition, a lot of the competition that we have is in the various sectors. So there are certain competitors in the screening part, there are other competitors on ratings, and the like. We are the largest provider, by far, of ESG indices, both equity and fixed income. So there is competition, but not as much compared to the screening part, for example. And we are among a few, if not the only one, that is incorporating ESG as a factor and risk model and ESG in analytics reporting for portfolios.  So we believe that the summation of all of this and the availability of all these tools is going to make us win over the competition over time. Clearly, there will be more competitors coming our way. But we believe that given our leadership and given our completeness of the product line, that will be an advantage to us.  The regulation is coming. There are a lot of securities commissioned around the world that are trying to see what gets included in terms of ESG in some of these indices and especially in the investment products. So I think there's direct regulation and indirect regulation. It will -- it has started with indirect regulation, meaning the clients that we license our indices to are being regulated, have been regulated. So they need to report certain things, and we need to help them with that. And then there may be direct regulation of the index providers or the ESG rating entities.  Regulation is always a winner for us because it shrinks the number of competitors in the market because we have the ability to deal with the regulation and scale up our business dramatically, create efficiencies in doing that. So that is something that we don't necessarily ask for or push for it. But when it comes, it's a competitive advantage for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.
Craig Huber: My first question, can you just touch on further the futures and options area and the opportunity there you see going forward here? And maybe touch on maybe some more partnerships with some of the exchanges out there globally? And I have a follow-up.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So this is an area that we are extremely focused on growing and building. It's a lot of white space. As you know, listed index futures and options around the world are largely domestic, meaning country exposures. And in the cases that, that is multi-country exposure, they're single currency, like in the Eurozone with the euro. So we are developing with our partners the exchanges the market for multi-country, multi-currency index futures and options and have been added for a bit of time.  We have been very successful in futures, as we reported in the past. We are looking to expand that in not only -- continue with the market cap indices in equities, but with ESG indices, for example, climate change indices, and so on and so forth.  The area that we're now very focused on, which is because it's very small and incipient, is listed options. The market for the multi-country multi-currency-listed, index-listed options is very, very small. We think it can be a huge market. We're taking steps to strengthen our partnerships in developing that, especially in the U.S.  As you have noticed this quarter, index futures and options and the licensing fees that we generate from that are definitely countercyclical to the AUM levels, and that is one area that we're focused on because we -- as the AUM -- if you have a bull market and the AUM goes up dramatically in the ETF and index -- other index products, there may be a lot less volatility, and therefore, a lot lower volume in these areas. But the other way around is also going to happen when you have a bearish markets or highly volatile markets, we will be making a lot more money in derivatives compared to the cash products.  So that's something that we're doing it not only because it's a great growth area and revenue, but also in order to diversify this great all-weather franchise that we have at MSCI.
Andrew Wiechmann: And Craig, one point to keep in mind there, as Henry alluded to, volumes have been light given the low volatility in the market generally. But one very encouraging trend for us is the continued growth in open interest in futures contracts based on our indexes, which is up 50% year-over-year. So we continue to see kind of healthy adoption and use of the products despite the lower volatility.
Craig Huber: I appreciate that. My other quick question, if I could ask, on your hedge fund business. Can we just touch on that how well that's doing? How do you feel about the health of that market? And are they adopting your products?
Baer Pettit: Yes. So I would say that there is not a fundamental change from previous quarters. There's been nothing that has changed dramatically since we last spoke. It's -- there's been -- I would say, we have good growth in index. It's a little more patchy -- and good growth in ESG. There's not really been a change in the environment as it relates to analytics. So I think the main headline is no dramatic change since the last time we spoke.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: A question for you on the upturn playbook and the investments in the business. I guess, just remind us there, how quickly can you guys turn up and turn down those investments? And are these investments more on people, or is it in technology? How should we think about that over the next several quarters?
Andrew Wiechmann: Sure. Yes. So there typically is a little bit of a lag, especially when the driver of the upturn is asset-based fees, which can move up quite significantly in a short period of time. And while we can bring in some expenses, namely some non-comp expenses, the comp expenses take some time to ramp up here. And so we are, as you know, going to actively our upturn playbook now. As we've said in the past, the asset-based fees continue to grow at a very rapid growth rate, and the broader business health continues to be quite strong. And so that's the driver of our guidance going up where we are turning to the upturn here, and it's investing both in people and key areas as well as technology and other non-comp areas.  I would highlight 2 other factors that relate to the all-weather franchise that we have. One is around compensation, where just based on the better business performance that we're seeing relative to where we started the year, compensation accruals naturally go up. I would highlight that the opposite happens when we enter a challenging period. And so that's a kind of nice all-weather franchise hedge.  And similarly, on the FX side. So we have seen some FX headwinds on the expense side as the dollar has depreciated against several currencies. And so that's put some pressure on the year-to-date expenses as well as factored into the guidance. And that's something that also moves in the opposite direction sometimes. The nice thing about that is we get an offset on the revenue side. So we have benefited a bit on the revenue side from the U.S. dollar depreciation.  If I can spend just a minute highlighting where the investments are going, these are really around the key growth areas of the firm. So we are very much sticking to our Triple-Crown framework and putting the incremental dollars to those areas that are going to drive growth for us. So an index, it's areas like the new index platform, innovative new index, product development. In ESG, significant investments, which you can see just based on the ESG expense growth rate, where we are using some of this improved business performance to really double down in ESG. So we're investing in areas like data sourcing and data quality as well, as Baer alluded to earlier, our new ESG platform, ESG manager platform, and then go to market on the sales side. And then more generally, in the technology area, continuing to invest in our cloud migration in areas like DevOps. So it's similar messages to what we've delivered in the past, just we're enacting that right now to a higher extent.
Keith Housum: Great. And just a follow-up question, if I may. Assuming that businesses do come back in line and employees come back to work, how does that affect your business? Is there anything you weren't able to do over the past year because customers weren't there or you guys weren't in the office, that perhaps gives you a new opportunity assuming we go back -- people go back to work before the end of the year?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So the impact that we had last year, for example, in the lockdown was in the large enterprise analytics deals that require a fairly large coordination in the client organization between the C level and the mid levels and the more junior levels. So a lot of that dried up for us. It's gradually returning, but it's not at the level that we have seen it in the past. So that will be a benefit as people come back to the office. Overall, in general, we have done exceptionally well in a virtual world. In general, our clients are being very receptive. We've been -- except for the large enterprise deals, and the implementation of those deals, by the way, the implementation fees, which we normally recognize when we're putting all of that. Once the sale is done, when we put all of that to work, that has slowed down significantly. So the 2 areas that just to summarize that we were hurt were the large sales in enterprise analytics and the implementation, and therefore, the recognition of those fees.  But in general, after that, we've been very effective at communicating with clients, relating to clients, and internally, the productivity levels of our people working virtually has gone through the roof. It's been quite a great experience in the context of a horrible pandemic with a lot of loss of lives and disruption in people's lives and employment.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alexander Kramm: Sorry for dragging out the call. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, Andy, you talked about preserving operating leverage and margin expansion. So can you just remind us, when you think longer term, do you actually have a range in terms of margin expansion that you think about? I know you've laid out subscription growth and EBITDA cost growth, but like where does that arrive in terms of margin expansion on an annual basis?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. And it's a very dynamic equation. So we have not been prescriptive about targeted operating leverage or margin expansion. There are going to be periods, like we've seen in the last couple of quarters, where ABF just runs up significantly, and we can't adjust our pace of investment to keep up with it, and you'll see the margin go up. Similarly, there will likely be periods at some point where the market goes in the opposite direction, and we continue to invest. And we might see at times the margin go down in periods. But our longer-term objective is to drive that positive operating leverage. And as we've said, it's going to be at a more modest pace than what we've seen in the future. Our core focus here is driving long-term growth. And to do that, we want to continue to invest at a healthy rate.
Alexander Kramm: So not willing to put numbers around what modest means from a long-term perspective? Am I getting it right?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. You've seen our long-term targets and what we've said on the expense side. And yes, I haven't been more prescriptive than that.
Alexander Kramm: Fair. And then just one quick follow-up to the competition question on ESG and climate, maybe particularly on climate. And not to single out one firm in particular, but I know you have a big relationship with BlackRock in a lot of areas. And I think they are also talking a lot about climate and when it relates to the Aladdin products, et cetera. Like is that more of a partnership? Or are you viewing them as a competitor when it comes to these climate opportunities and climate modeling?
Henry Fernandez: So it's the same as the overall relationship with BlackRock, which is, on one hand, we're strong partners in index and all the tools, all the climate tools and models and all of that, that go into construction of indices. On the other hand, clearly, their analytics business competes with our analytics business, and embedded in there are a number of models and tools and analytics and reporting and all of that. So that is obviously a bit more competitive.  But having said that, one of the things to emphasize is MSCI is an open architecture company. And therefore, all of our content is available in any platform that wants to work with us, even if those platforms are in competition with our own software platforms. So in that vein, we have a number of collaborations and partnership with BlackRock in their analytics Aladdin business in terms of putting a lot of our content, ESG content, climate content and climate models and all of that, in their platform. So there is an element of partnership there as well in the context of the competition on the overall workflow software and platforms.
Operator: There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Henry Fernandez, CEO and Chairman, for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Well, thank you for joining us today. As you have heard, we have enormous opportunities in front of us at MSCI. Therefore, we're stepping up our pace of investing, and at the same time, obviously, try to achieve some modest margin expansion. We like the revenue growth that we've achieved and the performance, and we're going to like it even more if we invest more to achieve even higher levels of revenue growth. So we look forward to speaking with you further. In the meantime, please enjoy your summer, and stay safe.
Operator: This concludes the conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Sallilyn Schwartz: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter 2021. This press release, along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. And are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we will also refer to non-GAAP measures including, but not limited to, organic operating revenue growth rate, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures, in the appendix of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time, the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detailed in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We, therefore, caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenue. Additionally, we will discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions]. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. When we spoke at our Investor Day in February, I pointed to our 50-plus year track record of building standards and our continued role in transforming the global investment world. MSCI's mission remains to enable investors build better portfolios for a better world. Our excellent first quarter performance demonstrates the financial benefits of our mission, and the ongoing strategic and disciplined investments we have made in the client experience in our client segments and in our solutions and capabilities. For the quarter, we achieved total revenue growth of 15%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 21%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 30%. We also generated free cash flow of $205 million, doubling year-over-year. At Investor Day, my colleagues and I spoke about MSCI's strategy to support the investment process needs of various client segments with highly differentiated solutions, supported by best-in-class capabilities. I would like to highlight recent selected advancements within each of these areas. Within clients, I would like to emphasize the wealth management segment, where industry trends toward digitalization, the signing of model portfolios, an incorporated sustainability criteria, continue to drive significant demand for MSCI's offerings. A growing interest in direct indexing in wealth management is creating opportunities for MSCI. This personalized portfolio solutions leverage MSCI's models, data and technology from across the entire franchise, including our index capabilities, optimization tools and ESG and climate data. Staying on clients, let me also touch on corporates, our newest client segment, where we now serve 53 corporate issuers, 42 corporate adviser entities and 2 distribution platforms. We continue to see strong corporate interest related to our ESG and climate offerings. Corporate needs range from benchmarking against underlying ESG and climate data to licensing our ESG ratings for new sustainability-link financings. I would like now to highlight our progress expanding and deepening our solutions in climate change, which is increasingly recognized as an existential threat to our planet and a major investment and portfolio risk. Put simply, we believe that addressing the impacts of climate change will require the largest reconstruction of the global economy since the industrial revolution. Capital markets are an essential and critical force to drive the transition to a net zero world with considered actions from all participants. These actions range from a reallocation of capital by asset owners, effective channeling of funds by asset managers and banks to greener investments and innovation, to decarbonizing operations by companies. Last week, my colleagues and I put forth our call to action to all participants in the global investment community to support a net zero revolution. We urge asset owners and asset managers to decarbonize their portfolios, effect change on companies through voting and shareholder engagement and transition to investment policy benchmarks that reflect a path to net 0. Providers, users and intermediaries of capital have a fundamental responsibility to reduce their impact on the planet and join the journey to a decarbonized economy as quickly as possible. Failure to identify the investment opportunities and risks related to climate change will result in missed opportunities and avoidable losses. We're also holding ourselves to the same high standards. MSCI, as a company, recently committed to reach net zero carbon emissions before 2040. This commitment is in addition to our prior pledge to reduce by 2025, our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 50%, and our Scope 3 emissions by 20%. This past quarter, we also became an official supporter of the TCFD. We integrated climate risks into our internal risk management framework and announced our commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As we said in our call to action, the time to act is now. Regulators, asset owners and managers and societies are all encouraged to adopt and adapt a net zero emissions targets, especially before the COP26 Conference later this year. Supporting the investment industry as it undertakes this enormous paradigm shift makes investing in our climate franchise, a critical Triple-Crown investment priority. At MSCI, we have an enormous opportunity to be a leading provider of all the necessary data, models and technology to help all capital market participants accelerate this significant economic transformation. Let me now turn to our critical capabilities, where I would like to highlight a recent strategic development. Last week, we announced a strategic collaboration with Royalty Pharma plc, the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the life sciences industry. Together, we will develop thematic indices for the biotech and biopharma megatrend. Royalty Pharma will provide MSCI with expertise on various medical conditions, clinical trials, transformative therapies, and technologies that may lead to breakthrough medical treatments. This knowledge and expertise will assist MSCI in the design of a classification framework and in index methodologies. Just as MSCI has become a standard in market cap weighted indices, we are building a strong brand in nonmarket cap weighted indices, including ESG, climate and factor indices and now thematic indices, capturing the major megatrend opportunities in the world. If you consider the sizable business, we have built in market cap weighted indices and the significantly larger. And broader range of applications for nonmarket cap indices, you can quickly see why we are so excited about these opportunities. You already have a sense for the potential for ESG, climate and factor indices. Let me, therefore, take a minute to describe what we believe is possible with thematic indexes. Our thematic indexes provide investors already made way to tap into societal megatrends that are creating both disruption and opportunities. The 3 most significant megatrends we have identified include high tech, for which we have partnered with ARK Invest; Biotech, for which we have now this new partnership with Royalty Pharma; and clean energy, an increasing area of focus for investors and therefore, for MSCI. You will see us continue to build partnerships in these areas and others to ensure we have access to best-in-class subject matter expertise. Before I turn the call over to Baer and Andy, I'll take a few moments to describe our observations on our global operating environment. Notwithstanding the ongoing risks associated with the continued pandemic, the rollout of vaccines provides hope for our collective health and will unleash unprecedented pent-up economic activity starting in the U.S. Many financial markets are already reflecting this expectation. MSCI is very well positioned to benefit from this in addition to the secular trends that are accelerating MSCI's opportunity set. We need to continue to scale MSCI to ensure we appropriately capitalize on these significant opportunities ahead of us. As we continue through 2021, we remain deeply committed to investing responsibly in Triple-Crown opportunities in order to leverage and build on the established scale of our business. We are confident we can continue to create long-term value for all of our various stakeholders. With that, I will now like to turn the call over to Baer. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. I'll echo Henry's enthusiasm for the strong momentum with which we've started the year. Total subscription sales across MSCI reached a first quarter record high. Asset-based fees also achieved a milestone, surpassing $500 million in run rate. As I highlighted during our Investor Day presentation, our very deep client relations are central to our successful commercial model. In our 2020 client survey, MSCI's global Net Promoter Score, a leading indicator of client retention and loyalty, increased to 45 points, up 6 points compared to 2019 and above the average scores for the financial services, enterprise software and SaaS industries. In the first quarter of 2021, net new recurring subscription sales were nearly $34 million, growing 46% year-on-year driven by ESG and climate as well as double-digit growth across analytics, index and private assets. Accordingly, MSCI's subscription run rate expanded 11% or nearly $140 million versus the prior year. This included a remarkable 42% increase, or nearly $44 million, in ESG and climate's run rate as well as a more than $60 million increase in index's subscription run rate. MSCI's total retention rate in the first quarter was 96.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. Henry noted our efforts with wealth managers. As you are aware, this is one of our newer but very promising client segments. At the end of the first quarter, we had a $64 million run rate from wealth managers, up 28% year-over-year. We also continue to see strong growth and continued momentum in our more established client segments. For example, subscription run rate from asset managers and asset owners, which together comprise about 2/3 of total subscription run rate, were up 11% year-over-year. Let me make a few observations about this quarter from a regional point of view. In EMEA, MSCI generated 16% subscription run rate growth, driven by strong growth across product segments, but with particular success in ESG and climate, as the forthcoming COP26 Conference, the need for TCFD reporting and the significant increases in net zero alignment spurred strong client activity. In APAC, new subscription sales are regaining momentum and grew 36% year-over-year in the first quarter. Business activity is returning to normal subsequent to the pandemic. In Japan, opportunities were created by new regulations on liquidity. Total subscription run rate growth was strong across the regions, growing 16%, 9% and 8% year-over-year in EMEA, APAC and the Americas, respectively. On the back of a great start to the year, our global sales pipeline remains healthy across both products and regions as well as above levels of last year. As Henry noted, the rapidly growing attention to climate risk has been a significant contributor to our sales pipeline as MSCI's expertise is well recognized. To that end, we continue to enrich our suite of climate data, models and technology. Let me provide a few examples. Following our successful introduction of MSCI climate scenario analysis models, including climate value at risk, we are developing climate models for new asset classes, including fixed income. We also continue to enrich our data sets, including for Scope 3 emissions and to strengthen our TCFD reporting solutions. We have completed TCFD reporting projects for some of the world's most prominent asset owners and institutions, ranging from climate risk portfolio-level reporting to temperature alignment comparisons to benchmarks. We recently launched MSCI Climate Paris Aligned fixed income indexes, following our successful launches of MSCI fixed income climate indexes and MSCI Climate Paris Aligned equity indexes. Finally, and coming soon, we plan to introduce cloud native climate risk-focused application that showcases MSCI climate models and data. This offering leverages Microsoft tools and AI technology in connection with our broader efforts to deliver investment solutions as a service. As Henry referenced, we are investing to capitalize on the sizable addressable opportunities in climate, including in areas like banks, stress testing and corporate needs to capture climate stress tests. Both have the potential to become mandatory requirements in the future. Overall, MSCI's run rate from climate now totals over $20 million across the franchise. We expect this part of the business to continue to grow rapidly as we help investors evaluate, manage and address climate risk in their portfolios. Before I move on from solutions, I'll provide a brief update on our progress in fixed income. In analytics, our fixed income portfolio management run rate has expanded nearly 60% off a small but very rapidly growing base. We are gaining traction by bringing to market fresh solutions that improve upon the quality of models, workflows and usability of legacy solutions. We're also benefiting from the investments we've made over the years to improve our single security analytics, factor models and performance models. In ESG and climate, we're developing physical risk climate scores for U.S. municipal bonds. We're also building new applications for our Climate Value-at-Risk tool, including for sovereign bonds. In index, we have seen our clients continue to attract assets in fixed income ETFs linked to MSCI and Bloomberg Barclays MSCI indexes. AUM in those ETFs reached more than $20 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2021, growing more than 200% year-over-year. As you can see, our strategy in fixed income is to differentiate ourselves by providing high-quality products that play toward specific areas of strength. Our ability to integrate offerings across the MSCI franchise also continues to be an important differentiating factor and driver for clients to turn to MSCI for fixed income solutions. Across asset classes, products and data, we continue to prioritize an open architecture approach to enhance the client experience and flexibility across MSCI. Recently, we integrated MSCI's ESG research into our hedge platform, such that we can now provide ESG and climate metrics calculated on position-level holdings, allowing hedge funds to support asset owner net zero goals. We're also further enhancing climate data integration capabilities in our risk management platform within analytics. Given the strong momentum with which we've begun this year, we have accelerated the pace of our investments in key growth areas such as ESG and climate, fixed income and private markets to enhance our data, research, technology and client coverage. As always, we will make these investments in the context of our rigorous Triple-Crown framework. Let me now turn the call over to Andy. He will speak more to our outlook as part of his review of our guidance as well as further discuss our recent financial performance. Over to you, Andy.
Andrew Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hi, everyone. As Henry and Baer noted, we are encouraged by the favorable economic and market backdrop, and we are seeing a fairly healthy client environment. We're excited by the strong start to the year and the momentum we have developed across the business. In index, we recorded subscription run rate growth of nearly 11%, now marking the 29th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And as Baer noted, asset-based fee run rate surpassed $500 million. In analytics, we saw a nice improvement in the retention rate to a record level, underscoring the leading and mission-critical nature of our solutions. Furthermore, analytics continues to be a key enabler of our integrated franchise by helping build and distribute products in index, ESG and climate and private assets, ranging from calculation tools to modeling engines, and flexible content delivery. This was the first quarter we presented ESG and climate and all other private assets at separate reportable segments. ESG and climate experienced a further acceleration in growth, growing 38% in revenue and 42% in run rate. Run rate in all other private assets, which currently consists of our real estate business, grew 15% as we are seeing strong traction with our revamped enterprise analytics offering in Europe. We showed operating leverage across all segments during the quarter. In index and ESG and climate, revenue growth outpaced investment spending. And in analytics and real estate, we had relatively flat expenses benefiting from continued savings in lower travel and entertainment expenses. Within our asset-based fee revenue, we saw solid performance across all components, with 27% growth year-over-year, fueled by exceptional growth in ETFs linked to our indexes. Assets under management and ETFs linked to our indexes reached a record level of more than $1.2 trillion at quarter end and a further record of approximately $1.26 trillion as of last Thursday. The exceptional growth in AUM during the quarter was driven by cash inflows of nearly $62 billion into equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, representing 23% of all cash inflows into equity ETFs with continued strength in both developed markets outside the U.S. and emerging market exposures, where we captured more than 30% and 50% of all inflows during the quarter, respectively. On a product level, ETFs linked to MSCI, ESG and climate equity indexes experienced cash inflows of nearly $25 billion during the quarter, representing 70% market share of all global ESG and climate equity ETF flows. We are pleased to see the broader adoption of factor objectives with $10 billion of inflows into value and momentum factor ETFs linked to our indexes, which more than offset the flows we saw out of minimum volatility products. Our strong commercial and top line success during the quarter translated into strong financial results. Our 30% adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year was primarily driven by the significant revenue growth with additional benefits from operating leverage and share repurchases at attractive prices. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.75 billion after issuing $500 million of notes due 2030 at a coupon of 3.58%. In mid-April, we used the offering proceeds along with cash on hand to redeem all $500 million of our 2026 notes that had a coupon of 4.75%. Pro forma for the redemption, we had about $1.2 billion of cash and a total debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.3x, within our targeted range of 3.0 to 3.5x. With our leverage in the middle of our targeted range, I want to highlight that we continue to monitor the markets and may raise additional debt if we see an attractive opportunity. We continue to be highly confident in our capital position and our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We remain focused on reinvesting in the business as a first priority, dividends growing with adjusted EPS and truly opportunistic MP&A and share repurchases with a strong focus on maximizing returns to shareholders. This quarter, we returned more than $200 million to shareholders through dividends as well as share repurchases at an average price per share of $407.70. I'll now turn to our guidance. As we mentioned last quarter and at Investor Day, our pace of investment may flex up or down based on the trajectory of our asset-based fees. More specifically, we highlighted that our initial expense guidance was based on the assumption of relatively flat market levels for the year. The strong trajectory year-to-date with AUM up nearly 15% as of last Thursday together with the favorable outlook gives us confidence to activate our upturn playbook. We have, therefore, increased our expense guidance range, reflecting our intent to continue to invest in Triple-Crown investments to support future growth. As you know, continued investment in Triple-Crown areas remains a top priority for us. At the same time, we remain committed to positive operating leverage and modest margin expansion. We also reduced our tax rate guidance, taking into account the low rate in the first quarter, in large part driven by a windfall benefit from the vesting of stock-based compensation as well as our current view on a number of discrete items. We increased our free cash flow guidance primarily to reflect our strong asset-based fees and collections in the first quarter. In summary, the overall operating environment within many parts of the investment industry is healthier than it has been in recent quarters. And MSCI remains uniquely positioned to help investors across their most mission-critical needs. The first quarter was a very strong start to 2021 for MSCI. While the environment is likely to remain somewhat volatile, we believe we are well positioned for the longer-term with our attractive all-weather business model, client-centric approach and laser-focused on establishing and solidifying standards for the investment industry. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Henry, I was hoping, just on your comments on the thematic side of your priorities. Can you just help size perhaps how big that is for you guys? And how we should think about the potential there, really?
Henry Fernandez: It's fairly large, Manav. And when we sit back and look at the great business that we have built in market cap indices for equities and then we look at what we can build with nonmarket cap indices ranging from ESG and climate and factors and thematics and the combination of all of that, in equities, and we translate all of that to fixed income and eventually translate all of that to equity and fixed income together in balanced indices, the opportunity is massive. And if you were to think about the ultimate goal is every investor has a portfolio, and every portfolio needs an index of some sort. So we believe that the opportunity for market cap indices should be much bigger than for what we have built in the opportunity for nonmarket cap indices, it should be much bigger than the opportunity for market cap indices that we've created.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just on capital allocation, right? It sounds like, obviously, Triple-Crown investments remain one, the partnerships, obviously, continue to be a focus to you guys. I was just curious, like, in terms of just outright M&A, like is that - how much of the pipeline or priorities that even for MSCI at the moment.
Henry Fernandez: So we continue to be extremely focused on organic investment opportunities. We have a very wide, deeper and higher range of investment opportunities that we have ever seen, honestly. I think the set of opportunities in all aspects of what we do are accelerating from climate to ESG to nonmarket cap indices to fixed income to what we can do with more technology to the data, especially in ESG and climate, et cetera. So very, very focused on organic investment, and accelerator of the organic investment is clearly the partnerships. We cannot do it all together. So we look for partnership with people that have data, that have models, that have technology, that have distribution, et cetera. Some of those partnerships may involve some investment on our part in their capital structure. That hasn't traditionally been the case, but we may, we're open to that. Now we reviewed the overall sort of M&A landscape. Always, it's a fiduciary duty to do that, both small and large companies. And obviously, we look at it, we analyze it, but we continue to remain very focused on our strategy of building one MSCI with organic investments on selected bolt-on acquisitions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alexander Kramm: I think you may have addressed some of this already, but the strength in ESG and climate sales, can you flesh this out a little bit more? You, obviously, mentioned some of the regulatory changes in Europe, and it seems like they also have benefited. But can you maybe isolate those? Was that a very big contributor? Do you think that's sustainable for the near term? As, I guess, more people have to get ready to comply? Or is it really just more of the same when it comes to ESG sales? So just a little bit more color would be helpful.
Baer Pettit: Sure, Alex. So look, I think, that in terms of ESG, it is an acceleration of the - that everything we've discussed previously on these calls. What was really striking is we had an asset owners' survey in the last quarter. And it's actually in the North America and the U.S. and Canada that ESG and climate are - were the #1 concern of asset owners. So that is, for sure, an important I would say, change or acceleration in addition to the things you mentioned, the regulatory context in Europe, et cetera. And I think the other thing that's clearly happening is the weight of climate increasing in the ESG and climate mix we've had extraordinary amount of interaction with clients related to climate adjusted portfolios, transition risk, 1.5-degree alignment, et cetera. So the ESG trend is strong and is continuous. And the conversations and the client interest related to climate are going up even more dramatically in tandem.
Alexander Kramm: All right. Great. And then secondarily, also coming back to the thematic points that you made this quarter. I guess one of the things I'm curious about is on the market cap weighted indices, you've done a great job, obviously, establishing network effect. And that's why you have great economics there. And in some of those areas of thematic, like factor and ESG, it seems like you're establishing that network effect, and it's very institutional. But in some of those new areas, like, I don't know, high tech and pharma that you talked about, it seems to me a little bit more like retail-ish, and maybe I'm taking the wrong approach here. But I just wonder how easy it is to really establish network effect and actually extract good pricing or if that kind of stuff gets competed away as there may be like 25 different pharma indices and 30 tech indices and nobody really cares what they do. So I guess, just talk to that a little bit more like why you think you would have a special sauce in those areas.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. No, that's a good question, Alex, because we ask ourselves that same question over and over again. And the first thing to note is that there has been significant institutional investor interest in these areas. The way that I normally would explain that is that there are - compared to maybe 10, 20 years ago or so, there are very large structural changes going on in the global economy and the global investment universe that are not totally reflected in market cap indices, for example. So the traditional way that institutional investor invest will be benchmarked to a market cap index at MSCI, for example, on their equity portfolios. But those new areas of clean energy and biotech and more high tech and all of that are not yet reflected in the asset allocation of those indices because they're on the comp. So what we are seeing is a lot of those institutional investors are looking to put a segregated amount of their assets into those themes and those areas in order to sort of anticipate what is going to come in the future. So a lot of what we're doing in this area is largely for institutional investors, not necessarily for retail investors. Hopefully, we'll get that as well, but that's the direction of travel. And therefore, do we believe that we can build a large network effect as it relates to that because it's similar to ESG and climate, a lot of investors are taking parts of their portfolio - institutional investors are taking part of their portfolio and allocating to ESG biased investment products with our indices or climate biased portfolios and the network effect associated with that. So we think we can continue to build that - this powerful franchise across the board. Now the other part of the ecosystem is how do we build benchmark for active indices, for passive, and then the construction also of the development of derivative products whether it's structured products or whether it's over-the-counter options and swaps and listed options and listed futures with the dialogue that we're hiring with our partners in the broker-dealer community and the investment banking community and the exchange community with respect to ESG and climate and thematic is off the chart. It's always been, in the past, market cap weighted indices. The majority of the discussion today is about thematic indices, and it's about ESG and climate indices.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Hopefully, this isn't too much of a repeat of a prior question. But Henry, you mentioned the - with climate, we're looking at a paradigm shift. And so maybe you can just expand on how you see this sort of playing out. So is this a significant bump in the next couple of years as people integrate climate and ESG into their thinking on investing? Or is this something that, over time, you can keep building new solutions and what you do best, like just trying to understand how sustainable this is or if this is just a massive like couple of year growth spurt?
Henry Fernandez: Well, it is fairly front loaded. And the - but it's not front loaded and then it peters out or slows down. We're going to be talking about this for the next 10, 20 years in a big way, point one. Point two is that it cuts across everything we do from indices to analytics. We're repositioning a lot of our analytics for climate impact on - climate risk in the portfolios, climate reporting and all that. It clearly affects the private asset classes. We talked about real estate and how do we decarbonize, how do we look at climate change in the context of properties in cost of cities and all of that and of course, in the ESG climate segment as well. So it cuts across everything that we do. And this is - if you were to think of what is the #1 largest opportunity of MSCI in the next few years and going on for a decade or 2, it will be climate. And therefore, we want to position MSCI as the leading provider or a leading provider of climate solutions to the whole global investment industry as a whole. And we also have an opportunity to expand significantly into the issuer market, which has not been traditionally a place where we have been with corporates and other forms of issuers to help them in this incredible transition that will take place. So this is a massive opportunity for us. And it's not like back dated, it's not like back ended, it's now, and you're seeing the dialogue that is going on. You're seeing the momentum in our sales from, obviously, a very small base, but it's going to be a massive opportunity for us and is now.
Toni Kaplan: That's great. And maybe, Andy, this might be for you. Just looking at the guide for a second. You raised free cash flow by about 5% at the midpoint for the full year. I don't know what your 1Q expectation was, but I'm guessing that 1Q came in better. So just is the higher guide a reflection of the beat? Like why weren't the trends that you saw do really well in 1Q continue for the rest of the year?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Toni. So maybe I can spend a second on Q1 and answer your question about the strong performance, and then I can extrapolate to the full year. As you alluded to, we did have very strong cash flow performance in the first quarter. The story was really around collections for us on 2 fronts. One, business growth was stronger, so very strong growth across the business. But two, also a very strong collection performance for us. The first quarter also we did benefit from some shifts in interest payments, which was affected by the recent financings that we've done but those will normalize throughout the full year. The biggest impact for the full year, to your point, is that the picked up business growth, I think, the collections activity will normalize quarter-to-quarter, but the bigger impact is really just the stronger business growth, which we tried to reflect in the guide.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.
Craig Huber: My first question, can you - Henry, your - can you maybe touch on this. Futures and options, just give us an update there, if you would, please, in terms of going forward, what we should expect there. Are there new additional exchanges, for example, looking to get involved with there? What's like game plan to get this area moving because one of your major competitors, obviously, gets a lot more revenue north of 15% of the revenues from this area and you guys' is much smaller, but it's a heck of an opportunity for you as I view it?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So let me give you the business answer, and then Andy can provide some commentary on the financials. This is an area of significant expansion in all of MSCI with our exchange partners around the world. As we have noted before, most of the market for listed options and futures in the world, it's a single-country, single-currency index futures. And in some cases, when it is multi-country, it's single currency futures and options. So this is an area of prime for innovation, prime for expansion and creativity, which is what we're doing with our exchange partners in all regions of the world. And we're now also increasingly doing certain partnerships in emerging markets. We announced, obviously, our partnership with the Colombian Exchange, for example. We've had a partnership with the Saudi Exchange and the like. So that's something that we'll continue and innovate. While we're now talking to a lot of our exchange partners, as I said in the prior - my prior comments, are how do we go from market cap weighted indices to ESG index futures and options to thematic. We recently launched a China tech index, for example, that we're in the process of licensing to an exchange for listed futures and options. And that would be an example of the expansion of the thematic into derivatives. And the other thing is that all of that is also related to the activity we have with banks and broker dealers and their activities in structured products, and in swaps, and in over-the-counter options and all of that, which that's also expanding significantly. We are becoming a large provider of basket trading - basket building indices for broker dealers and banks for them to then do their over-the-counter structured products. So it's a whole ecosystem that we're building. Andy, on the financials?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. So Craig, as we've talked about in the past and as Henry just underscored, continue to be very bullish about the opportunity for us longer term in both listed and over-the-counter derivatives. In the current quarter, there was some points to flag here. Importantly, the comp, it's a tough comp. So when you look at the first quarter of last year, that was a period of highest volatility and as a result, highest volume in derivative contracts traded. And so when you just do that comparison, there was a drop in year-over-year volumes and given that we price and get paid based on the contract volume that will impact the revenues that we receive. It is worth noting the run rate could pick up, which you probably noticed. That was as a result of some of the repricings of agreements with our exchange partners. It's worth noting, this is the last quarter where you will see that benefit. So that was baked in as of Q2 of last year. So going forward, you won't see that pricing benefit in our run rate and will be much more tied to the contract volumes. I would highlight that specifically, one area where you're seeing contract volumes pick up, but it's still behind is the transition from SGX to Hong Kong exchanges. We're seeing the franchise and complex Hong Kong exchanges start to build up. But relative to where the volumes were on SGX, it's a little bit lighter today. And so when you start to do historical comparisons, volumes will look a bit lower. But over the long term, we continue to be very bullish in this area, and that will translate not only through to the asset-based fee component, but also help to drive some of the index subscription revenue as well, which is where we see the over-the-counter piece.
Craig Huber: Then also, guys, if I could just ask you, institutional passive products direct into indexing, can you maybe size that for us as a percent of your revenues? How big of an opportunity you view that right now? And is the game plan in Europe, how is that evolving versus the U.S.?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. I mean non-ETF passive, as we call it, which it's really comprised of a few areas, what we call institutional passive. There's also index-based mutual funds, which are more retail-oriented, generally. And then increasingly, the areas like direct indexing, which will show up or could show up in that revenue stream. It's an area that's been strong growth and extremely resilient, which you can see by the growth rate, which we've seen actually double-digit growth in each of the last 6 quarters within the non-ETF passive line despite the market volatility. Relative to ETF, we actually see fewer redemptions and outflows and periods of volatility. And as we've mentioned in the past, the fees have been quite resilient in this area. We're seeing tremendous growth in nonmarket cap mandates and nonmarket cap non-ETF launches and products there, where the fees tend to be a little bit more resilient during certain areas, actually, we get higher fees. Just to dimension it for you, there's now about $2.7 trillion of assets under management in non-ETF index funds linked to our indexes. And just - you can tell by the run rate continues to be a strong growth area for us, and it's a big focus for us, an increasing focus for us. And we see enormous opportunities across all regions. And one of the big drivers here really is the transition to ESG and climate. And so we're seeing tremendous growth in the non-ETF AUM bucket in ESG and climate indexes. So overall area we're focused on and should continue to grow for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.
Owen Lau: So MSCI continues to gain traction in corporate. Henry, you mentioned some numbers on the prepared remarks. Could you please talk about what specific products driving the growth there and also the outlook?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So a lot of what we're doing there so far is selling the underlying data and ratings, which, as you know, are organized along industry lines, sector lines, to the corporate. So if you're a corporation, and you want to know what your rating is and you want to compare that rating and the underlying - sort of the underlying information in the reports to other participants in your sector, in your industry, and if you want to do cross sectoral comparisons, for example, then that's what you're getting. So that's the corporate themselves. Now we also, as I noted, sell the information and the ratings to the corporate advisers. That could be accounting firms, could be investment banks, could be a strategy consulting firms, et cetera, could be specialized advisers that are trying to help those entities figure out how to deal with all their ESG disclosures, their ESG data capabilities and increasingly, obviously, as time goes by, their net zero pledges that they need to make, et cetera. So this is a very fertile ground for us. As you know, just in ACWI IMI, there are 9,000 companies and therefore, calling on - or having 50 out of the 9,000 is a small, very small penetration. Now increasingly, we're also going to be - but we're not there yet, but we're also going to begin to help many of these corporate entities think through with respect to climate, what their data projections should be, what their position with respect to emissions should be with data, models, analytics, that was what Baer was referring to on that platform that we're building on top of Microsoft. So again, another area of fertile growth for us.
Owen Lau: That's very helpful. And then for the adjusted EBITDA expense guidance, Andy, you raised the guidance by around $15 million to $20 million. Could you please talk about how much of that was driven by top line growth and how much of that is driven by the reopening of the economy like higher T&E and maybe health care cost?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. Well, the two are related. It was definitely driven by the top line growth and most notably in acceleration in the ETF growth rate in AUM in ETFs linked to our index as well as accelerations in key parts of our business-like climate and ESG, as you can see by the tremendous success that we're having there. Just as a reminder, when we set our guidance at the beginning of the year, we said that was based on the assumption of relatively flat market levels. Clearly, markets have improved thus far this year, and we feel pretty bullish about the outlook for the balance of the year. And so those two inputs feed into our calculus in terms of how much we want to go to our upturn playbook. And so the increase in guidance is really reflecting the momentum we're seeing in our business, but also the more bullish outlook that we see in the economy and the markets and our clients, more broadly. And so we are turning to our upturn playbook to invest in the Triple-Crown areas we've talked about in the past and the areas that are driving our growth. So it's in areas like nonmarket cap weighted indexes, areas like climate and ESG as well as the data and technology that supports both of them in areas like research and go-to-market that are going to help continue to fuel these growth engines for the company. And so we're really, as we said and said we would do and as we've done in the past, accelerating our investments when we see the opportunity to do it. And we think this environment lends itself to it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equity.
Simon Clinch: I was wondering if I could follow-on from the opportunity on the corporate customer side. Just kind of curious as to how to think about how those customers are coming sort of entering this business with you in terms of size. So when you take on a new corporate customer, are they keep coming in? And is the ultimate opportunity for that individual customer to spend multiples of what they spend today? Is that very much present and the real opportunity for you as well as just growing the number of customers? And I have a follow-on to that as well.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So the - clearly, since we are - this is a new client segment for us. We're trying to start with a very direct and value-added and narrow set of offerings, which is the ESG ratings and all the information and the data that goes with the ratings of that particular corporate and the comparison of that ratings to others in their industry and across industries. And we have established a specialized sales force of a handful of people around the world to do that. And as we build momentum and more success, we're going to reinvest a lot of the incremental revenues into expanding the sales force and the client coverage of that. On top of that, there are significant opportunities to expand and have multiples, large multiples of the revenue that we're getting as we go into other products and services that we can provide those companies such as what I was talking about in climate, but we're not there yet. We're trying to make sure we go on a systematic approach to this one step at a time in a new area that we are covering but I would anticipate that there will be a fairly rapid expansion of our products out there, our sales force, and our run rate and our sales and our run rate and obviously, more to report on that in coming quarters.
Simon Clinch: That's great. And just to follow-on with that. I mean when you talk about the advisory entities that you're selling to as well and the distribution platforms, are you viewing those as effectively opportunities to expand much faster without given the limitations of your existing sales force? Or do you view them as completely new separate customer sets to those corporate customers, the direct corporate customers that you're targeting as well?
Baer Pettit: No, we clearly view those as separate, right? So I think when you refer to the advisory firms, that's in the wealth segment, overwhelmingly. So that's a discrete from the corporate segment. And it's really - we believe it's a pretty large opportunity for us. If that's what you meant by the...
Simon Clinch: So yes. I must have missed it. All right. Yes, that makes sense.
Henry Fernandez: Let me just clarify. Let me just clarify, if you don't mind. I think what you were referring to, which is the comment that I made is, there are advisers to companies such as the accounting firm, such as the investment banks, such as - and all of that, that are - their advisers to the CEO, to the CFO, the Treasurer and the Board of Directors of those companies and trying to understand the ESG, the landscape, their ratings, their disclosures, what data they need to provide, et cetera, et cetera. So what we view this corporate advisory entity is in 2 categories, is the category augmenting our sales force into the corporates. And secondly, for them to provide advice with the data and the tools to the companies that we're not in a position to be advising them as to what to do to enhance the ratings or enhance their disclosures and things like that. So that's the - we have different type of adviser networks like financial advisers and investment advisers and whatever in the corporate advisory segment, we're talking about the advisers to the companies and it's in both categories. We're augmenting what we're doing, using them as a channel and therefore, hopefully, relying on them to be providing advice to the companies as to what to do with the data and the ratings, right?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast.
Keith Housum: Andy, just trying to unpack the upturn playbook a little bit more and trying to understand the $15 million to $25 million additional expenses. As you think about the rest of the year, how does that compare to, I guess, what your original plan was in terms of, I guess, how should percentage grow? And then what is also taking consideration, I guess, a return to a more normalized work environment, if any?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. So it - just to dimension that, as I said before, and we've mentioned the original guidance was based on the assumption of relatively flat market levels. ETF AUM is up nearly 15% on the year. Non-ETF passive is up strongly, and we expect to continue to rally strongly. And so just those 2 line items alone are driving some pickup in our revenue above kind of that baseline assumption when we set the guidance back at the beginning of the year. And then we're seeing strong growth in areas like ESG and climate. And so when you look at the growth, the increase in expense guidance, the midpoint going up about $20 million, to your point, that's an increase in expense growth rate of 2.5%, which is relatively modest in the grand scheme of the impact on revenue that the pickup in ABF has for us. And so, we continue to be able to drive strong positive operating leverage but really continue to drive investment in these key growth engines for the firm and continue to accelerate these Triple-Crown opportunities. To your second question about the return to kind of a pre-COVID world, I would highlight in the first quarter, there was about a $3 million benefit from COVID-related expense benefits. Obviously, that starts to go away in future quarters where a year ago, we were getting those benefits as well. But we do have some assumption about a return to normalization, but it's not a full return. So just to give you some numbers to dimension that.
Keith Housum: Got you. And then coming back to that $20 million increase in the upturn playbook. As you look at your operating expenses, how much of your operating expenses are currently invested in future growth if it's the data centers or new solutions, new products?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. I broaden it to our - and we talked about this at Investor Day, to our investment portfolio or change the business expenses, which is about $150 million of expenditures and so that's against our total expense base plus CapEx. We define our expenditure pool. So of that total pool, call it about $150 million is in these kind of change the business Triple-Crown areas, and these are the areas that we're going to really be accelerating.
Henry Fernandez: What I would add also is that the expense growth in our business as usual, right, maintain the business is not very high, it's relatively muted. And therefore, our game plan in the context of continuing to have modest leverage - operating leverage expansion or margin expansion, right, is to increasingly squeeze the operating expenses of the - running the business in order to transfer more and more of investment of money into the investment plan so therefore, the investment numbers are growing clearly much more rapidly than the overall expenses in running the existing business. And all of you know this, but I'd just like to clarify one more time is that sometimes we talk about expenses. And I just want to be very pointed that the large majority of this incremental EBITDA expenses are investment in Triple-Crown investment types. And as you know, the Triple Crown is in areas of high growth like index and ESG and climate with high rates of return and fast paybacks and hopefully, in areas that have high multiples of valuation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sameer Kalucha with Deutsche Bank.
Sameer Kalucha: The thing I wanted to get some color on was the investment solutions as service initiative that you announced on the Analyst Day, you announced there were 4 services that were going to be launched in 2021. Just wondering if the launch was on track. That's one. And number two, would the pricing be any different when customers use your solutions as a service versus regular contracts that they have right now? Would there be any difference in pricing and margins?
Henry Fernandez: So to some extent, some of that is a relabeling of what we currently do. Investment solutions of service, data management as a service, data as a service. And in some cases, it's a new product and a new service. So for example, ESG data as a service is definitely a major expansion of what we're trying to do. During the lead up to Investor Day, as you know, we had a number of discussions with shareholders and analysts as to what they would like us to consider and work on. And the #1 category was for us to expose our ESG and climate data way beyond the ratings products and the screening products and the index products, right? So that would be an expansion. Another area of expansion is data management as a service to our - to many of our clients, including our analytics clients, in which data management in their internal workflow is one of the biggest pain points. We're very good at that. So we are expanding that capability to do that, not only as a support to selling of our products and services like analytics, risk and performance analytics, but also on a standalone basis. So that would be an expansion. So when you think about that totality, what is a relabeling. Obviously, the pricing will be about the same as before. And what is a new service, we will definitely be looking at a new pricing of that. All of this falls into the category of something that we had talked about before, which is what we call colloquially at MSCI, went in the kitchen, right? We have a great kitchen that creates great food, great experience. We want to expose that kitchen to people as well, right?
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Simpson with BNP Paribas.
Gregory Simpson: Is it possible to find out if you have any updates on the partnership with Burgiss? I think you've said you've got quite a few products and solutions you've been working on. So I'm wondering if you had any more color on the time line around any launches. As it seems the industry trend towards private market seems to really be intensifying right now.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So I think the same thing we've been focusing on is just working with Burgiss on running and optimizing their business day-to-day. We - there's a new President at Burgiss, as we've mentioned before, Jay McNamara, he used to be at MSCI. So a lot of our emphasis is just as working with them as a partner to grow the business every day, every week. Additionally, this quarter, we've been doing a lot of work on our private market strategy. And that has a variety of different avenues in it related to both working together on their data platform, working on plans for ESG and climate for private companies and our future path in areas such as real estate, which span across both assets that we have at MSCI and those in Burgiss. So there's a lot of work coming on there, and we'll likely have more products coming out during the second half of the year that come out of the work that we're doing at present.
Gregory Simpson: And then just quickly, on the firm-wide ESG and climate run rate, which, I think, is now $254 million. Is it [indiscernible] to have some color on how this splits by geography, if possible?
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. I'm going to - we'll have to follow-up on that question. I'm not going to provide the exact breakdown right now by the 2 components. As you would imagine, on the index side, there is a heavy component that is asset-based fee-related and a lot of that tends to be U.S.-listed products. And very attractively, a lot of that is - flows into U.S. exposure funds, which, as you know, is a place where we historically haven't had a strong presence, but it continues to be a driver of us capturing market share on flows into U.S. exposure products. Overall, I'd say the run rate is pretty well spread across geographies with a heavy emphasis on EMEA and Americas. But they're all growing at a nice clip. And as Baer mentioned in his prepared remarks, the EMEA run rate on the climate and research side has been growing at an incredible clip.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Just one question from me. Is there an opportunity for MSCI to develop crypto indices and other crypto solutions? And how might the massive energy consumption of the crypto economy impact your decision-making on that front?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So we have been studying that, deeply investigating all of that. And they are, as you know, well, at the top of the house, and the top of the thing is if there are 2 types of currencies. There is the Central Bank and digital currencies. And which China, obviously, is leading the pack there, and we're evaluating what impact of that would be on the pricing of financial assets, for example. And then there is the cryptocurrency, which is a little more like a gold type of investing. So we're definitely looking into that to see what impact - we haven't come up yet with the right products or the right indices. We're analyzing that importantly. And the second part, yes, cryptocurrencies have a role to play in climate change because of the energy consumption there. So that's another area that we're looking into is how do we combine the topic of cryptocurrency with the topic of climate change. So more to come on that in the future.
Operator: There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Henry Fernandez for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Well, thank you, everyone, for listening. As you can see, we have enormous opportunities in front of us. We are very relatively bullish on the operating environment. And therefore, we'll step up our pace of investing and continue to do that at the same time as having some modest margin expansion. So thank you very much, and we look forward to your question, your comments also to Salli and the team.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin. 
Sallilyn Schwartz: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter 2020. This press release along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com, under the Investor Relations tab. 
 Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. 
 During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in the appendix of the earnings presentation. 
 We will also discuss run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We, therefore, caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. Additionally, we will discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. 
 On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO, Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] 
 With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry? 
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. MSCI continues to deliver on its mission of helping investors build better portfolios for a better world. Our ultimate goal is to provide an index for every portfolio and tools for every investment decision worldwide. 
 Especially in 2020, we continue to deliver mission-critical tools to enable clients to navigate uncertainty and respond to industry transformations resulting from the unprecedented environment. Our relentless focus on execution, our disciplined approach to investments and our strategic capital allocation underpin our ability to deliver value to our shareholders. 
 MSCI's financial performance in the fourth quarter strongly validates this approach. We achieved total revenue growth of over 9% and total subscription run rate growth of nearly 11%, adjusted EBITDA growth of over 16% and adjusted EPS growth of over 17%. In 2020, we achieved free cash flow of $760 million, up 16% from 2019. We feel this was outstanding financial performance in the context of a very tumultuous year in so many fronts. 
 Our success and our momentum has been driven by us being able to identify and capitalize on major transformations taking place in the investment industry and our ability to support our clients with critical insights, thought leadership and actionable solutions. 
 I will provide a few selected comments along the dimensions of clients, products and capabilities, and Baer and Andy will then give you some more details. In the client category, we have been successful in expanding our footprint with both new and existing clients. In our strategic focus on wealth management, we are capitalizing on the focus of financial advisers on direct indexing, portfolio construction, risk and performance management and ESG and climate. We're also seeing early traction with corporate clients, and we now have over 80 corporate clients for our ESG and climate offerings. 
 We continue to expand our business with our established base of asset managers and asset owners. In 2020, our asset management clients launched more than 150 new ETFs linked to MSCI Indices, over half of which were linked to MSCI ESG and climate indices. Regionally, our integrated client approach has led to high levels of engagement and activity. In Europe, regulatory requirements for our clients helped drive record quarterly recurring subscription sales during the fourth quarter. In Asia, new subscription sales in the fourth quarter improved 62% sequentially after a very slow process during the year, given the early pandemic disruptions in the region. 
 In the category of products and services, our product innovation is driven by our relentless focus on the needs of investors. One area of significant investor focus is the global transition to a low-carbon economy and its impact on portfolios. Our Climate Value-at-Risk products have seen excellent traction and are already helping investors measure and manage climate risk as well as identifying investment opportunities. 
 Fixed income is another area where we continue to enrich our offerings. We are leveraging our strong brand in ESG, climate factors and risk and performance analytics to benefit our credit investor clients. 
 Lastly, we continue to build critical capabilities, especially in technology and data. This includes accelerating the transition of our suite of products to the cloud through our partnership with Microsoft. We're also excited about enabling clients further with more seamless access to MSCI data across all product lines. You will be hearing more about this in future quarters, especially in ESG and climate. 
 Another key ingredient of our strategy is allocating capital in a systematic and disciplined manner. This approach has been highly effective for us, including in a year like 2020. We activated our downturn playbook in the second quarter as the pandemic took hold and market volatility and economic uncertainty rose dramatically. Then in the third quarter, we transitioned efficiently to our upturn playbook as our business remained resilient, our financials were protected and we saw expansion opportunities. 
 It is also important to note that in 2020, our adaptable and entrepreneurial culture played a critical role in our success, especially given the major disruptions in our working environment and that of our clients. Following closely on the incredible momentum we have built in 2020, MSCI has never been better positioned to take advantage of accelerating secular and disruptive investment trends, which will allow us to deliver sustained and significant top line growth. We remain deeply committed to investing responsibly in Triple-Crown opportunities to leverage and build on the established scale of our business. Our intention is to continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We're especially energized to talk further with you about our plans at our upcoming Investor Day on February 24. 
 Before I turn the call over to Baer and Andy, I am pleased to announce that we will be reporting ESG and climate as a stand-alone reporting segment starting in the first quarter of this year. Our All Other segment will consist of our private assets, the private asset product line, including our Real Estate business. This incremental transparency will enhance awareness and understanding of these important growth areas for our company. You will have more insight into the drivers of segment growth, the actions that we are taking and the investments that we're making. 
 Finally, we believe it's critical that we meaningfully integrate corporate responsibility principles into our own strategy and operations. We continue to enhance our processes and disclosures, including, most recently, publishing our 2020 TCFD report and FASB aligned disclosures on data security, workforce diversity and engagement and professional integrity. I look forward to providing you with further updates as we continue to make progress in these very important areas. 
 With that I'll now turn over the call over to Baer. 
C. Pettit: Thank you, Henry, and greetings, everyone. I'll echo Henry's enthusiasm for the progress we've made this past year. We had our best-ever quarter for subscription sales across MSCI and in our Index and ESG segments individually. 
 Assets in equity ETFs linked to MSCI Indexes passed the $1 trillion mark for the first time in our history. As of last Thursday, these assets reached further all-time highs, above $1.16 trillion. AUM and equity ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and climate indexes were at $106 billion at year-end, tripling year-over-year. And 7 of the 10 largest equity ESG ETFs globally are benchmarked to MSCI Indexes. We're pleased with these accomplishments and excited for the momentum we see in our business. 
 I want to expand on some aspects of our strategy, starting with clients and client segments. Our key accounts, which represent nearly 2/3 of our run rate, drove 50% of new subscription sales this quarter. While in 2020, MSCI also gained more than 450 new clients. In ESG, new clients represented over 50% of new subscription sales this year. Henry noted our efforts with wealth management firms. We are pleased both with the progress of our sales in this segment and our early steps in new opportunities like direct indexing. Wealth management was the fastest-growing client segment for Analytics in 2020 with run rate up 11%, while index run rate grew at 20% and ESG research at over 70%. Our total run rate with wealth managers is now more than $60 million, up 23% from 2019. For corporates, we recently launched an interactive industry ESG materiality map on msci.com. 
 This tool helps corporates better understand how various ESG risk exposures factor into their ESG ratings. More broadly, issuers and corporate advisory firms are leveraging our ESG ratings universe for use cases ranging from benchmarking to climate modeling. 
 From a regional perspective, in EMEA, our 2020 subscription run rate growth was 15% as strong recurring sales offset cancels. In Asia and the Americas, we had 9% and 7% subscription run rate growth, respectively. A solid result for the year, especially acknowledging the challenges some of our clients face during the pandemic. We are now seeing our pipeline build as we would expect at this time of year. It remains healthy across products and regions and above pipeline levels at this time last year. 
 As I've emphasized before, I've been eager to make innovation in our products and services central to what we do at MSCI. In October, we launched 8 MSCI Climate Paris Aligned Indexes. These indexes are designed to help investors incorporate climate change into their portfolios. They also help investors align their investment strategies with the 1.5 degree warming scenario targeted by the Paris Agreement. 
 Henry mentioned the success we are seeing with our Climate Value-at-Risk products. We recently integrated Climate Value-at-Risk into Analytics products to support clients with their regulatory requirements, such as TCFD reporting. We also integrated Analytics portfolio optimization tools into our Climate Value-at-Risk products. Thus, climate analysis feeds our Analytics products and vice versa. Further in Analytics, during the fourth quarter, we launched Multi-Period Stress Testing capabilities. 
 We're acutely aware that investors look at their positions through a lens of different time horizons, and we want to provide them with industry-leading tools to do so. We believe MSCI is truly differentiated in this regard as these capabilities leverage MSCI's market-leading multi-asset class factor models and stress testing tools. 
 As you're aware, fixed income is another area of focus for MSCI. I'm pleased to note that we closed our first fixed income index subscription deal during the past quarter. This is an important milestone and a validation of our belief that this nascent product line has significant potential. We are also mapping our ESG ratings to bank loans, expanding our ESG ratings coverage of fixed income securities and enhancing fixed income factor content for our risk and performance analytics. Our footprint in fixed income continues to grow with run rate in this area up 10% in 2020. 
 Henry mentioned our focus on enhancing our data capabilities. Leveraging our partnership with Microsoft, we have made a great deal of progress with our API strategy in the fourth quarter. As one example, we are building accessibility to our ESG ratings and other ESG underlying data through APIs as well as through other state-of-the-art content delivery platforms. 
 We must continue to support our clients' ever-evolving needs, lean into our own tremendous opportunities and drive sustained high levels of growth. MSCI will invest in several key areas in 2021. First, we will continue developing new innovative indexes and other tools that enable our clients to build portfolios that meet their investment objectives. Second, we will keep expanding the coverage of our ESG and climate ratings and capabilities, including the data initiatives I mentioned previously. And third, we will invest in our broader technology transformation and client-driven migration to a service platform. These investments will be executed within our rigorous Triple-Crown capital allocation framework. We intend to continue generating strong free cash flow. As Henry noted, we look forward to highlighting our opportunities, our investments and the value creation we believe will result at our upcoming Investor Day event. 
 Let me now turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss more specifics of the financial aspects of our performance. Over to you, Andy. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Thanks, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call this morning. As Henry and Baer noted, we finished 2020 with a strong fourth quarter and significant momentum heading into 2021. 
 In Index, we recorded double-digit subscription run rate growth for the 28th consecutive quarter. Market cap weighted modules, which represent the largest part of our index subscription run rate, continued to deliver strong growth of approximately 9% in the quarter; while our factor, ESG, custom and specialized modules grew at healthy double-digit growth rates. 
 From a client segment perspective, the index subscription run rate growth with asset managers, the largest client segment, was 9%; while growth rates among wealth managers, hedge funds and asset owners were all greater than 15%. Assets under management and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes reached record levels, driven by strong cash inflows of $59 billion or close to 30% of all cash inflows into equity ETFs during the quarter. This was driven by strong market share capture of cash inflows across all geographic regions and particular strength in emerging market exposures. 
 Equity ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and climate indexes experienced cash inflows of nearly $25 billion during the quarter. These cash inflows represented nearly 80% of all inflows into ESG and climate ETFS. Overall, asset-based fee revenue was up over 15% year-on-year, reflecting higher results across the board, including from ETFs, non-ETF passive products and futures and options. 
 Turning now to our adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year. Underlying business performance drove the vast majority of our growth in adjusted EPS, while our share repurchases also contributed. Operating revenue growth was strong, and year-over-year expenses were up modestly, once again, benefiting from lower travel and entertainment expenses, which were lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 by $4.2 million and somewhat offset by our reaccelerated pace of investments in the second half of 2020. 
 Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to have strong liquidity that provides us tremendous flexibility. We finished the quarter with total debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.5x, at the top end of our targeted range of 3 to 3.5x. Lower cash tax payments and disciplined client collections led to significant outperformance in our free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter relative to our guidance. 
 As Henry noted earlier, we have been pleased with the success of our capital management strategy, and we'll continue our disciplined and patient approach to allocating capital. We are keenly focused on reinvesting in the business as a first priority, optimizing our leverage profile to enhance returns and maintain flexibility, providing a consistent quarterly dividend that grows with earnings and is based on a payout ratio of 40% to 50% of adjusted EPS, opportunistically pursuing MP&A and share repurchases with an intense focus on maximizing returns to shareholders and preserving a strong liquidity position. 
 As Henry noted, to enhance shareholder awareness and understanding of our progress in pursuing key growth opportunities in ESG and climate and in private assets, starting this year, we will present ESG and climate as its own reporting segments and All Other will consist of operating segments and private assets. Beginning in April, when we report Q1 earnings, you will see the same financial and operating metrics we currently show for the Index and Analytics segments also for the ESG and Climate segment and for Real Estate. So that you have historical information for comparative purposes, we will provide information for the new reporting segment annually for 2018 and 2019 and quarterly for 2020. Revenue and operating metrics from ESG and Climate indexes will remain within our Index segment. We are excited to bring this incremental transparency to our disclosures and to continue to update you on these exciting areas of growth and opportunity. 
 Before I turn to guidance, I would like to highlight that recurring subscription revenue has lagged subscription run rate by a slightly larger amount in the last couple of quarters. As noted in our disclosures, there are several factors that can contribute to this, including, but not limited to, the timing of sales and cancels; modifications; FX movements; delayed contract start dates, also known as advanced bookings; and implementation periods. 
 In response to the COVID pandemic, we have selectively used advanced bookings recently to help drive new business in key areas. When these are offered, the client is contractually committed to a subscription agreement, but may have access to the service prior to the beginning of the fee period at no cost. In these cases, the sale may be recognized before we begin recognizing revenue or we may recognize a lower amount of revenue in the first year relative to the size of the sale. We used these tools selectively this past year. And while we do intend to continue to use them going forward, we don't expect the magnitude to increase materially. However, as we said at the top of the call, we would caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenues. 
 Turning to our guidance. Our expectations for 2021 reflect what we believe will be another strong year for MSCI with several guiding principles. Our expense guidance assumes relatively flat equity market levels for the year. As such, our expenses may flex up and down depending on market conditions and the trajectory of our asset-based fees. To that end, we will continue to implement our upturn and downturn playbooks if and when they are needed. As we've noted throughout this call, investing in our business remains our top priority. However, we are also committed to delivering positive operating leverage, although you should expect to see more modest margin expansion than in recent past. 
 Our free cash flow guidance reflects strong operating performance and strong collections; relatively flat market levels, although we could, of course, see markets perform better or worse; margin expansion over the course of the year, again, likely at a more modest pace than in recent past; and higher cash taxes in 2021. 
 In summary, 2020 was a very strong year for MSCI despite the global hardship related to the pandemic. We have continued to deliver innovative indexes, research, data and other tools. We've executed against our strategic priorities, staying incredibly productive and engaged as a team. And as always, we remain committed to driving further value for our shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you in a few weeks at Investor Day. 
 And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: So looking at the expense guidance, you're targeting about a 9% increase in expenses for the year, which is a relatively normal percentage for you, but it's off of a year where you didn't increase expenses at all versus the prior. And so just running through the model, I'm getting that maybe you could expand EBITDA margins by about 100 basis points off of a year where margins were abnormally high because of COVID savings, like lower travel, et cetera. So my question is, why not invest more in the business to support the growth? Is this caution because maybe we're not through with COVID yet? Or do you view this COVID savings items as sustainable? And then maybe just as we look through the year, should we expect more of a margin increase at the beginning versus the back half where maybe some of the COVID items come -- return? 
Henry Fernandez: That's a great question, Toni. And it cuts to the heart of what we're trying to do at MSCI, and that is to navigate a pretty tight rope between maintaining and enhancing our -- even though modestly, our margin levels, and at the same time, heavily investing in the critical growth areas that our clients are crying for new tools, such as, obviously, climate change now, which is increasing dramatically; obviously, overall ESG; the demand for indices with an investment thesis around them, it's off the charts; clearly, understanding the risk of people's portfolio, especially factor risks, such as the transition from value to growth or cyclical to growth investing; and of course, the private asset classes. So we are entering a period at MSCI of major, major demand from our existing clients and the newer client segments that we're penetrating, such as wealth, corporates, insurance companies for a lot more tools coming from MSCI. 
 So let me turn it over to Andy to see if he can give you -- give us a little more insight into how the -- all of that plays into the dynamics of the growth of the EBITDA expense line. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. Thanks, Henry. And good question, Toni. Maybe if I can provide a little bit more color from a financial standpoint and underscore some of the points that you've made and Henry made. We are coming off a year, as you said, where expenses were lower than we anticipated. They were brought down by COVID-related impacts like T&E being lower. We also very actively went to the downturn playbook in the middle of the year, and the ABF rebounded faster than we were able to begin reinvesting in the business when we went back to the upturn playbook. So that did depress the expense base in 2020. 
 To your point, if you look back to 2019 and extrapolate through to what our guidance is for 2021, you'll see there's a more normalized trajectory across the 2 years. Looking forward and taking into consideration a couple of factors that set into our guidance, firstly, there will be some rebound in T&E and COVID-related costs, but we don't anticipate it will be a full normalization. So there will be some continued benefit going forward. And obviously, that can change and adjust depending on how the pandemic unfolds here and we return to the pace with which we return to a normalized working environment. 
 The other thing that is important to remember here is, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our guidance assumes markets remain relatively flat. And so we've put an expense guidance range here that assumes relatively flat market levels. If market levels do rebound significantly and show a sustained improvement or the markets increase significantly and show a sustained improvement, we will go to our upturn playbook likely and expenses could be higher. Similarly, we could see, if the markets pull back significantly for a sustained amount, we could be lower than the expense guidance. And so it could go either way. One of the things we wanted to do with the guidance this year was show you what the guidance is based on current market levels so -- to give you the heads up that it could change if they swing one way or the other. 
 The other point of note, I would say, factors in here is there is some implicit FX pressure embedded in the expense growth as well, where the U.S. dollar has depreciated relative to most foreign currencies relative to average rates for 2020. And so that puts some pressure on the expense growth as well, and that's something we're keeping a close eye on. But I think overall, to Henry's point, we are extremely focused on continuing to invest in key initiatives and key investments that are going to continue to extend the duration and improve the trajectory of our growth profile going forward. And so that will be a top priority, and we will continue to calibrate it throughout the year. 
Henry Fernandez: Given the importance of -- Toni, given the importance of this question, let me just add one more comment here. And that is we have, in the recent past, began to look at EBITDA expenses in 2 major categories. Expenses that are required to continue to run the business, and EBITDA expenses that are really investment, significant investment into areas of growth. And given that -- given the nature of our company as an IT company, the vast majority of our investment gets expensed immediately upon execution and the revenues come in a year or 2 or 3 years later. 
 So what we have done, and continue to do in this space, is basically strangle as much as we can and squeeze as much as we can the EBITDA expenses of running the business to free up more and more capital for investments that go into changing the business. In kind of big -- sort of rough numbers, over time, we'll give you a more precise analysis of this. Our change to business expenses, which are really investments in the operating expenses of the company, i.e., the EBITDA expenses of the company, are somewhere in the low to mid-teens percentage of the total EBITDA expenses. We're trying to move that to the mid- to high teens in 2021 and beyond. Hopefully, someday in the next 2 to 3 years, those can be in the 20s. So that a meaningful percentage of what people think of expenses are really investing. You have seen the acceleration of growth in many aspects of our business, especially ESG, futures and options and fixed income and all of that, which are beneficiaries of this investment that we have made 1 or 2, 3 years prior to getting the acceleration of growth. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Henry, let me just add one last point to make sure everyone's aware of, and I know most of you incorporate this into your models. But given the swings we saw both on the top line and the expense line in 2020 throughout the year, the expense growth and margin could fluctuate quarter to quarter throughout 2021, just given the relative comparisons year-over-year. 
Toni Kaplan: That's great. I wanted to also ask how important to you is or was the IHS partnership that you had? Is your expectation that they will not be working with you in the future because they've announced the combination with S&P? I know you were working with them on fixed income liquidity risk solutions and thinkFolio but maybe there were other areas, too. So can you outline what opportunities you were working on with them? And if those can be replicated by partnering with another provider like Bloomberg, for example? 
Henry Fernandez: That's another great question. We have a very focused and strong strategy at MSCI of working in partnerships with others in the industry. And whether it's client partnerships, obviously, that will be the highest impact to people who have different kinds of data or different kinds of technology or different distribution systems. We believe strongly at MSCI in an open architecture system for the benefit of clients. So the area that you will see us working extremely hard in building partnerships across the whole spectrum. And when you think about our M&A, sort of think the vast majority of our time and effort in M&A is what we call MP&A: mergers, partnerships and acquisitions. 
 So IHS Markit has been one of those key relationships that we have built. In the context of the merger between S&P Global and IHS Markit, I have had discussions with the CEOs of both companies in which they intend to preserve and enhance the nature of this partnership for us to join -- to have products together and for the clients. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. 
Manav Patnaik: Maybe kind of a follow-up to that. But Henry, I was just wondering the way the markets have been pretty much just going up despite COVID. There's also been a lot of M&A around your areas of focus, ESG, data, generally speaking. How is that influencing or changing the way you look at your build versus buy decisions or even just your MP&A framework? 
Henry Fernandez: Good question, Manav. I think the strategy continues the same. And we are in the highly enviable position at MSCI that our organic investment opportunities are vast and they yield incredible returns. And the reason is that they have built at the margin on top of an existing infrastructure. We could see that in Estate and Index, and we're beginning to see it in ESG. And obviously, in Analytics, we're still building some capabilities, so the returns are lower than Index and ESG, but it's still in the high double digit, the internal rates of return. 
 So therefore, we -- and we are stretched for investment given the objectives that we have on the margin of the company. So therefore, we're very focused on organic investment. We do not really need any significant acquisition at this point to get us to where we want to be in the company. That doesn't mean we don't look at everything and analyze everything. We are trying to step up our activities in small bolt-on acquisitions in data and tools and technology and the like, particularly in areas like fixed income and, of course, private asset classes, et cetera. But those will be more smaller and bolt-on and therefore, we continue to have major focus on organic investment. 
 The other thing that we like about that is because we want to do the opposite of what others are trying to do. We want to stay extremely focused on our strategy with a very empowered and entrepreneurial culture in which people can innovate, we can have better client interaction, better client services and all of that. And therefore, we don't want to become a sort of financial data conglomerate or financial investment tool conglomerate, made up of a lot of divisions and those divisions being run by administrators. We want to do the opposite. We want to have a highly integrated company run by entrepreneurs with high levels of innovation and high levels of investment and obviously, preservation of an enhancement of margin. We think that's a winning strategy for us. 
Manav Patnaik: Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate that. And just in terms of the upcoming IRD, I mean you talked about disclosures and so forth. You guys have always given quite a bit of color. I was just curious, like what should we be -- what are the main, I guess, agenda points on the upcoming IR day that we should be looking forward to? 
Henry Fernandez: Well, not to steal any thunder from the 24th, so we can get everyone to show up, right? I think what you're going to see from us is a continued focus on the mission of the company, the strategy, the demand that we see from all the client segments and the needs from clients, therefore, the organic investment plan that is attributed to that, the integrated franchise between the different product lines and all of that. And I think the area that you will see even more change in this Investor Day is our incredible push into technology and data. 
 In the past, we at MSCI have always thought of the investment tools first and technology and data enabling the investment tools. We want to start thinking the reverse. What can technology and data open up for us to create even more investment tools for the world? So there will be a segment on that as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. 
Alex Kramm: This maybe too detailed on the Analytics side. But I remember a few years ago, when you were still breaking out portfolio management and risk, there was a time that portfolio management was very weak and you cited quant funds as an area of weakness. There's been a lot of stories recently again how poor performance in quant has been in 2020, and this environment clearly doesn't work for them. So just curious, is a quant fund still a very big area for you guys? Maybe you can give us some updated numbers. And are you seeing weakness in that client segment? 
C. Pettit: Yes. Alex. I don't have the numbers -- sorry, there seems to be an echo on my line. Sorry, can you hear me? 
Alex Kramm: Much better now. 
C. Pettit: Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. So I don't have the numbers in front of me. But directionally, I would say that when you look at the equity analytics and the rest of the enterprise risk aspects of the business, there's no very explicit patterns that have been very stable over time. So the latest characteristic, I would say, is clearly in factors, we have grown very strongly in terms of their contribution to the Index business. The quant funds generally on the larger end of the scale, we're doing very well with. That's a limited number of very large players. And -- but I would then say that the smaller hedge funds, which are mixed range of strategies, continue to be a challenge for analytics. 
 So -- but if you look even further forward, I would say that this definition of the simple split between quants and non-quants is something which we think has changed over the years. And what we're seeing, particularly with kind of the next generation of clients is precisely the integration of quant tools or quant overlays into a lot of traditional portfolio management. But I don't know, Andy, if you have any specific numbers on that in front of us. We can always follow-up with you, Alex. But I think the long story short is there's definitely not a sort of a negative pattern here. We're not seeing quants as being anything unusually an outlier type of number. And on the more sophisticated quants, we're doing well. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. No, I'd underscore that, Baer. I think from a retention standpoint, hedge funds are below average, and it's largely attributable to the smaller hedge funds. And as Baer said, we do have success selling and growing within a lot of the larger hedge funds across products that we offer. I'd say the one other segment, just to provide a little bit more color on retention and analytics, that we felt pressure in 2020 was around banks. And so we did have some, particularly one large cancel among a bank, which depressed the retention rate across Analytics. 
Alex Kramm: Okay. Great. And then quickly, other topic. China is something that we keep on hearing about. And obviously, with some of the restrictions, there's been a lot of news around your index inclusions, et cetera, which is -- I know this is normal course of business for you. But my more important part of this question is, how does this kind of impact your China strategy in general? I mean that region is obviously growing rapidly and opening up for financial market participants. So I think you definitely have your eye on that region. So does that noise create headwinds right now in being able to grow with potential clients in the region? And maybe you can remind us how big China is as well. 
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So we are neutral to any of these geopolitical issues that take place in the world. Our main focus is always to serve the needs of global investors to invest in all regions of the world, including, obviously, emerging markets, which are higher risk than other regions. We tried to, therefore, stay away from all the politics and all the theatrics that take place there. 
 Secondly, we continue to believe that China, as the current second largest economy in the world and the opening up of its financial markets, is going to present vast opportunities for investors in the public market and the private market. Obviously, equity investment is opening up dramatically. Bond investing, given the high yields here and the appreciation of renminbi, will continue to be a major attraction for bond investors, especially sovereign bond investors and the like. We are very focused on continuing to expand our business in China to grow our cross-border business, so to speak, between global investors going into China, our business of helping Chinese institutions invest outside of China and in the domestic markets of China as well. And in this case, China, including obviously, Hong Kong. 
 So our business is still small in the sort of $15 million to $20 million range, something like that, in terms of run rate coming directly from China. Obviously, there is global investors who are focused on investing in China through our indices and our risk models. But we think that the opportunity is enormous, and we are very focused on building a strategy and expanding our footprint there, especially this year, in order to continue to capitalize on that significant opportunity and obviously continue to stay away from the geopolitics. And we'll have to comply with executive orders or legislation or whatever that comes our way, and that creates a lot of work for us. But overall, the big picture is nobody can really, at this point, negate the huge importance that China has and will have in portfolios around the world. 
Alex Kramm: Very helpful. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Just to provide a little bit more product color around it. We are -- our largest product traction in China is around analytics, where we have had quite a bit of traction and continue to grow. And as Henry said, as we build out our fixed income front office capability, a range of security coverage as well as analytic capabilities around private assets. We're bullish about the continued opportunity on the analytics. But we're extremely excited, I think, given our small base and the enormous opportunity in some of the other products like ESG, where we're starting to get some real traction as well as on the index side for the reasons Henry highlighted. So we very much view many layers of growth on the China front. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. 
Kwun Sum Lau: I think last quarter, MSCI launched -- correct me if I'm wrong on these numbers, launched 22 proprietary fixed income indices and the total was 40. I think this quarter, I think Baer mentioned that the run rate was about 10% in 2020. So it looks to me the pace that has been quite strong in this area. Could you please talk about the pipeline in the fixed income products? Are you still in the investing mode to introduce more products? Or do you think you have most of the products you like and are focused more on the sales and distribution so that investors can feel in the runway pretty soon? 
Henry Fernandez: I see. Yes. So the -- I think what I can tell you on fixed income indices is that our monetization of fixed income indices is made up of our own indices and the partnerships that we have with others. So therefore, a big part of our success thus far has been in ESG and climate change fixed income indices in partnership with Bloomberg and Barclays. And that has had a significant run rate. A lot of assets have gone into those ETF and a significant amount of run rate associated with that. We are building partnerships with others as well that are -- that have fixed income indices for us to support them with the content of ESG and climate and factors and the like. In addition to that, we obviously have started building our proprietary -- our own proprietary fixed income indices in areas that we believe that have high potential as well. And that's why you see us launching, and that's what the first 
 [Audio Gap] 
 the run rate on our own proprietary fixed income is still very, very small because we're just getting going on this and the like. 
 In terms of the product span, we, for sure, have ambitions to create a very large number of products, MSCI label fixed income indices in a lot of different varieties. We will try to avoid being in the issuance weighted type of indices, the market cap weighted type of indices and focus enormously on the things in which we have proprietary and value-add content. So factors such as ESG, such as climate and thematic investment fees. 
Kwun Sum Lau: Got it. That's very helpful. 
Andrew Wiechmann: I would highlight, we do have a very healthy pipeline of new opportunities, Owen. So I think you'll continue to see, hopefully, new ETFs and other passive products launched on our indexes. And we've got a healthy pipeline also of subscription-type deals on the fixed income index side. So it's very early days this year. As you know, we just launched our indexes about a year ago, but we continue to see pretty healthy demand. 
Kwun Sum Lau: Got it. That's very helpful. And then my next question is, I understand that most of the demand of your ESG products come from like investors, like asset managers and asset owners. I think, Henry, you mentioned that your traction on corporates, it's quite strong. I think you have 80 clients right now, if I remember correctly. Do you think the recent Nasdaq Board Diversity and Disclosure Proposal can further accelerate the demand of your ESG products from corporates in the United States? Can you talk about your recent conversation with them in terms of subscribing into more MSCI ESG offerings, maybe both within U.S. and outside U.S.? 
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So I think there are potentially 2 different things there, if I understood the question correctly. On one hand, what you have is a whole range of fixed income product offering from indices to fixed income risk models to fixed income analytics, liquidity and all of that, that are geared initially towards the asset managers that focus on fixed income and some asset owners. The plan there is to expand that offering to insurance companies, which obviously, as you know well, are very heavy investors in fixed income products around the world. So that is our entry into that client segment that traditionally has been more difficult for us because we haven't had a very expansive fixed income product line. So we're very hopeful that we can expand significantly into life and property and casualty insurance for their own account with respect to fixed income indices and analytics. And that will have also an overlay of value add in terms of ESG, in terms of climate and in terms of factors because -- and in terms of themes because that's where we can differentiate ourselves 
 [Audio Gap] 
 climate change. That's very separate, right? And the strategy there is that as climate change, particularly and ESG in general is getting more and more focus and attention on behalf of investors, a lot of corporate clients have come to us and say, how can you help us? How can we understand the kind of disclosures that are required for the ratings to understand where we stack up relative to the rest of the industry? What kind of data should we be producing? How do we transmit that data to investors? And all of that. So what we're doing, therefore -- the initial cut of this thing is to make sure that we sell the industry -- the ratings and the industry data to corporates, and therefore, we have established a corporate sales force to do that. We're working with partners to figure out if there is a mechanism by which we can create a technology platform for a lot of this data to be easily transmitted between investors and the providers of capital and the users of capital and all that. 
 So we see significant potential of expanding into the corporate suite, the issuer suite. And when we say corporate, it's just not only corporations, it's also other issuers of fixed income instruments. For example, we see a significant way to expand in that client segment, starting with a lot of their demands for ESG understanding, climate change understanding, the data that they need to produce, the way that they need to look at their ratings and so on and so forth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair. 
Christopher Shutler: Henry, we've recently seen a couple of big direct indexing or custom indexing-related acquisitions across the space. I know there are some puts and takes for MSCI as that phenomenon grows. But just curious the degree to which you're having conversations with brokers, asset managers and technology providers to license your indexes. And just how you're thinking about that phenomenon more broadly? Do you think the hype is justified? 
C. Pettit: Yes. It's Baer here. I might take this one. So look, we think that this is a category with a lot of opportunity for us. You -- referencing the BlackRock acquisition 
 [Audio Gap] 
 using our tools across the board, and we have a very strong relationship with them. We had, I would say, a very attractive sale recently in the wealth segment driven entirely by direct indexing as well as a few of them in some other segments. So we think that the component parts there, which are basically indexes, high-quality portfolio analytics tools and clearly an overlay of various methodological things related to tax, et cetera, are well suited to us. And that's, I would say, our house view at this moment. I'm fairly confident that during the course of 2021, we'll be able to bring you new examples of what we're doing there, which will kind of give you more color on the nature of that opportunity, but we feel it really plays to a lot of MSCI's core strengths. And at present, we're viewing it as nothing but opportunity. 
Christopher Shutler: Okay. And then just one other one on ESG, strong momentum there. Curious if you could just talk a little more specifically about the wealth channel opportunity. I know there's a good amount of skepticism around kind of ESG with financial advisers. So I'm guessing the opportunity is more to sell your ESG solutions into -- with the home offices maybe the custodians. So maybe just a little more color about how you're going to market there and with what solutions. 
C. Pettit: Sure. So actually, we found that ESG and climate as well, and we distinguish them now, as you know, on this call, have been really an accelerant of our dialogue with wealth organizations. Now there may be, to a degree, something to your point about the distinction between the home office and the adviser. And I think that that's particularly true in perhaps in the United States, but I don't think that that's true, for example, in wealth organizations across EMEA or even now in a nascent way in Asia, where I think the advisers also view this as an opportunity. And we see that already changing, I would say, the -- what we get from feedback, both through intermediaries and ourselves, from the advisers, even compared to a year ago, their view is changing. So I think we're really excited by this opportunity. It's also giving us dialogues not merely on ES&G and climate, but on some of our other product lines. So overall, I think really -- a really attractive opportunity for us with wealth and a door opener in many ways. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. 
Craig Huber: Henry, maybe if you could just touch on a little bit further your growth aspirations in the futures and options area and how that may differ in the U.S. versus overseas. 
Henry Fernandez: Vast opportunity for us. You probably remember 3 or 4 years ago, me talking about we're making $5 million on futures and options revenues. It will be $50 million in no time and $100 million, $200 million in the next 5, 7 years or so. Well, I was wrong. It -- we are at a pace right now of even higher revenues that I thought it will happen in the time frame. So I think the opportunity is significant. In many, many respects, it's -- as I've said before, the futures and options -- the listed futures and options industry has typically been a national market made up of single currency, single country exposures. And 1 or 2 exceptions, such as the EURO STOXX 50, it's a multi country, but it's still single currency exposure. 
 So the area where MSCI plays is in the multi-country, multi-currency exposure. And I think our exchange partners have cracked the code of how to create that and be traded in a time zone. So we started in the U.S., then we moved the work to Europe, and now obviously, we're spending a lot of time in Asia with the Hong Kong exchanges. So I view this on a 5-, 10-year horizon multiples of the run rate that we have today. And obviously, most of this is pure profit because it's all a byproduct of existing indices. And it will move from market cap indices alone to then ESG indices, climate change indices, thematic indices. At some point, we'll be experimenting with fixed income index exposure as well. So significant opportunity for us. 
Craig Huber: That's great, Henry. 
Andrew Wiechmann: And Craig, this is Andy. Craig, one thing just to highlight, just to keep in mind for the near-term expectations. The run rate over the last 6 quarters or so has really benefited from the repricing of agreements with many of our exchange partners. I would say those are largely complete, and we would expect the run rate growth to be more closely correlated with contract volumes going forward. 
Craig Huber: I appreciate that. But the other question I want to ask you, Henry or someone. Active versus passive, what percent of the U.S. equity market, Henry, do you think is passive now in the data you study? What is that number also in Europe? And maybe also just touch upon Japan, which I understand is much higher. 
Henry Fernandez: Yes. Look, there's always a lot of debate and discussion about this. And part of the debate is at what point is it going to reach saturation? And at what point is it going to tilt the balance? And at what point passive will create havoc? And all of that. We don't believe in any of that, and therefore, we have not spent that much of our time focusing on measuring how much is active, how much is passive and all of that. What I can tell you is that as it relates to our indices, there is about $3.5 trillion worth of money passively tracking our MSCI Indices. About $2.5 trillion of that is what we call institutional passive, meaning nonexchange traded, which is mostly institutional, some retail; and the other $1 trillion plus is obviously the ETF that we report. And that number keeps growing by leaps and bounds, and therefore, we believe that we're continuing to play on that theme. 
C. Pettit: Yes. I might just add one comment. Clearly, the category has become significantly redefined compared to 10 or 20 -- let alone 20 years ago. So a lot of the indexes we're building are rules-based active portfolios. They are taking an active bet on the market, but based on rules. So I think that this distinction is also important because the -- it's much less black and white. And the market for rules-based indexes that have strategies I think is 
 [Audio Gap] 
 potential besides clearly the market cap representations of them. 
Andrew Wiechmann: Craig, I'll just throw out some rough numbers because I know you've asked about it in the past, and we'll continue to refine these. And these are a little bit dated, but broadly speaking, active -- equity active AUM is in the ballpark of $22 trillion, equity indexed assets are in the ballpark of about $14 trillion. And these are global figures. On the fixed income side, active is closer to $28 trillion and on the passive side within fixed income, $4 trillion. So the other point to underscore here is there are significant opportunities across other asset classes, including fixed income. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. 
Simon Clinch: I was wondering if you could go back to the point about the opportunity for ESG with corporate customers. And I was wondering if you could perhaps expand on the competitive landscape you see in that environment and how you think it might develop? And ultimately, what kind of size you think that opportunity might be perhaps in the context of the size of the market you see on the more investor side of ESG? 
Henry Fernandez: So the opportunity really opened up in the sense of initially more of as a necessity in which the corporate client base wanted to know how they were rated by MSCI and how do those ratings compare to others in their industry or in other industries. So they kept asking questions, and we said, "Well, why don't we sell them the -- we're not going to give the information for free. Why don't we sell them the sector rating profile to them?" So there is a large market for that because we raised 10,000 issuers right now -- actually, we raised like 20,000 issuers, about close to 10,000 or so are in the -- 8,000 to 10,000 in companies and another 10,000 to 12,000 are fixed income issuers and growing, right? And then we're going to get into ratings of private equity, private credit and all of that. So that opportunity by itself is just selling them data. 
 I think the area that we're now -- that is starting right now. That's already in flight, obviously, from a small base and all that. Then the next phase will be what do we do to help these people aggregate their data and display their data to investors? How do we connect them directly from us, from them to the investors, and does MSCI play a role in that? That's still in the drawing board at this point, but that could present another opportunity. 
Simon Clinch: Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, I was wondering if you could just go back and talk about the retention rates in the Analytics business. I know you referenced some of the challenges facing the industry. Obviously, it's been a tough year. But I was wondering if you could talk -- give us a sense of how to think about that trend through '21? And if there's anything in particular we should note about the dip that we saw this quarter? 
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. Sure. So couple of things to highlight, and I mentioned this earlier, we obviously saw a dip in the retention rate this past year. It was primarily driven by 2 segments: hedge funds and within hedge funds, with smaller hedge funds and then within banks. And it was particularly one large cancel in the quarter from a bank. We continue to see, we believe, relatively healthy sales within Analytics, and the pipeline right now looks reasonably healthy for 2021. And so we're optimistic. We think on the cancel side, a lot of these are not in the most core parts of the franchise. And so we are hopeful that those will continue to moderate and trickle through to growth going into 2021. 
Simon Clinch: And I would just clarify that the -- so the large bank cancellation was this quarter? 
Andrew Wiechmann: Correct. Yes, Q4. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Henry Chien from BMO Capital Markets. 
Sou Chien: So I wanted to ask a little bit about the investments that you're doing. I mean you talked a good amount of color on the discipline that you're carrying to enact it as well as some of the product and market and client segments. If I try to put that together at a high level, I don't know if you have like a TAM or way of the world that you see in terms of the total type of addressable opportunity or maybe the -- just like an entrepreneurial thing, you just keep going on and finding new business. And any color around that would be great. And maybe a comment on the regulatory environment as it relates to ESG and whether that's a big enabler as well. 
Henry Fernandez: That's a good -- but it's part of the latter than the former. We are in an industry in which we are creating the industry, to a large extent, creating the industry of an index for every portfolio and investment tools for every critical investment decision. And that's one. The second part is that we have a lot of demand. We have a lot of people coming to us and say, "Can you build me an index for this? Can you do this? Can you give me a better software? Can you be -- can you help me with my ESG? Can you help me with my risk?" Et cetera, et cetera. And there is a huge amount of client interaction on that. So we are at a stage in which it looks like the addressable market is large. We haven't spent any time and effort trying to measure how large it is because we're like -- we're cherry-picking. We're picking all the fruits that we can as fast as we can, and that will last a number of years. So why try to take a centrally planned approach to developing models as to the total addressable market. 
Andrew Wiechmann: And Henry on the regulatory front, clearly, it's headed in the right direction. I think with the change of administration in the U.S., it seems like it's going to be more conducive in terms of encouraging more ESG disclosure and better ESG practices, which naturally benefits us. I think you see some tangible examples of regulation in Europe that are starting to impact us, including TCFD and the impending SFTR regulations which require disclosures, which we are very well suited to do, and we're well positioned to help financial institutions make the required ESG-related disclosures, and we expect those types of trends to continue. 
Sou Chien: Got it. All right. And I guess just the last follow-up. Sort of separately, but looking at passive just being such a large share of at least the U.S. equity markets. And I know it's not technically your role in terms of you provide the indices and the data. But do you ever think that there are any -- there might be risks around just that passive starts to impact equity market structure in a way that limits its growth? 
Henry Fernandez: I mean I think we're far still from that at this point. The -- I think the area that is obviously always of [ question ] is that a big part of passive investing is momentum investing, obviously. I mean the higher the weight of a company into an index, the more people buy the company. But that can be said about a lot of different ways of investing, right? That's not just attributed to passive at this point. So I think we've got to sort of peel the onion on that and look at the underlying purchases that people make. I think what passive has done is created a major revolution for people to focus on asset allocation and not just stock picking. And that is -- go from sectors to geographies to the fixed income versus equity and all of that. And it's freed up an incredible amount of time. So it's created enormous value for society because, through these packages or bundles of securities into an ETF, for example, you can move around much more easily. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. 
Keith Housum: I know we're running long here, so I'll try to be quick. Andy, just following up on a comment you made in your script regarding -- I think it sounds like there were some delayed deals and whatnot that you described. Can you perhaps provide a little bit more color on that? Was this like a pull forward of business? Or do you think this is a business that you guys were able to close more because of the opportunities you're offering this quarter? 
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. It was a little bit of both. I think it was a tool that was, I think, instrumental in helping some clients right on the heels of the pandemic when it unfolded and was well received by certain clients. It's also a tool that has been helpful with, I'll call them, large strategic deals for clients who might be signing up for a significant purchase of one of our offerings and using it across their organization. And maybe just to provide a little bit more color on how these things are structured. 
 And firstly, before I do that, I just want to underscore. I don't want to overstate the impact of these. This is just one component of what drives the disconnect between run rate and revenue, but it is something that we used more this year. We will likely use them going forward, although I think that the pace should not increase materially. But the way, these work, and maybe I can give you just a quick example to make it very tangible. So if a client signs up to an agreement to access one of our products, at the beginning of the contract term, we provide the client with access to the product for, say, 3 months at no cost. And let's say, the client pays us $180,000 for the next 12 months. 
 So in that case, we would recognize the $180,000 as a sale and the run rate goes up when the client signs the contract. So that's at the beginning of the free trial period, if you will, or that period where they're not paying. Although we will recognize the revenue of the $180,000 over the 15-month time period. So we'll effectively be recognizing that $180,000 over 15 months, which works out to about $144,000 of revenue for the 12 months after the contract is signed. So when we book the sale and recognize the sale, we take the full $180,000, but we only have revenue of $144,000 for the subsequent 12 months. When that client renews, so when they renew, it's for an annual term, again, this is all just illustrative. But when that client renews, it's for an annual term. Assuming no price increase, they would stay flat at the $180,000. And so the run rate and revenue sync up on the renewal for the second term. 
Keith Housum: Got you. And then is it possible to perhaps quantify, I think that was like 1% to 2% of your growth in your run rate business? Is that too much? 
Andrew Wiechmann: Yes. I don't want to give the specifics, but I would say it was something that -- and we've mentioned this in the past, was used within Analytics. We've used it in Analytics in part with some large [indiscernible] solutions type deals. We have used it selectively within ESG as well. But I would -- just to mention it a little bit, I would say the impact within analytics is not greater generally than the impact of implementations, where we won't start recognizing revenue until the implementation is complete even though we recognize the sale when the client signs the contract. And so that tends to have a bigger impact than these types of things, just to mention it. But we did want to call it out as something that increased slightly in 2020 and may have an impact going forward. 
Operator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over back to Henry Fernandez, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. 
Henry Fernandez: Well, thank you very much, everyone, for attending today. We look forward to speaking with you again during our Investor Day event on February 24. In the meantime, please stay well and stay safe. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. We will have further instructions for you at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Salli Schwartz: Thank you, Operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter 2020. This press release along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call, as well as a brief quarterly update are available on our website, msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures including, but not limited to organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures in the Appendix pages of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time, the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We therefore caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenue. Additionally, we will discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Andy Wiechmann, our CFO and Chief Strategy Officer. Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My colleagues and I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy. During the third quarter, and despite the challenging environment for our clients, MSCI had strong financial performance including total revenue growth of nearly 8%, run rate growth of 11%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 31%. MSCI continues to play a central role helping investors build better portfolios for a better world. We are executing our mission in two key interrelated ways, creating indices that serve as underlying components or client portfolios, and equipping our clients with the essential ingredients for them to build their own optimized portfolios. Indices as underlying components for client portfolios include benchmarks for active managers, replication tools for index managers, and underline indices for listed futures and options, restructured products and OTC derivatives. These indices can cover a very wide spectrum of client portfolio construction needs from equities to fixed income, from market cap weighted to ESG, and climate overlays, and from factor films to thematic mega trends. Consequently, indices as underlying components have a vast number of used cases, and therefore our business opportunities in this area are enormous. The essential ingredients to equip our clients to construct their own optimized portfolios include our factor, risk and performance models, our ESG ratings and screenings, our climate metrics and value and risk models and tools for thematic and mega trend exposures. Across these two interrelated offerings, we see incredible opportunities that expand new product areas, new client segments, and new capabilities. New product areas include fixed income, ESG and climate and the remedies to name a few. New client segments include wealth management, corporates or ESG offerings, and insurance companies for fixed income offerings. New capabilities in support of our new product areas and new client segments include the enabling technology and the strategic partnerships that we're looking in a wide variety of different areas and with different entities. In my comments today, I will focus on opportunities in four new product areas, including ESG and climate, fixed income and liquidity, thematic investing and derivatives. In future calls, I will comment on all the areas of strategic focus for MSCI. I'll start with our ESG and climate franchise. This quarter it reached at run rate of $192 million, growing nearly 50% year-on-year. Approximately $15 million of this run rate relates to climate and has grown over 100% year-on-year. We continue to firmly believe there will be a large scale reallocation of capital and repricing of financial assets over the next few years. Climate change, the move to a low carbon economy, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and other environmental, social and governance shifts will deeply impact where capital is invested. MSCI is uniquely positioned to deliver the solutions to navigate this massive shifts. Specifically in the ETF marketplace, we continue to see the launch of new ESG and climate equity ETFs linked to MSCI indices. At the end of the third quarter, assets under management in this ETFs have grown an incredible 186% year-on-year, reaching $71 billion. Our acquisition of Carbon Delta a year ago has also helped us to supercharge our climate capabilities. We now offer climate value at risk for investors across multiple asset classes, including most recently for real estate investors. As you can see, we're aggressively expanding our capabilities in ESG and climate, and we'll continue to build on our established leadership in this space. Our fixed income franchise continued to grow this quarter as our strong position in ESG and climate enabled us to capture more opportunities. AUMs and ETFs that are linked to Bloomberg Barclays, MSCI, ESG fixed income indices ended the third quarter a nearly $12 billion more than doubling from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched 22 MSCI proprietary equity income indices including eight ESG and climate change indices. With this launch, we now offer the market a total of 40 MSCI proprietary fixed income indices across ESG, climate, factor and each one's waited. As you can see, our strategy and fixed income indices is to partner with other index providers including Bloomberg, Barclays, iBoxx, iTraxx and others and to launch our own proprietary indices. In fixed income, we have also seen great progress with our liquidity analytics. We and our partner IHS market are delivering most ad solutions that help investors understand and manage fixed income liquidity risk. This has been critical for investors to meet growing regulatory requirements. MSCI has already been well positioned to support our clients with ESMA liquidity regulations in Europe that went into effect in the third quarter. Looking forward, we're also favorably positioned to help clients with potential liquidity reporting requirements in others jurisdictions around the world. Another product area of strategic focus for us is thematic investing. MSCI has built partnerships with Ark invest, and a number of other experts specializing in thematic investing. These relationships have generated indices focus on disruptive innovation and long-term structural changes or mega trends. We are seeing excellent traction across a range of used cases from ETF licensing to structure products, which Baer will discuss. Finally, I will comment on derivatives. We continue to drive the strong growth of multi-country, multi-currency MSCI index derivatives. This is a massive opportunity in its own right, but it will also reinforce this trend of our index franchise for both active and index investing. We're experiencing great success with this partnerships in this the futures and options with some of the world's most prominent global exchanges. Additionally, we're seeing tremendous opportunity to license our indices to broker dealers and banks for the creation of OTC derivatives and structured products. These efforts reinforce the virtuous ecosystem over MSCI exchange traded products. Before I turn the call over to Baer, I am excited to announce we're planning a virtual Investor Day event for February 24 next year. Please hold that morning in real times, open on your calendars. We'll have additional event details for you over the coming weeks. We very much look forward to sharing with you the many significant opportunities MSCI has to serve our clients needs globally and to grow with the investment industries a strong underlying secular trends that create tremendous shareholder value opportunities for us. We will talk about our expansion plans in products and client segments and the capabilities we need to build out our MSCI to capitalize on this significant potential. To make the event as complete as possible, we will continue our active dialogue with all of you and all of our investors, including through surveys, and listening doors. We look forward to hearing your views on how we can continue to optimize the MSCI franchise to achieve even greater shareholder value. Let me now turn the call over to Baer.
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry and greetings everyone. I'll start by noting an exciting milestone for our Index segment which reached $1 billion in run rate for the first time. We achieve this through growth in both the new product areas that Henry discussed, and more established products like our market cap weighted indexes. Across MSCI, we continue to find many opportunities to produce content once and defined multiple uses for it to address a number of different client needs. I'll give a few examples within some of the product areas that Henry highlighted. Leveraging our broad ESG and climate content has enabled MSCI to contribute to further transparency and standardization in ESG disclosures. In September, we launched a tool to help investors evaluate their portfolio exposures and alignment across the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our real estate climate VaR service has gained immediate traction with several new sales during this quarter. This combines our real estate data with climate change related calculations to create new value for real estate investors. An added benefit to the launch of real estate climate VaR is that many of our real estate clients now view MSCI in a new and innovative light. As a second example, this quarter we launched a new suite of MSCI Fixed Income Climate Change Indexes, which leverage our existing data in ESG and climate and apply them to fixed income benchmarks. These indexes enable institutional credit investors to build more climate resilient portfolios. They also allow investors to implement strategies that consider opportunities and risks associated with the ongoing transition to a lower carbon economy. Another product area we have frequently referenced on these calls is the relicensing of existing MSCI indexes for the creation of listed and OTC derivatives and structured products. As an example, this quarter we saw new OTC product creation from our broker dealer clients in the form of total return swaps on our ESG Leaders indexes. This activity was soon followed by the establishment of new positions in-listed derivatives on MSCI emerging markets ESG Leaders futures. We believe the potential for further growth in the ESG derivative space is very strong. Another great area for derivatives growth is thematics. Earlier this year, I mentioned we were working with a partner on a series of thematic indexes focused on the important areas of innovation in genomics and robotics. During this quarter, we want to license with the European Bank for a new OTC swap based on an MSCI thematic index related to the circular economy and renewable energy. This swap is expected to drive structured product issuance in the region, and is another good example of the MSCI linked derivatives opportunity. As of the end of the third quarter run rate for exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to MSCI indexes was $49 million growing over 60% year-on-year. We see significant potential in this space and believe the opportunity could represent hundreds of millions of revenue several years from now. Just as we are leveraging our content for multiple use cases, we're actively pursuing an open architecture strategy to push that content to clients through a variety of distribution channels. Earlier this month MSCI ESG ratings were introduced on Bloomberg Terminals, which are already a major distributor of our index data. Clients now have another ready mechanism to incorporate MSCI ESG ratings into their portfolio analysis and investment processes. MSCI is adapted quickly and well to the remote working and virtual engagement model. In the third quarter across the company, we drove over 10% subscription run rate growth. This result reflected strong contributions from across our client base, including both established and Emerging Client segments. MSCI’s client centric approach has provided ongoing benefit not just to sales, but also to the retention of our existing business. MSCI’s overall retention rate for the third quarter was 94.5%, improving approximately 100 basis points compared to the second quarter. Analytics retention rate had a notable improvement increasing 180 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. Our team's creativity and dedication to solving problems for clients has been critical as global engagement models continue to evolve during the ongoing pandemic. We have previously spoken with you about our senior account manager and key account manager programs to engage with the C-suite level executives that our largest clients. These clients collectively represent 65% of MSCI’s total run rate. And the retention rate for those clients was over 96% in the quarter, clearly demonstrating the power of our focused and integrated client approach. I'm encouraged by these milestones and look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to make progress on our key growth areas. Let me now turn the call over to Andy who will discuss more specifics of the financial aspects of our quarterly performance, over to you Andy.
Andy Wiechmann: Thank you, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call this morning. As I step into the CFO role, I'm excited to lead our talented finance organization and reengage with our shareholder and analyst community. I’ll be especially focused on further aligning strategy and finance to deliver even greater value to our clients, our employees and our shareholders. As Henry and Baer have noted the third quarter was another quarter of strong execution for MSCI. Operating revenues grew nearly 8% and recurring subscription run rate grew over 10%, reflecting solid performance across the business. Assets under management in equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes ended the third quarter at $909 billion. This reflects strong cash inflows of nearly $27 billion across all geographic exposures during the quarter. Over 75% of these inflows were allocated to ETFs with international exposures, which is a reversal of the trend we saw on the first half of the year. Approximately $7 billion of the inflows into MSCI linked funds went into U.S. exposure funds, where we continue to have strong market share capture of flows driven by continued flows in the ESG and factor products. In fact, equity ETFs linked to MSCI ESG and Climate indexes experienced cash inflows of $11.4 billion during the quarter. Additionally AUM levels were supported by improvements in equity market levels with $57 billion of appreciation from the end of the second quarter. As an update since the third quarter as of October 21, assets under management in equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes have further improved to approximately $942 billion. I'll now review our asset-based fee revenue results, which were up 4.5% year-on-year reflecting higher results across the board, including from ETFs, non-ETF products and futures and options. Sequentially, the nearly $117 billion improvement in quarterly average AUM levels and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes aided in driving 15% higher asset-based fees from ETF products versus the second quarter. The average basis point fee on equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes remained unchanged quarter-over-quarter at 2.67 basis points. A proportionally higher mix of AUM and international exposure funds provided support to maintain this level. Additionally, asset-based fees from futures and options increased sequentially, with results reflecting improvements in economics we received from our exchange partners. I'll now turn to our adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year. Underlying business performance drove nearly half of our $0.52 improvement in adjusted EPS. This included both operating revenue growth and relatively flat year-over-year expenses. As the expense controls we put in place earlier in the year, as well as continued benefits from lower travel and entertainment expenses that largely offset our ongoing investment initiatives. The balance of the adjusted EPS improvement was primarily driven by lower tax rate in our third quarter and year-to-date repurchases of MSCI shares. The lower tax rate in the quarter was primarily due to a change in estimates, as regulations were released relating to 2017 tax reform. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to have strong confidence in our capital position and liquidity. Client collections have been healthy. As you've seen from our results, investors continue to turn to MSCI for mission critical tools. This strong liquidity position affords us the flexibility to continue to be highly opportunistic in pursuing our capital allocation strategy, as we've done in the past. During the quarter, we completed nearly $207 million of share repurchases and returned over $65 million in dividends to our shareholders. Since the end of the quarter and through October 23, we've repurchased an additional $51 million of our shares. Before we move to Q&A, I will highlight some of the changes to our outlook for full year 2020, which we announced in our earnings release earlier today. We now expect adjusted EBITDA expenses to be lower for full year 2020 in the range of $710 million to $730 million. Our expense outlook reflects lower expenses in areas like travel and entertainment, as well as the impact of the continuation of Triple-Crown investments that we are pursuing as the environment stabilizes. Our continued investment in these Triple-Crown opportunities could result in an uptick in expenses relative to the last couple quarters. We also expect a lower effective tax rate for 2020 in the range of 11.5% to 13.5%. Our adjusted tax rate should run approximately one percentage point higher than our effective tax rate as it has year-to-date through the third quarter. CapEx will now be in the range of $50 million to $55 million. And for free cash flow, we now expect to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million, primarily reflecting stronger cash collections. Full year interest expenses still expected to be approximately $158 million. However, as we've pointed out to you before the ongoing low rate environment is also likely to drive quarterly interest income earned on cash balances to be at similar levels to this quarter for the foreseeable future. From where we stand today, the sales pipeline remains strong and client engagement remains robust and dynamic. Nonetheless, we remain cautious given that the operating environment remains unpredictable. With just a couple days to go before the U.S. elections as well as the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic, the range of outcomes in global markets and operating environment remains broad. In any case, we continue to believe our durable all weather subscription-based business model will hold up well as it has to-date. We therefore remain focused on continuing to support our client innovate and ultimately drive forward MSCI’s growth algorithms creating compounding value for all of you. And with that operator, please open the line for questions. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
Manav Patnaik: I just wanted to ask how you guys were thinking or how we should think about this new wave of I guess consolidation that's starting to happen also or at least be talked about a lot in the press with the large asset managers or your big clients. And I was just hoping, you know, you could help us understand how we should take to some of these as they get announced?
Baer Pettit: Yes, Manav. Hi, good morning. It's Baer here. So look, I think that, our experience in this is somewhat mixed and certainly not as negative as it might look on the cover. So first of all, the consolidation has not been that large this far. And so far as we have seen some cancellations notably an index related to it. As a general rule over time when firms consolidate, we sometimes have initially a little bit of a negative hit, but then typically we're able to grow the combined company, larger company in very healthy ways. So as of today, we're not seeing a significant impact and as a general rule, historically the outcomes have been pretty positive over time.
Manav Patnaik: And if I could just ask around the investments back in March, April when you guys obviously cut some in response to the COVID pandemic, how are those investments doing today, are they coming back, are they still on hold I guess potentially in that space and further lockdowns, just curious how you're thinking about the conflict levels and going through with some of these investments?
Henry Fernandez: So the first thing that it's important to note Manav is that the set of opportunities that we have to solve for clients problems is very significant. And it has actually increased very largely since the start of the pandemic. Obviously, we can point to ESG as an example, but also in fixed income, as well in thematic investing obviously the pandemic and the economic dislocations have created significant changes in the way industries are structure, and the business models and the likes of those shifts can get reflected in some of these mega trends and the emphasis that we're putting on that thematic mega trend investing in order to create indices and structural problems and things like that. So the number of opportunity has increased. Now, at the start of the pandemic like everyone else, we reigned in a bit the base of investments that we had a few months later, say two, three months later, we felt very comfortable with where we stood in the financials of the company and the outlook we were seeing this increased demand for our products and services, and therefore we have stepped up on the renewal or rebasing of that investment program. Some of that increased hiring and increased investment is reflected in the EBITDA expenses in the third quarter, obviously offset by decline of expenses in marketing and travel and entertainment, and a lot of things due to the lockdown, but we did see a pickup on that. We will likely see an increased pick up on that in the fourth quarter and in 2021, because we feel that this significant opportunities that the operating environment is presenting to us, need to be capitalized with a lot of new products and number of new clients segments, and a lot of new capabilities in the company. So yes the investment plan continues is that - it is a few percentage points below where we wanted it to be at this point. But we're stepping up significantly on increasing it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
Alex Kramm: Just quickly on the retention rates, nice pickup quarter-over-quarter, as I think you had hoped for. But still I think on a year-over-year basis, I think cancels are still a little bit elevated. So just would be interested to hear some comments, is this pandemic related, you made obviously some comments around as a management M&A, I think it's a little too soon for that. But anything else that give us confidence that cancels will continue to - particularly lower out from here.
Baer Pettit: Yes. Hi, Alex Baer here. Yes, so I think the simplest way to answer your question is we're sort of continue the guidance from last quarter. We are doing everything we can to service our clients. We are in an environment that is still a bit choppy and noisy in various clients segments, there can be some consolidation as Manav mentioned. There can be some certain client specific events. So directionally, we're clearly pleased with what happened this quarter. We're going to keep trying to do the best we can to keep the retention rate as strong as possible. But we are in circumstances where the market and what is happening to our clients may put a little pressure. So hopefully, in the balance of all that we'll get some good outcomes and that's what we'll be working towards.
Alex Kramm: And then second one also quick one here on the asset based fees. You know, the ETF numbers are pretty self-explanatory. But can you talk a little bit more about the other two components on the - I guess, index mutual fund side surprised to see that pick up quarter-over-quarter? I think that's usually on a delayed kind of like charging and I think 2Q was obviously a bad quarter. So surprised to see that tick up quarter-over-quarter. And then on the futures and options, wondering how much there were any sort of one time fees related maybe to the Hong Kong Exchange coming online, anything that may not be recurring because there was an outsized quarter again here on futures and options?
Andy Wiechmann: Hi, Alex. It’s Andy. Good morning. Maybe to start with the second question first on that the futures and options run rate, as we noted in our remarks, we are benefiting slightly from improved economics from our exchange partners, most notably in Asia versus the prior quarter, I would highlight that we continue to be very optimistic and excited about the broader derivatives opportunity. Even though, we saw volume tick down quarter-over-quarter, we are seeing big opportunities in both the listed derivatives market, as well as the over the counter market, which is showing up in more the index recurring and non-recurring revenue side. On the non-ETF passive front, I would highlight it's more than just index based mutual funds. Actually, a meaningful component of the revenue we see there is coming from what we call institutional path of revenue. And so it's more dynamic than just the index mutual fund trends that you might be seeing more broadly. If you highlight, we tend to recognize revenue on a quarter lag, where we depend on our clients to report to us average AUM levels. And usually, we get those AUM levels reported to us on generally a quarter, but it can be sometimes more than a quarter. And so it's not a kind of direct quarter lag correlation if you will. The other thing I would highlight is it's a very dynamic equation where we can see some positive movements in price particularly in some of the big growth areas like institutional pass of mandates for ESG indexes or custom indexes or factor indexes, where in many instances we might have more attractive economics in those types of indexes. So long winded way to say that it is a very dynamic equation, there is some relationship related to AUM moves in the prior quarter, but it's much more complex than that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. Henry, I wanted to ask a broad question on ESG. The markets been growing really nicely, you grew your ESG and climate run rate at 46% this quarter and continue to be the first mover there. Could you just talk about what you view as your most important differentiators and how you've been able to build on those? I think the question that I get a lot is, how MSCI can keep the number one position as more competitors try to grow in the space. And so, if you could just talk about what differentiates your data capabilities on the index side relationships, anything you want to add there? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: So Toni, the competitive advantages that we have on ESG and now obviously, a major step up in climate change tools are significant, a lot of multiple number of competitive advantages. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, a lot of what we do at MSCI gets captured in two big, interrelated trends, right. When we take all of our capabilities and put them into indices, which form underlying components for portfolios. On one hand and on the other hand, provide all the ingredients, the essential ingredients, to build portfolios, by our clients themselves from, from scratch so to speak. So on ESG, think about all the capabilities we have, we are the largest rating agency in the world for ESG. So we provide huge amount see in ratings on an instrument or investment-by-investment basis. So all of that then gets so, we're the largest equity, cross border equity index provider in the world. So we can combine the ESG ratings with the equity indices. We're now putting all of that, the ESG information that we get into risk models, which we're the largest provider of equity risk models in the world. So we can monetize on that we are putting all of that together into the fixed income space, in which - we take all the ratings on our fixed income, in the fixed income instruments around the world and put it in there on the light. So we have a whole broad of ecosystem that fits on one another from structure products, to futures and options to index, indices, to any single security of information about ratings and all of that, to factor models in equity and fixed income. And on the other side on the client side, we are compared to some of our other competitors. Our client base is the investor, and therefore, where the highest demand for ESG tools is from investors. Not from corporates at this point or issuers, the highest client advantage investors, there are very few people in the world. And like us we are well positioned on the investor side to capitalize on that. But having said that, we're expanding into the corporate sector, to provide a lot of these ESG ratings on a sectorial basis to a lot of our corporate - to corporate entities. So that they can look at it and figure out how to provide disclosures and improve the information that they provide in order to get better ratings, from people like us. So multiple is a quiver of arrows, that is going to be very hard for anybody to break in, you know, that's a huge moat that we have in this business. And lastly, we have a first mover advantage in the whole world right.
Toni Kaplan: That's great. And Andy next one for you, just congrats on your new role. I'm not expecting that there'll be dramatic change in strategy, especially since you've been part of the leadership team for a while now. Just maybe you could talk about how you think about the potential for margin expansion from here over time? Just given operating leverage, but also investment needs, should we be thinking about sort of a X basis points per year of expansion or EBITDA growth and low double digits or what kind of framework do you think of when you're thinking about margins, and the potential for further business? Thanks.
Andy Wiechmann: Thanks, Toni I appreciate the remarks. And as you said no, real major change in strategy, particularly given my experience with the company and my role and strategy previously if anything. I think the combination of strategy and finance creates - opportunities for us to create even more value - where we are as a company right now is faced with enormous opportunities across all aspects of our company. And so, the next leg of value creation for the company is going to be really prioritizing where we are placing our incremental debts and where we're placing our incremental investments to chase those opportunities. As Henry just talked about with ESG making sure we're being proactive in capturing these very attractive markets and really continuing to differentiate ourselves and so, if you will - the financial algorithm. I'd say is not changing significantly at this point, other than to say we have an intense focus on investment here. Going back to Henry's comments to the first question, the margin in this current quarter was higher than what we would like. I think that's a reflection of some of the, some of the activities we took earlier in the year and reduced expenses in areas like, like T&E and professional fees and marketing. But those are masking some of the accelerations investments we’re making. And so, as we continue to make those accelerations in these investments we go to our upturn playbook, and we're intensely focused on our Triple-Crown framework, where we are investing and those opportunities that have the highest return. The shortest payback, and are most valuable to us and our shareholders we are going to continue to invest in those attractive opportunities. So I think you'll see likely a pickup in expenses in the fourth quarter. And that will trickle through the next year, where you will continue to see I think, an acceleration and investment through next year and higher expense growth. And so, it's not a dramatic shift other than to say the emphasis is really on driving investment here. And I think that's going to be the core source of long-term value for us. And if you'd imagine we'll probably talk more about this at Investor Day in February.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. You may proceed with your question.
Chris Shutler: Question on ESG. So many large asset managers are using multiple providers of ESG data as kind of a an initial screen, which then feeds into more proprietary ESG analyses that they put in place in-house. So the question is, do you think that the ESG business remains fairly fragmented with asset managers using several providers at the same time? Just given how subjective ESG is and how different some of the ratings can be amongst the providers or do you see that changing over time? And do you think that the desire to work with multiple providers places any kind of cap on how much asset managers are willing to spend on ESG?
Henry Fernandez: So definitely, it's a good question. And let me try to explain how we view it. In everything that we do at MSCI is - we want to position ourselves as close to the investment decisions by our clients as possible. And therefore, what we're trying to do is to give clients really made already analyzed, already thought through solutions to some of their problems and to capitalize on their opportunities. So, we are uniquely positioned to do that in creating ESG equity indices. ESG fixed income indices, ESG at risk models, in order to set in - equities and fixed income, and we're starting to look into on develop plans to do that in the private asset classes as well. And all of that, in order to achieve that, you clearly need the underlying data, the underlying ratings, and all the research associated with those ratings, you need the screenings and the exclusion research that we do. And all of that, but it is not sufficient it’s a necessary condition, but it's not sufficient for success. So where you see competition, for us, it’s in the provision on the underlying data. And on a lot of our clients are subscribing to various sources of data, for sure. But ultimately, that data needs to be translated into a tool for an investment decision. And therefore, we'll see some competition in providing underlying data it’s perfectly fine with us. But we are - where our position is very leading and very prominent is in providing the derive the tools that are derived from that data in order to help people make better investment decision in that space. They're not going to be too many people like us.
Chris Shutler: Henry, just a quick follow-up on that, would you be I mean as you think longer term around the ESG franchise? Do you see yourselves developing some kind of a tool that integrates other third-party ESG data with yours and combines it all as a solution?
Henry Fernandez: Definitely, that could definitely happen. We're not working on that this very moment, but that definitely happened. And this is in the spirit of the strategic partnerships that are at the core of our MSCI strategy. We want to partner up with everyone in the world that wants to do with that with us in order to serve our clients. And for everyone to win and to make money in all of this and that - will definitely be the case in ESG data. We already are partnering up with smaller institutions that provide data. An example of that is the Carbon Delta acquisition it started as a partnership in which Carbon Delta was providing us with climate metrics and climate value-at-risk to create joint product. As we develop that partnership, we became very, very close to one another and the Carbon Delta management team and the shareholders decided that it was better that - they would join forces with us. That didn't have to happen, but that was an example of a partnership. And we have a few more of those. And we would like to do those with the bigger providers of ESG information as well. But it obviously they may view us as competitors, and they may not want to do that. But our intent is to do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research. You may proceed with your question.
Craig Huber: I have couple questions. One, can you talk a little bit about the price environment from your perspective - I mean revenue growth speaks for itself. Can you just talk about the pricing both within analytics that you're able to get in this environment and also within your index subscription area please, I have a follow-up?
Henry Fernandez: Yes hi, Craig. Yes, so look my simple headline is great stability in pricing. We're not really seeing any, I would call it unusual pressure or any fundamental changes in the pricing environment at present. So, look that could change in the future, but right now, nothing to suggest that our pricing power has been affected in any material way.
Craig Huber: And then secondly, can you sighs for us your institutional passive products area I guess including the direct to index scenario, whether it be AUM basis or as a percent of your revenues within indices for example?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes Craig, it's Andy. So we haven't put out the institutional passive AUM levels in the past. I can say that it is larger than the ETF, AUM just the nature of that market. These are big assets, and the fees tend to be lower generally than the pricing we get on ETFs. You've obviously seen the revenue that we put out, so you can mention how big the revenue is to us. But this is a significant opportunity particularly on the institutional passive front that I alluded to earlier. We're increasing the institutions or investing directly into an index. And in many instances, those are kind of customized indexes to help them achieve their objectives. And so many times those will involve ESG overlays, factor overlays, increasingly things like thematic type considerations. And so, we're very excited about that opportunity. You alluded to the direct indexing opportunity, I think it's very similar, but for a different client base. So with the rise of direct indexing particularly in channels like the wealth channel, we are in a very unique position to. As Henry was talking about in his opening remarks either provide the index that the client can invest directly in or provide the ingredients that the wealth manager can use to create an index that's directly suited to that client. And so, we think we're very well positioned to capitalize on both opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question.
Owen Lau: Yes, thank you for taking my question. Could you please give us an update on your partnership with Burgiss. So what are the new products in the pipeline, and maybe which product you think can move the needle longer-term? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Yes so, at the beginning of this year as you know we announced the equity investment in Burgiss. And we had spent a meaningful amount of time in the prior years working with the Burgiss databases to create risk models in private equity, for example for our multi-asset class, enterprise risk and performance product line. So, on the heels of that equity investment, we have now launched into a wide range in discussion about many other areas where we can partner in the use of that data. And that got slowed down in the second quarter. We started in earnest in the first quarter, it slowed down in the second quarter and through the summer, because of the disruptions on the pandemic. But it's now back on track, and examples of that in the last say month and a half or so, we have held very significant very senior level discussions with the biggest and alternative investment managers in ways in which we can partner up with them strategically. And help them with a lot of their needs, on data and analytics to capture a bigger pie of investment opportunities from the institutional investors or the LP clients. So that has not yet monetized. But for sure, the dialogue that we have is at the most senior level, extreme high levels of interest to do this, and the likes. The other thing that happened is, as you saw Jay McNamara, you know, was a longtime executive at MSCI, who was named President of Burgiss. And his mandate is to build a state-of-the-art client coverage organization for Burgiss in terms of sales and relationship managers and consultants and marketing people and - commercial product management people and all of that. So, Jay is very busy at work in building that. And with that front office organization in a much higher state is going to coordinate very closely with the MSCI client coverage organization in order to expand significantly the sales and the penetration that the Burgiss and MSCI have in clients around the world. So they're kind of two areas of collaboration, there is the sales and penetration with clients and the second one on the product side trying to do joint products in either evaluated pricing or expansion of the data sets or risk models or the light.
Owen Lau: And then for the demand from a broker dealer for OTC derivatives and structured products linked to MSCI indexes. Could you please help us understand the growth a little bit more here? And I think you mentioned one example for that, which is a new product. But was - the growth mainly driven by volatility with the same client base or you can actually increase the penetration here? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Yes, sure. So, I think it's really a strategic shift. Clearly, market volatility doesn't hurt. But I would say that if we look back on this segment historically, our approach was much more to just take our existing indexes and licensed them. Today - so it's more like a product sale type of relationship. Today, we're in much more of a service mode with these clients. We're typically involved much more in customization. Some of that customization is also involving our analytics tools as well as our indexes and on a variety of new methodologies. So, I think it's really a pretty significant shift in focus, a step-up in servicing, and we hope to continue to be able to see pretty attractive growth from the segment based on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. You may proceed with your question.
Keith Housum: I was hoping you might be able to give - provide some color on the sales environment in terms of how it compares now versus I say a normalized environment? I mean it certainly looks like your sales are doing fine. But would you start to say you're able to sell without any issue even with the work from home constraints of all your geographies are still same?
Henry Fernandez: The short answer is yes. I must say it's - it has been both I would say in a large effort and a pleasant surprise. So, we've put enormous focus on ensuring that we have all the right focus, first of all, just purely keeping the teams together, keeping the teams motivated from a managerial point of view. We've enabled them with technology, so that pretty much everything that we can do in terms of demos of our products, et cetera can be done online. And in many instances, we found that for example, for client events we actually have more attendance than we did in the sort of physical attendance days. So I think, in terms of the sales process, where things are going really well, I would say the mechanics of it. And I think that that's reflected in pretty, pretty decent sales that we've been having in view of the circumstances.
Keith Housum: And then Andy just little more geography here, you talk about the investments that you guys have made? If we look at the income statement, is most of that investment going in the R&D or the cost of goods sold line, but where can we kind of see that investment as it flexes?
Andy Wiechmann: Yes, it's kind of spread across the board. So clearly, there is an element that shows up in R&D, and you seen some modest growth there. But there is also an element that goes into cost of selling and sales and marketing as well. So when you think about the nature of these investments, it's mainly headcount and the bulk of our costs are compensation related. And that's the case for investments as well. So it's hiring technologists that's hiring researchers, and its hiring sales people to go after these new opportunities. And so, depending on the exact roles, you'll see those spread across mainly those three buckets in the income statement.
Keith Housum: Yes, thanks. Appreciate it.
Henry Fernandez: What I would also add is that the - over the next two, three years, you're also going to see a geography change in terms of a move from our own data centers. And our own production environment, in which a lot of the investment is CapEx to the Microsoft Azure Cloud, which we mentioned that in the summer on our announcement and therefore, we see a significant amount of savings and a significant amount of scalability of our production environment. And in terms of the expenses associated with that, they will go from CapEx and therefore depreciation more into EBITDA expenses as time goes by, and we'll keep you apprised of those changes. So that there is no confusion in terms of what's happening to the EBITDA expenses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Henry Chien with BMO. You may proceed with your question.
Henry Chien: Good morning Henry and congratulations Andy on the new role. I wanted to ask a little bit about the strategy. It sounds like especially with the partnerships. And it seems like there is a lot of new solutions being developed with each call, is this a significant or it's just a - is it the change in strategy in terms of how we should think about it in terms of going through more partnerships? I guess it seems like it's more of a license model, or is it more of a service model. Yes, if you could just explain that a little bit, and how should we think about that, and I guess with some of these new products, where do we see that in terms of the metric? I'm assuming most of it's in index, but just trying to understand how to track that as well? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: It is definitely a - I will not think of it as a quantum jump on strategy, but it's definitely a change in the evolution of the strategy and you could think of it is in the - first of all in the concepts that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, which is how do we capitalize on these two big areas that we are operating on there, which is provide indices as underlying for portfolios, and the opportunities that there is immense because pretty much every portfolio in the world can have an index to serve as a guide, a benchmark could be passive replication, or could be for the creation of baskets for structural products or for OTC derivatives, or obviously indices of any kind and all types for futures and options. So that's - and then what are all the ingredients, some of them are off the shelf, some of them are customized, some of them are market cap, some of them are factors, and ESG, some of them are climate, some of them are thematic in terms of the big mega trends in the world, they could be equities, it could be fixed income, and eventually there will be product asset classes that can be used in a variety of ways. So that's a big - I think is more of a recognition of the role that we're playing in the investment industry, and how that role can become even bigger by also having this mindset. The second part is obviously the ingredient, that we use those ingredients ourselves to build those indices. So you might well have all those ingredients available to the client base on that. So therefore, that's one part of it. The second part of it is that, when we see orders buying companies all over, in what we say, should we be buying a lot of those companies, should we be buying all those capabilities, and in some cases, we will especially as smaller bolt-on acquisitions that will accelerate the work that I just described. But in many cases, in organic tools, don't have to be an outright acquisition in a competitive bidding process with very high prices, lower returns sometimes, execution risks and all of that, we say, why don't we be partnered up with a lot of those firms, many of those firms don't want - for the number of firms that want to sell themselves, there are a lot more that would like to partner up with us to create joint opportunities. So we have made that partnership central, partnership for clients. Of course, we always done that. But partnerships with people that gave us data sets that we don't have, partnership that give us distribution, partnership that gives us ability to have the knowledge and expertise like in thematic investing that we may not have, let's say biotechnology, we're not the world's experts in biotechnology, why don't we partner up with a biotechnology investing firm? So we can create those themes and those underlying indices for underlying portfolios, and all of that. So central to what we do is our answer to we don't have to own the whole world. We're a small company with limited resources. So why don't we partner up with people in order to jointly serve the needs of our clients and everyone wins.
Andy Wiechmann: Maybe just to add, Henry touched on M&A and the potential for tuck-in acquisitions or bolt-on acquisitions. As you know, we're extremely disciplined - financially disciplined, but also strategically disciplined to the points that Henry made. And capital we are very protective of our capital and we look at the returns we can get across all uses. And I would highlight that discipline, as you can see, on the share repurchase front where we repurchase today its year-to-date, over $600 million of our shares, at prices, on average less than $300 per share. And so it's always a trade-off in terms of the uses of our capital.
Henry Chien: Yes, okay. Okay. Makes sense. Yes. Like a [indiscernible]. So I guess just a quick follow-up. So when you mention combining finance and strategy, I guess what do you mean by that? Is it like the partnerships or taking minority stakes or just how to what I guess, how should we think about that like I don’t know what that mean.
Henry Fernandez: It's a fair question. Yes. And probably a novel concept. But it's mainly focused actually on the organic prospects. And so when we think about what is going to drive the most value for the company over the next several years, there are some important trade-offs we're going to have to make as we've talked about here, we have a wealth of opportunities in front of us. And so where we place every incremental dollar of capital is going to be extremely important and so we need to have very robust framework that we use, like our triple crown framework to think about what is going to be the best return on that incremental investment dollar. And what's going to be most strategic for us over the long-term. There is also an element of an intense focus on efficiency. And I'll call it strategic efficiencies. So thinking about how we can position the company from an infrastructure standpoint, from a process standpoint, from a technological standpoint to create scale and really turn what we do into a competitive advantage for the company going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jake Williams with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.
Jake Williams: I appreciate the color on ESG provided, one follow-up question we had is within the ESG indexes revenue, can you break out what is asset based and what is subscription based, at this directionally?
Henry Fernandez: So just to be clear, Jake within the ESG research reporting segments, which shows up in all other that is purely just our ESG research and rating. So that's things like our screening tool or ratings. There is no asset base fee that is running through that segment. All the asset base fee revenue is coming from ESG indexes, which is reported within our index segment. Now when we show the integrated ESG run rate, which you've seen, which is a run rate figure, the portion coming from index, so the ESG index run rate does contain a asset base fee component, but we have not broken out that detail at this stage.
Jake Williams: Is it fair to assume that within that ESG index run rate section that it's half and half for? Is it more heavily weighted towards subscription or asset based?
Henry Fernandez: Hopefully we can give more detail in the future. I don't want to dimension it right now other than to say they're both meaningful, they are both growing. And just looking at the growth in the assets under management in ETFs linked to our ESG indexes, which have grown 100% year-over-year, you can imagine the asset base fee component is growing at a very robust growth rate within there. But the other point of reference I would highlight is you can see on our slides, we do highlight the index subscription run rate growth within ESG and factor modules. And you can see that that is growing at 21%. Now, there is competing dynamics there between factors in ESG. But you can tell the subscription components growing at a very healthy growth rate as well.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Henry Fernandez for any further remarks.
Henry Fernandez: So thank you very much everyone for attending. In the run up to Investor Day in February of next year, as we said earlier in the call, we will be reaching out to many of you either directly ourselves in listening tour couple of environments, or some of our people that we work with, we'll be reaching out to you for surveys and opinions on how best to optimize our franchise. We encourage you to take full advantage of that to provide us with feedback, ideas, and the like and even if you don't get reach, please do not hesitate to reach us directly as well. If you have ideas and thoughts, we welcome them to put them all into our thinking as to the best way that we can describe our company, what we're doing, our opportunities, our investments during that [Virtual] Investor Day. Thank you very much and stay well and safe.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. We will have further instructions for you at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin. 
Salli Schwartz: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter 2020. This press release along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call, as well as a brief second quarter update are available on our website, msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures including, but not limited to organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures in the Appendix pages of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run rate, which estimates at a particular point in time, the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client agreements for the next 12 months, subject to a variety of adjustments and exclusions that we detail in our SEC filings. As a result of those adjustments and exclusions, the actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from run rate. We, therefore, caution you not to place undue reliance on run rate to estimate or forecast recurring revenue. Additionally, we will discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Linda Huber, our Chief Financial Officer. Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Strategy Officer will also join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. MSCI's second quarter performance once again demonstrates the resilience of our franchise and the mission critical nature of our content, analytics and technology applications for investors, particularly during these times of market uncertainty. Specifically, today, we reported solid operating revenue growth of 6.2%; strong adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.8%, reflecting our ability to tightly manage expenses; and strong adjusted earnings per share growth of nearly 15%. As you are aware and we have discussed in these calls, we have a number of strategic initiatives underway at MSCI. First, we are expanding our coverage of asset classes to include areas in fixed income and private assets. Second, we are creating new products that can apply to a specific asset class or across multiple asset classes. These new products include content in ESG, climate change, factors, risk models, thematics and futures and options just to name a few. Third, we are broadening our reach to newer client segments like wealth manager’s, insurance companies and corporates. And fourth, we are transforming our technological capabilities, not only to benefit our clients but also to enable our employees to operate even more effectively in the virtual world we're living in. We have made significant investments in these initiatives and I'm very pleased to report that these investments are yielding strong results. During our call this morning, I would like to highlight three areas. First, in ESG and climate change, we have continued to expand our content, including research on key topics, additional ratings coverage and new indices in both equity and fixed income, and risk models that integrate ESG and climate change variables. These investments in ESG and climate solutions are providing significant returns. In the second quarter, our ESG franchise across the whole company performed very strongly, reaching a run rate of $174 million. ESG research itself reported its highest ever quarterly subscription sales. And in ESG Indices, AUM in equity ESG and climate change ETFs linked to our indices almost double year-over-year reaching $55 billion at the end of the quarter. We are encouraged by investors' increasing adoption of our tools to effectively integrate ESG and climate change criteria as a core component of building resilient portfolios. And we believe our ESG solutions have the additional benefit of driving transparency and creating standards for many market participants. As you know all too well, we have long believed sustainable investing is a critical part of the long-term investment process. Our early moves in this area have given us substantial leadership and competitive advantage, which we will continue to capitalize. A second area I would like to highlight is index, futures and options. We are helping our clients build the various elements on an -- of an MSCI ecosystem of financial products with deep liquidity on a wide range of market exposures. This ecosystem includes ETFs, listed futures and options, OTC swaps and options, and structured products all fitting and benefiting from one another. Recently, and as part of this important initiative, we significantly expanded our relationship with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing further aligning MSCI with a global exchange leader in the Asia time zone and enabling deeper and more liquid markets for MSCI-linked futures and options. We believe Hong Kong provides access to and the benefits of a large client base, including Mainland China investors, a significant pool of liquidity, and an ecosystem of both listed and non-listed derivatives. And the third area that I would like to highlight is, our investment in our technological transformation. Last week, we entered into a partnership with Microsoft that will not only strengthen and scale our infrastructure, but also continuously improve our client experience. Our transformation through Microsoft Azure includes an advanced global network of data centers, a fully integrated cloud infrastructure to provide massive scale and product delivery, and sophisticated artificial intelligence and national language processing capabilities. We intend to take full advantage of all the benefits that this partnership can bring to MSCI. Facilitated by this partnership with Microsoft, we will be able to help investors more swiftly and efficiently manage data and understand better the drivers of risk and return in their portfolios. Despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we will continue to selectively invest in the highest-returning areas of our business both to further position MSCI for growth and to drive operating efficiencies. As you can discern from my remarks, we continue to execute well and obtain significant returns in the areas we're making strategic investments in. I would like now to turn the call over to Baer to go over our efforts in more detail. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. I'm quite pleased with our team's high effectiveness in working completely remotely with clients this past quarter. Our results clearly demonstrate our success in adapting to a virtual engagement model. We also continue to roll out new content and capabilities across the firm. In June, we launched Real Estate Climate Value-at-Risk, a forward-looking tool that provides real estate investors and managers with the ability to evaluate and review climate exposures and concentrations across their portfolios. We also launched Index Metrics, a service to provide investors the ability to evaluate, compare and monitor strategies linked to MSCI indexes. We introduced a mobile app on iOS to support investors with real-time access and performance information for MSCI indexes. And in May, we made 36,000 ESG fund ratings publicly available on msci.com and launched the MSCI Index Profile tool to provide better access to ESG metrics for both ESG and non-ESG Indexes. During the quarter, we drove new recurring subscription sales growth of 16% against a strong second quarter last year and amid the current uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. ESG in particular reported its highest quarterly subscription sales on record with growth of 93% over the prior year. Index recorded over 20% higher sales growth, featuring strong growth in non-recurring sales, which benefited from increasing demand from broker-dealer and bank clients for bespoke OTC derivatives and structured products linked to MSCI indexes. Analytics new subscription sales were also strong growing 10%. Offsetting some of the strength in sales was an elevated level of cancellations, particularly from certain bank and hedge fund clients. While a modest number of the cancellations could be attributed to COVID, particularly among hedge funds most are the result of ongoing restructuring within our clients' businesses. Overall, MSCI's retention rate for the second quarter was approximately 200 basis points lower year-over-year, a respectable outcome allowing for the context. The retention rate in our Real Estate business was notably strong at 96.2%, which helped offset some of the weaker sales. Looking forward, while we do not have any indication at present in the pipeline that elevated cancellations are a trend this environment is unpredictable and could be subject to change. I'd like to spend a few minutes on our Index segment. In the second quarter, our clients launched approximately 30 new ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. The vast majority of these were ESG and climate products. In July, 17 MSCI index future contracts began trading on HKEX, with an additional 20 expected to launch in the near future. We also extended our agreement with the Singapore Exchange for the listing of both futures and options on the MSCI Singapore Index. Year-over-year futures and options run rate grew 85%. However, volumes and contracts created for futures and options linked to MSCI indexes declined sequentially as we observed a reversion to normal levels of market volatility versus at the beginning of the year. As you are aware, and can see in our results this quarter, we have remained very disciplined in our expense management in this environment. We have nonetheless continued investing in our business as Henry noted. For 2020, we targeted and have been executing against a $140 million investment program to change the business. These investments span across Index, where we continue to build our infrastructure and functionality to enable clients to get more sophisticated and timely indexes, client coverage, where we made select key hires to our global leadership team; ESG, where we have a range of investments for example in improving our climate capabilities; and select other high-return opportunities that support our business growth and enable greater operational efficiency. Before I turn the call over to Linda, I thought it might be helpful to provide an update on my client segment commentary from last quarter. Asset managers continue to drive the largest mix of new subscription sales across MSCI through both new and upsell opportunities, and this past quarter had a retention rate of 94.6% despite continued industry pressures facing active managers. We're seeing ongoing traction in client segments we have targeted for growth, including for example wealth managers where we have more than doubled new subscription sales year-over-year and corporates where we're beginning to put dedicated sales coverage. We have also had success increasing our footprint with asset owners, who are particularly active in implementing climate strategies, across asset classes providing MSCI with attractive opportunities for our climate solutions. Finally, for hedge funds, we are seeing two different cohorts. The crisis has pressured some funds to exit their strategies and/or restructure sometimes leading to cancellations with MSCI. Others have performed exceedingly well, and in some instances are inclined to acquire more of MSCI's content, analytics and technology applications. Hedge funds have therefore been both a source of higher cancellations, but also of significant recurring subscription sales growth. As we enter the second half of 2020, while we continue to observe tighter transaction and procurement controls from certain clients, we remain confident in the overall long-term trajectory of our franchise. Let me now turn the call over to, Linda who will discuss more specifics of our quarterly performance. Linda?
Linda Huber: Thank you, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call this morning. The second quarter was another quarter of solid execution for MSCI. Operating revenue grew just over 6%. And recurring subscription run rate grew nearly 10%, reflecting strength in Index recurring subscriptions and ESG as well as more modest growth in asset-based fees, Analytics and Real Estate. Turning now to assets under management, assets under management and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, ended the second quarter at $825.4 billion, recovering nearly $116 billion, from the end of the first quarter. All of this AUM improvement came from a rebound in market levels across all exposures. During the second quarter we saw net cash outflows of $1.5 billion, driven by ETFs with international exposures that were only partially offset by positive inflows into ETFs, linked to MSCI indexes with U.S. exposures. Notably, sequential cash inflows into equity ESG and climate ETFs, linked to MSCI indexes totaled $10.4 billion. Additionally, equity ETFs linked to MSCI Factor Indexes saw $2.9 billion of inflows from the first quarter. As of July 22nd assets under management linked to MSCI Indexes has further improved to more than $880 billion. I'll turn now to asset-based fees which were up slightly at 0.4%. We recorded substantially higher year-over-year asset-based fees in futures and options, linked to MSCI indexes, which grew more than 90% to $8.6 million in the quarter. Asset-based fees from non-exchange-traded funds linked to MSCI indexes were $26.8 million, growing approximately 7%. Year-over-year, the relatively flat AUM levels and lower basis point fee levels, resulted in a decline in asset-based fees from equity ETFs, linked to MSCI indexes. Sequentially, the basis point fee on equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes decreased 0.04 basis points, predominantly reflecting a mix shift into funds with lower total expense ratios. We ended the second quarter at 2.67 basis points. Our quarter-end ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes was higher among U.S. exposures sequentially and year-over-year. Our international market exposures in emerging markets and developed markets outside the U.S. were down year-over-year, but both have increased quarter-over-quarter. And I'll turn now to our adjusted earnings per share growth grew year-over-year. Higher subscription revenue was the largest driver of our almost 15% growth, in adjusted earnings per share. Excluding the impact of FX and including depreciation and amortization, total expenses increased slightly. This was offset by our tighter expense management in the quarter, including the hiring freeze we noted during our last earnings call, as well as significantly lower travel and entertainment and other non-compensation expenses. The balance of our adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by favorable tax and foreign currency impacts and a lower share count. These were offset by higher interest expense associated with the higher debt balance during the second quarter, as well as lower interest income on cash balances. And turning now to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.4 billion. And in May, we issued $1 billion of notes due 2031, at a coupon of 3.875% and used $800 million of the proceeds to redeem our 2025 notes that had a coupon of 5.75%. We remain very confident in our capital position, which continues to enable us to invest selectively and strategically, in our businesses and to return capital to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased $31 million of stock and paid approximately $57 million in dividends to our shareholders. And yesterday, the MSCI Board also approved a dividend, increase of 15% to $0.78 per share for the third quarter. This is in line with our payout target of 40% to 50% of adjusted EPS. Now moving on to our outlook for full year 2020, as we announced in our earnings release earlier today, we are reiterating most of our lines of guidance as we continue to invest in our business, for growth and operating efficiencies. We do now expect a lower effective tax rate for 2020 in the range of 16% to 19%. And for free cash flow, we now expect to be toward the upper end of our guidance range of $540 million to $600 million, primarily reflecting the lower effective tax rate range as well as stronger cash collections. Full year interest expense is still expected to be approximately $158 million. However, the current low-rate environment is also likely to drive quarterly interest income earned on cash balances to be at similar levels as this quarter, for the foreseeable future. In closing, I want to reiterate Henry and Baer's confidence in our business model, people, operations and opportunities. We have a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity. While the range of economic and macroeconomic outlooks remained broad, we will continue to take proactive management decisions in the best interest of our employees, shareholders, clients and other stakeholders. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Question-and:
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. The retention rate stepped down a little bit this quarter but the new sales were very strong, especially in ESG and Analytics. And I think that's the opposite of what I would have expected just in the current environment. So you mentioned, restructuring within client businesses, just wondering if you're seeing that continue into the third quarter, and just any sort of extra color on the drivers of retention and new sales that you were seeing this quarter and if those are continuing. Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Hi, Toni, Baer here. So look, I think that the sales numbers reflect the positive actions that we were able to take in the quarter and the fact that we were really up – able to get up and running very strongly and continue our client outreach activities, et cetera. So clearly, the pipeline for some of the items is – it was longer. So I'm not suggesting that business was all originated within this quarter or the tail end of the previous one. But overall, the – we found that we really had a pretty strong quarter for sales activity and we continue to see that and we're pretty pleased about it. So when we look at the cancels, as we've mentioned a bit earlier in our comments the – a certain amount of those were more related to the current environment as perhaps you had thought, notably a little bit on the – notably on the hedge fund side with small or medium hedge funds and a few other categories. But the sort of restructuring of client business that we allude to were typically longer-term things. There were a few cases of both sell-side and asset manager clients, removing themselves from certain lines of business. And those things were not necessarily things that had occurred because of COVID or short-term market circumstances unlike the hedge funds. There were some structural cases. One example was a sell-side firm that had reduced a lot of its activities in equities and similar things of that kind that were happening over time. And then additionally, as always there are a few – there's a – I would say, those were the larger percentage and a smaller percentage of normal competitive type of things. So looking forward, I would say that our – there are two things which are a little bit in contradiction to each other but not entirely. The first is based on our current view of the pipeline, we do not have strong evidence that cancels will continue in a bad direction. We don't have that evidence but I just want to reinforce that point. Equally, in view of the extraordinary circumstances we're in, which include the fact that the pandemic is certainly not over unfortunately in the United States. And while it appears somewhat better in other parts of the world it could recur. And the macroeconomic indicators are clearly very poor and a number of these sort of supporting – the macroeconomic support for individuals and companies will cease towards the tail end of the year. So those things mean that we continue to reiterate what we said last quarter that we expect that the cancels will likely continue to be a challenge but we don't know where that will come from at this stage. We're just being cautious in view of the environment. So that's kind of a little bit of a summary for you there.
Toni Kaplan: That's very helpful. And hopefully on a brighter note, could you give some additional color on the strategic alliance with Microsoft? Is there a way to quantify…
Baer Pettit: Sure.
Toni Kaplan: I know you talked about quicker speed to market on some new product development. And so any sort of quantification would be helpful. Thank you.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So look, by the way, the brighter note also did include sales, right just to reiterate that. We were pretty happy about the outcome. And in view of how we – with the extraordinary changes we went through during the quarter, we really do view that as a positive. So look on Microsoft, I'm very excited. Spent a fair amount of my personal time on this along with Jigar Thakkar, our CTO. So there's both – the element, if you want to call the mechanical element of the cloud migration, there's enormous amounts of things that Microsoft can do with us in terms of creating efficiency and speed to market, notably in our DevOps, which are on different standards because of history across the company, where we are already seeing in certain categories that we're just bringing software to market much more quickly than we were even six months ago, because this relationship with Microsoft has already started in a few areas such as that. We also think they can do help us a lot on our internal what people typically call corporate technology, where there's a lot of efficiencies we can gain. And then additionally two more categories, one is with ESG. We think there's some really interesting things there in view of Microsoft's global touch with corporations and the huge focus that corporations have on ESG. And then finally with advanced technologies, which by the way one area we're using a lot of those advanced technologies such as AI natural language processing, et cetera is in ESG, but also in other data operations we think that they can bring a lot of value. So it's really a holistic thing. We've -- these discussions have been going on for quite some time and we're delighted with the outcome. And we think this will be a great deal for MSCI and a great partnership with Microsoft.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks, Baer. Sounds great.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe I can just follow-up on that question. And if you guys could just maybe refresh and let us know, you called out the ongoing technology transformation. So maybe you could just give us a kind of snapshot of where MSCI is today and what that technology transformation actually means or where you're heading towards?
Baer Pettit: Sure. Okay. So just carrying on from my previous observations. So look one major theme in this is creating both innovation and efficiency across MSCI. So because of the various -- the history of some of the acquisitions that we've done over time, we've had -- we have a lot of different applications in front of clients and those -- we're seeing a path where we're creating much greater commonality in the underpinnings of those both in our data environment where we've already made a lot of progress in the last few years, but we think we can make even more progress going forward. In our client applications where I think the look and feel of the client experience with MSCI technology in, let's say, even a year from now let alone two or three years will be much more uniform, much more standard and much more user-friendly. We're also -- so data is the first one. The client experience is the other. And then I think as I said, the third one is in terms of the way that we operate internally. All of our processes which link from the client through the client coverage organization through to finance -- those are also an area where we see a lot of efficiency coming. So just as we said a number of years ago going back even four or five years ago that the One MSCI story was both a client-focused story and I think we've shown that by the unified segments, we've started to create with ESG and with factors. So I think we're on a kind of a second wave of that going forward and technology is a huge enabler of that. 
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you for that. And maybe just a quick question around your expanding client segments that you called out. I mean what is typically the entry sale to get into an insurance company or the corporates, for example? Is it different from the traditional? I just wanted to get some flavor there. 
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So the -- in terms of our Plan segments, we traditionally have been very strong in pension funds, clearly all forms of asset managers, long-only and long/short asset managers and banks and broker-dealers. So we want to expand further with the banks and the broker-dealers, especially, on the heels of all these listed futures and options to help them create a large variety -- to license our indices to create a large variety of structured products and OTC -- swaps and OTC options and the like. On insurance companies we have been in the past a bit challenged in penetrating insurance companies for their own principal account not necessarily only their asset managers, but their own principal accounts because we were not as strong in fixed income in our portfolio management. And as you know, insurance companies have a very large percentage of their assets in fixed income products. As we have been launching fixed income risk models, fixed income indices with ESG overlays and factor overlays and the like that presents a significant opportunity for us to expand into life insurance companies as well as with our Real Estate product line. On corporates, the big impetus right now is ESG. We already are collecting a meaningful amount of data from corporates in terms of their disclosures about ESG and specifically on climate change, which we send back to them to review and analyze. So there's an ongoing series of operational relationships that we're developing with them. And we're now looking to sell them data sets for ESG for them to understand their own ratings and compare themselves to each of the other participants in their industry on ESG and on climate change. Eventually this partnership with Microsoft will be in another direction to see if we can create a bit of a data platform that will benefit corporates and investors alike.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
Alex Kramm: Yes, hey everyone. Quick ones from me I think. On the expenses, Linda, you didn't change your guidance but it's still fairly wide. ABF is doing much better than it did a quarter ago. So, I assume to push up expenses a little bit too in terms of performance comp et cetera, or where do you see the remainder of the year shaking out given how business is doing right now?
Linda Huber: Sure Alex. As you noted we've done a pretty good job of expense management. We have been able to do a number of things including maintaining the investments that we're planning to make in the company at about $140 million. And everything that we've talked about on the call today is already baked into the expense forecast. So, nothing is incremental. Part of this will hinge on how the rest of the year looks and that's why we're leaving a range that might be a little bit toward the wider side and performance has been pretty solid given everything that we're facing. So, we continue to be very selective about hiring. We continue to be very focused on our expense base. T&E of course is reduced sort of around $2 million a quarter given that we're largely staying in place right now. So, I think we'll keep that range and we'll see how the back half of the year comes together. But we feel pretty good about everything that we've done and the way the business is running right now. 
Alex Kramm: Okay. So, it's too early to not just any sort of lower end higher end or something like that at this point right?
Linda Huber: Yes, I think so.
Alex Kramm: And then maybe for Baer I mean you noted the strong ESG sales first quarter. I think you talked about a variety of different things. But can you maybe just force-rank kind of like the -- where the sales came from in terms of like largest buckets of new sales what kind of products? And that's particularly on the subscription side obviously not the Index side.
Baer Pettit: Yes. So, the pattern of the sales has been pretty consistent. So, we continue to have -- heavily focused on the ratings data area. That's the really main driver of the sales. The area where we continue to see a pickup is in climate. And I would say that the discussions in climate they have increased very -- fairly significantly in the last six months including during -- with all client types. And so all those things take a little bit of time to come through and become more material. But I would say that the main story remains the broad one of going deeper and broader with clients. And look the one element that I would highlight that is probably -- first of all, we had a very large sell-side deal during the course of the quarter. And I would say generally the discussions that we're having are going more broadly with the sell side as well as the -- traditionally the asset managers and the asset owners. And that in turn is -- and I know you mentioned that it was mostly on the subscriptions that I'm -- that you asked a question about but I do think it's important to note that that is also heavily linked to the various financial products be they structured products ETFs where you saw that we continued to have a lot of issuance. Because in turn those people who deal with the -- with those -- with creating those products in turn they need more data and they need all of that for their infrastructure and sometimes for creating their own ratings as well. So, that's kind of the pattern that we're seeing and very broad and across the board. And I would say still primarily heavily in the Americas and in Europe but we're putting more focus on Asia and putting more client coverage resources there. And we hope that we'll see more coming from there in the second half of the year. 
Alex Kramm: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.
Bill Warmington: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Price has historically been an important part of revenue growth for the subscriptions in Index and I wanted to ask how you're finding success -- or if you're finding success in continuing that trend in this environment?
Henry Fernandez: I think it's the same. No difference in the pattern at this point. The source of additional revenues or additional sales that's coming from price versus volume continues to be the same mix, so nothing really new to report there.
Bill Warmington: Okay. So, for my follow-up question you'd mentioned the retention rate on the real estate was strong at 96%, but the organic revenue growth was down about 10%. I just wanted to ask what -- that seems like a disconnect. I wanted to ask if there was perhaps a volume component to the model.
Baer Pettit: Yeah. So look, I think there's one sort of, if you like, mechanical challenge we've had. We've been somewhat understaffed in Real Estate client coverage. We've now almost entirely remedied that. And those people take a while to come on board and be trained, et cetera. I think we may still have one open head count for Real Estate sales, but we're pretty much now got all those people on board. Most of them have -- not entirely all of them are out selling yet, but most of them have transitioned into productive roles. So, for sure, we would hope that on the sales side, that would be the major change that would create positive movement there. I think the retention rate is, I think, really a positive reflection of the enormous efforts that the Real Estate team has made in the last year, reaching out to clients. And we've actually had, I think, a pretty good quarter overall for, let's say, our research and thought leadership outreach to clients. Research -- Real Estate did a particularly excellent job with many client panels, so an MSCI research person and a client and a lot of interest in all of that. So, I think that the general client satisfaction that we're seeing in Real Estate is reflected in the retention rate. So, look, we'll see. Clearly in this environment, Real Estate as an asset class could be challenged a bit. But I think they're quite different drivers. One is more longer term. The retention rate is more longer term efforts, and the soundness of the business. And then the other one was a little bit just short staffing in sales. And then finally, there was just a little bit more technically the -- we had a slight drop in the revenue was due to some timing of deliveries and some FX stuff. But that's a little more of a marginal point-in-time thing.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research. You may proceed with your question.
Craig Huber: Thank you. I wanted to ask on fixed income. In the past you guys have described your run rate of revenues and fixed income being less than 5%. Just want to hear if I could, what you guys view as the opportunity there, both the analytics area as well as your industry business long-term. I mean, for example, in five years, is there sort of a number in your mind of what percent of revenues is aspirationally fixed income could be revenues? Could it be 7%, 10%? How are you sort of thinking about that? I've got a follow-up. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Yeah. So, we're very excited about our significant foray into fixed income portfolio management, analytics and index. And notice that, I say, portfolio management, because we traditionally have been fairly strong in fixed income risk and fixed income performance attribution for the middle office, the central risk management office of many of our clients. The areas that we see a lot of opportunities are to begin with, is fixed income indices, but not in the traditional sense of issuance-weighted or market cap-weighted indices, but more with an overlay of ESG on those fixed income indices and factors or a combination of ESG and factors. And that's an area that we just launched a wide variety of indices in the last, say, six -- eight, nine months. And there is a good pipeline of licenses for them in ETFs and other passive products and structured products and the like. So, I think that -- obviously that takes time to build up into a large revenue source, but we're very excited about that. We're also very excited about the fixed income analytics, particularly the new generation of factor models that we have launched in fixed income, which obviously feed into the factor indices and fixed income. And that's an area that we're putting quite a lot of effort. Also liquidity metrics has been a big driver of sales in Analytics and that has always a fixed income component associated with it. Lastly, fixed income analytics itself, not only content, in terms of the models, the factor models, but also on the workflow tools and the like. So, that's another area. We think that clearly, a company like MSCI, with the footprint that we have and the client base that we have, not to be one of the largest providers of fixed income analytics tools and indices in the world is not great. We think that there is, therefore, quite a lot of runway in that direction.
Craig Huber: I also want to ask you on the futures and options side, as you think forward here about investing in that business. Can you just touch upon on the opportunity there, in particular, as you sort of expanded your various relationships, I guess around the world with various exchanges out there? But, can you just touch on the opportunity on futures and options long- term? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Well, it's a very, very large and fairly immediate opportunity. By immediate meaning as you have seen the run-up in the run rate not only obviously based on the volatility that we saw, but much more importantly the normal volumes and the re-pricing of a lot of our licenses. So we started on this about a year ago and we reported that the first agreement was done last year in North America. The second agreement was done in Europe and this is the third agreement now in Asia. So we now have the complete sort of three major regions of the world. We have smaller agreements with smaller exchanges in emerging markets but the big ones are in place. And that's going to be big because not only the market for multi-country, multicurrency equity index futures and options is developing significantly, but also the structured products market. The other benefit of all of this is that the growth that we do here is extremely profitable growth because clearly this is all IP that has been created already. And the cost associated with all these licenses is the team -- the structure in as I said the over-the-counter team and structured products team in our broker-dealer client coverage to license our indices and obviously the futures and options team, but there's no cost of goods sold so to speak. It's all -- it's highly profitable. So this would be hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in the next 5, 10 years right? 
Craig Huber: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Shutler: Hi everyone, good morning. On expenses they grew less than 2% year-over-year in the quarter. Linda you mentioned $2 million a quarter of lower T&E impact which would help reduce expense growth by about 1% per year. I know that you're slowing the -- you did slower the hiring, but it looks like developed markets' employees are still up about 4% year-over-year. So maybe just talk about where you have cut back expenses and where you are finding efficiencies. 
Linda Huber: Sure. The most important part of this is, we've been as we said very, very selective with hiring. And you can probably see that the balance of our employees are still very much located in emerging markets versus developed markets. So we're managing everything very closely. And in addition to the headcount which still generally has to run through Baer and Henry to be approved for hiring, we are thinking about discretionary expenditures on consulting fees projects things like that. So with all of that, we've been able to manage our expenses pretty flat to the same quarter last year which has been a pretty great achievement. At the same time we're focusing very hard on our cash flow. You'll note that we've been able to move our cash flow guidance up toward the high end of the range which is a really good thing. That's dependent on the tax rate being lower as we talked about in guidance. And then, also the fact that we're doing particularly well with our collections, we're being very careful about our working capital and our collections. So that's been very, very helpful. So hopefully that gives you enough color, but we're quite proud of what we've been able to do on expense management particularly this quarter. 
Chris Shutler: Okay. Thanks for that window. And then on a different topic I want to come back to direct indexing just because it is so kind of topical or increasingly topical these days. And I know Henry you've talked about this in the past, but I just want to kind of come back to it and better understand the puts and takes for MSCI. I mean I would think from a -- the negative would potentially be for your fee rates, if comparing versus your average ETF fee rates today, but on the other hand, if more assets are indexed against your indexes that's clearly a good thing. So is this just another example of potentially trading price for volume? 
Henry Fernandez: Look, it's -- Chris -- and we now have Chris. I'm sorry to Bill that -- I thought it was Chris asking the question earlier, but it was Bill. So look I think the answer is the same which is, whether it's direct indexing or whether it's self-indexing or whether it's third-party indexing like, COS. At the end the overriding philosophy of MSCI is that, we're not in the business of creating indices. We're in the business of helping our clients build better portfolios which happens to be with our branded proprietary indices. But if the direction is going to be that they want to build a lot of their own indices to build their own portfolios, we will rent our entire infrastructure to be able for them to achieve the same purpose of building portfolios. And the -- and therefore there is a wide variety of clients that if they wanted to do that they're more than happy to rent the entire infrastructure. We probably will make more money renting the entire infrastructure than just licensing the end product that comes out of that infrastructure. So I don't -- we don't see that as a threat. We actually see that as a big opportunity. And we have a number of clients already that they're doing that and we've been actually pushing other clients in that direction, but it's slow going. Baer, you have some more comments on that as well? Baer, I think you're muted. 
Baer Pettit: Yes. The other point I would add to that is that the direct indexing opportunity actually does involve benchmarks not like it doesn't need them. And additionally, the -- typically the people who are involved need a lot of other MSCI tools. So we were actually looking at some very interesting opportunities. As Henry said, we're in the portfolio -- we're helping people build better portfolios. And precisely the type of people involved in this are heavily quantitative, use a lot of different models, use a lot of different portfolio software. So we don't really view it as a threat to Index that we typically view it as also a big opportunity in other firm.
Henry Fernandez: And by the way one of the things that we're beginning to embark upon is the next generation of our what we call the index factory going back to the technological transformation that we talked about earlier is, how do we create an index factory that lends itself to all sorts of use cases similar to the one we're just talking about in helping our clients build better portfolios through indices.
Chris Shutler: All right. Thanks a lot, Henry.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Henry Chien with BMO. You may proceed with your question.
Henry Chien: Hi, everybody, good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the planned $140 million in investments. I'm not sure if you talked about it before, but just wondering if you can give an update on the kind of key areas that you're focused on and any progress so far in those areas?
Henry Fernandez: So let me start with the broad landscape and then Baer will comment in some of the specific areas of investing. Yes, we traditionally haven't mentioned the numbers. So if you think about $140-plus million out of an expense base of $700 million to $750 million that gives you a pretty sizable part of our expenses allocated to this. So the $140 million can be divided up. More or less, 80% are operating expenses and those are the ones that are compared to the 700 -- $750 million. And 20% are capital expenses -- capital expenditures. And all of this is baked into the guidance that we gave you in expenses and capital expenditures at the beginning of the year. So no change from any of that. We see enormous -- really, really enormous opportunities for very high-return investments in our company with our clients. The win is in our back in so many different areas, whether it's more indices, whether it's more risk models, whether it's more ESG or climate change, private asset classes of course fixed income in a variety of different flavors as I've mentioned before. When you -- when we tally up many of these investments on a priority, many of them are investments that are in the triple-digit returns over a shorter period of time meaning one to three years. So we're not talking about long payoff and relatively low return. These are significant. And the reason for that is because a lot of these investments are made already on top of an existing infrastructure. So for every dollar of incremental revenue that we can get out of this investment, we increasingly have to put less dollars in incremental cost associated with it. So it's very much of a virtuous circle of success in these investments. And Baer, do you want to walk through a little bit of the breakdown qualitatively? 
Baer Pettit: Yes. So I think -- so Henry was fairly comprehensive there. So just a few maybe other slight ways to sort of skin the cat as it were. So the first one is -- well actually first is an overriding observation and Henry alluded to this, but we are extremely disciplined in looking through all the expected returns on all of our investments. And at the beginning of this period when we briefly slowed down some of them and paused at the beginning of this crisis, we actually kind of refreshed and reexamined the premises of all those things which we had not yet started investing in. And so I think we're pretty confident about our process and trying to be cold-blooded at looking at the return profile. The three big buckets if you think about it functionally are in client coverage, in the product areas for typically new feature functions and in technology. I alluded to some of those technology things earlier as it relates to the Microsoft partnership and some of the earlier comments, I made about technology. And those in turn have a fairly large overlap with analytics in particular where we think we can drive more sales through both a greater efficiency, speed to market and some of the additional content that Henry alluded to such as fixed income that we discussed earlier and other analytics. In turn, we're making significant investments in the Index infrastructure and building what we're -- internally, we have kind of a jargon for it which is Index 2.0, which is a new world of client experience for Index including, again, in this context, linking it to what we said earlier, when we talked about direct indexing, when we talk about helping clients, build better portfolios. It's that whole infrastructure of customized indexes, complex indexes like -- such as, thematics and all of that. Clearly, ESG is a critical category, and we continue to invest in ESG both technology and content. And so those are some of the big buckets across the board, and look clearly we don't have a crystal ball. But we're very -- I think fairly confident about at least the process we've been through to ensure that we're allocating capital to what we believe will be hopefully strong returning investments.
Henry Chien: Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Housum: Great. Good morning everyone. Thanks for the question. In terms of the Microsoft arrangement, can you conceptualize perhaps how are you thinking about it in terms of is this a net cost, or is it going to be a net savings, I guess, over the next several years? And if it's a net savings are you reinvesting back in the business, or does that flow to the bottom line?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So they are -- there are two parts if you want to think about it of the -- or three parts of the Microsoft partnership. The first part is clearly moving our -- all of our production and production environment and delivery to the cloud starting with Index and Analytics, and then subsequently going to other product lines. So that's going to be -- that's definitely cost-neutral to cost savings. With the caveat though, and I'm glad you're asking that question with the caveat that over the next two to three years, there will be a switch from capital expenditures and amortization to operating expenses, because obviously we'll be paying Microsoft what will be for us operating expenses, and we will not be investing in our server data centers and all the technology associated with that, right? So that's cost-neutral to cost savings. The second part is -- of the Microsoft is their ability to help us build new products, such as client-facing technology, as an example in order to drive more volume and more production into our processes. And in addition to that obviously the use of newer technologies to capture data like AI and natural language processing and machine learning to capture data for models for data capture for ESG, for example and for production quality in our Index factor. And the third part is clearly the intent to be able to work together on an ESG platform.
Keith Housum: So the second and third part will this be net cost then for you guys? I hope that's…
Henry Fernandez: Well, the second and the third will have their own business plans with them. But obviously, the revenue associated with that will need to surpass quite a lot the expenses. It will be subjected to the what we call the Triple-Crown investment criteria that we have inside MSCI, which is very high risk-adjusted returns; secondly, short paybacks; and then three, in areas of our business that have high multiples. 
Keith Housum: Got you. I appreciate it. And then just circling back to that $140 million of investments that you guys highlighted, how does that compare, I guess, to the prior year? And what would have been this year if not for all the events in the first quarter that carry on today with COVID?
Henry Fernandez: It's about 15% higher than last year and it's exactly the same dollar amount as we had at the beginning of the year. What did change was some minor adjustments in the focus. We de-emphasized certain products in the second quarter in certain areas in order to put the money in other areas that were more relevant given COVID and could give us a higher return and a faster payback.
Keith Housum: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
Alex Kramm: Oh, hey, again. Sorry to drag it out. One quick follow-up, but it's multipart. On the Hong Kong Exchange relationship a couple of things. One, I know I think you're excited about that partnership in Asia, and obviously, gateway to China and all that stuff. But is it fair to assume that the economics are also better than with your prior partner in the region? And then secondarily, anything that's already in the run rate for -- at the end of the quarter from that relationship? And then lastly, is it purely volume-driven, or how big is any potential component of kind of, I guess, regular ongoing fees that are not volume-driven? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: The -- that's definitely much better economics for sure. Secondly, none of it has yet hit the run rate and the P&L. They'll start this current quarter. And then three, it's mostly volume-driven with some minimum fees in case the volume goes through certain thresholds. And in addition to that obviously, it's not only the 37 futures and options contract, but obviously the desire to launch more, particularly the ability at some point to launch MSCI China A futures and options in Hong Kong.
Alex Kramm: Excellent. Super vision answer. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. You may proceed with your question.
Chris Shutler: Thanks. Just one follow-up. Henry, you mentioned working with Microsoft on an ESG platform. Just curious, what you envision that could eventually look like down the road?
Henry Fernandez: Well, it's too early to tell. And obviously it's still early in our discussions. But the -- we both recognize and are very keen on understanding not only ESG, but climate change and how do we connect basically providers of capitals and users of capital into a platform that they can both use to understand the data that can be supplied by companies and be used by investors and the models and the ratings and all of that. So -- but again, its early days, so I don't want to give the impression that any of this is cooked or anything like that. And we'll be reporting more as the discussions go on, but there is a very strong intent on both sides to try to work something out. 
Chris Shutler: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Henry Fernandez for any closing remarks.
Linda Huber: Henry, just a second, we wanted to do a few housekeeping matters before we ended the call. A number of you had asked some questions about the below-the-line items. So, just before we close, we wanted to note that interest expense was slightly higher in our second quarter by $2.2 million for the duplicate costs of our old 2025 notes and our new 2031 notes for 30 days, while we waited out the redemption period. And we have maintained interest expense guidance for the rest of the year. On interest income, we just like everybody to take a look at the fact that in a low interest rate environment, we're earning less on our cash balances than we had before. That's -- right now per quarter, we're earning about $1 million per year maybe a bit less. And in the previous quarters that's been a bit higher. So everyone should take a look at interest expense and interest income. The other questions we got were on the tax rate. And our 17.3% tax rate for the quarter was largely due to that loss on the debt extinguishment, which you can see in Note 10 of our financials. Secondly, we had a higher income tax benefit related to some equity awards which vested. And third, we had a favorable mix of earnings. So everybody can take a look at that. Also, I wanted to call everyone's attention to our increased dividend of $0.68, it has now been increased. And we'd just like to make sure that everyone models that correctly going forward to the $0.78 which was set yesterday. So with that, I think we'll turn it back over to Henry.
Henry Fernandez: So, once again, thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in MSCI. A lot of great questions that you had for us and I hope we're able to answer them as best as we can. And obviously, don't hesitate to reach out to us if we have -- you have other questions or comments about what we could be doing better. I hope we all stay safe and have a great rest of the summer. And we look forward to updating you for our third quarter earnings call in October. Operator, this concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Salli Schwartz: Thank you operator. Good day and welcome to the MSCI first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter 2020. This press release along with an earnings presentation we will reference on this call as well as a brief first quarter update are available on our website msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP we also refer to non-GAAP measures including, but not limited to organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures on pages 30 to 37 of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run rate growth figures which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Linda Huber, our Chief Financial Officer. Andy Wiechmann, our Chief Strategy Officer will also join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Like many of you, we are in various remote locations today. If we have any audio quality issues we appreciate your patience as we work through them. And finally, I would like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that let me turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy in this difficult environment. Before I turn our call over to our first quarter results, I would like to acknowledge this unprecedented times and share a few of the actions related to our people our clients and our shareholders that we have taken to manage successfully through this challenging environment. Across MSCI's 35 locations in 22 countries around the globe, we have deployed our business continuity plans in full force. Almost 100% of our 3500 employees are currently working remotely. They remain engaged and productive with the right tools to work effectively across all functions of the company. Our data processing production environment remains extremely resilient and reliable with an uptime of over 99.9%. Because we have been able to seamlessly transition to this new working environment, we have stayed keenly focused on our clients, supporting the challenges that they're facing in managing their portfolios and businesses. Our sales consultants and our client coverage representatives have provided immediate expanded access to our products and services. One example is by removing location restrictions of our products and services to support our clients as they work from home. We have delivered more frequent content updates and offered select free trials across our product suite in an effort that has been widely unpraised in the last few weeks. And our research team has mobilized rapidly to create a wide variety of insight and research analysis. This has been delivered to the market timely through social media, podcast, and our dedicated coronavirus web page. The allocates we have received from clients tell us that we're doing the right things to support them at this crucial time. I am incredibly proud of the way my colleagues have stepped up to work with our clients to serve whatever their needs may be, keeping faithfully to our mission of providing critical tools and insights to help clients build resilient portfolios, regardless of market conditions. And finally, we have taken a series of concrete actions to ensure MSCI remains well-positioned financially and that our shareholders continue to benefit from their support of the company. Let me now turn our focus to Q1 and how we will continue to navigate during this crisis. During the first quarter, we delivered strong financial performance across our franchise with year-over-year growth of 12% in operating revenues, 16% in adjusted EBITDA and nearly 23% in adjusted earnings per share. Since the beginning of the year and through April 24, we bought back $357 million of MSCI shares, a total of 1.4 million shares at an average price of $250.65. We also paid to shareholders approximately $58 million in dividends during the quarter. And our Board has approved the upcoming second quarter dividend payment of $0.68 per share. These actions are consistent with our stated objectives of managing our business with the most optimized capital structure possible and of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Our share repurchase program since the start of the year is consistent with our practice of taking advantage of periods of volatility in our stock price. And our dividend declaration is consistent with our policy of paying 40% to 50% of adjusted EPS in the form of quarterly dividends. As stewards of your capital and as important shareholders ourselves, we are highly driven to manage our company carefully through these times of economic stress and market uncertainty with an ongoing keen drive to innovate and strategically grow the business for the benefits of our stakeholders regardless of market conditions. As you know compensation costs are the most significant part of our expense base. Currently, we have a hiring freeze in place and only very few headcount additions are being made in critical areas. A significant part of our compensation expense is variable and meant to be flexed up or flexed down depending on the financial performance of the company. We are more focused than ever on driving productivity improvements and ensuring that our operations are appropriately scaled for the opportunities and challenges we see in front of us this year. As we continue to navigate this unprecedented and evolving environment, we are confident that MSCI's content, analytics and technology applications remain must-have tools for our clients, underpinning the resiliency of our franchise. The enduring secular trends and drivers supporting our business also propel our confidence and belief in our ability to add significant value to our clients and create more value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Baer, who will provide more color on what we are seeing and hearing from clients as well as examples of our ongoing innovation. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. I share your confidence in our durable business model and in our colleague's abilities to deliver significant value for our clients even in environments like this. Our focus therefore remains to engage with our clients in detail about their businesses and investments and to run our own ship tightly to ensure total operational integrity. We continue to closely manage expenses. I am personally reviewing every request for headcount and additional non-compensation expenditure to ensure prudence in using the resources entrusted to us. At the same time, we want to create catalysts for our clients to continue to rely on our tools particularly in the context of the ongoing uncertainty around the depth and duration of the pandemic and its economic effects. Over the past several weeks, we have intensified our engagement with clients providing research insights and tools to help them perform stress tests on their portfolios, identify key factors that reflect their investment views and rebalance their portfolios to achieve their objectives. We are delivering daily research content including pieces on liquidity, hedging risk exposures and the performance of various asset classes factors and other strategies. Responding quickly to events in the market, we have upgraded certain of our modeling tools to enable clients to more closely monitor recent liquidity constraints. For users of our multi-asset class risk tools, we have provided access to model portfolio stress tests to simulate outcomes across equity, credit, oil, foreign currency and commodity shocks. Many of MSCI's products and services have important risk management capabilities and these features become even more critical during periods like this when economies and markets are under stress. We had several bright spots in the first quarter. One was the continued adoption of ESG investing. We observed 120% year-over-year increase in assets under management in equity ETFs linked to MSCI ESG Indexes which reached $37 billion at the end of the first quarter. Year-to-date, we've observed $11.6 billion of cash inflows into ESG equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. Looking forward, we expect investors to continue demonstrating an appetite to implement these kinds of long-term sustainable investing strategies. And our research indicates this has been a successful approach during the crisis so far. MSCI ESG Indexes have shown resilience even more notably in the first quarter of this year. Another bright spot, I would like to highlight is our growth in index licensing for futures and options which is part of our asset-based fees revenue and run rate within our Index segment. The first quarter volume in futures and options linked to MSCI indexes grew approximately 54% year-over-year reaching over 40 million contracts. With ongoing market volatility, we believe clients will continue dynamically trading and utilizing the unique multicurrency, multi-time zone derivative products linked to our indexes. Our run rate for futures and options linked to our indexes based on annualizing our results from quarter end; now totals nearly $50 million which has more than doubled since last year and continues to be one of our fastest-growing opportunities. In fact our continuous innovation efforts will benefit a variety of facets of the ongoing growth in the company. As one example, we are currently working with a partner on a potential new series of thematic indexes focused on the important areas of innovation in genomics and robotics. This will add to our existing suite of thematic indexes ranging from digital economies to disruptive technology. This is just one example within our index franchise of our approach to creating tailored products to client demand across a wide variety of exposures factors and asset classes. Climate change remains another front-of-mind topic for investors. Most recently, we launched our Climate Value-at-Risk product in ESG. This effort has been a direct outcome of our successful acquisition of Carbon Delta in late 2019 and we expect will be an important growth driver for MSCI not only with new and existing clients in ESG, but also for our real estate clients. Before I turn the call over to Linda, I'd like to share what we are seeing and hearing from our clients and how that might translate into opportunities or even headwinds going forward. Our asset owner clients are proving to be resilient part of our franchise. The ongoing trend of insourcing assets continues to catalyze them into upgrading their risk management tools and embracing factor investing and ESG integration even in this environment. Banks and broker-dealers remain generally well capitalized and eager to improve their tools in index derivatives related areas ESG and liquidity risk all areas of strength for MSCI. Clearly the breadth and depth of the crisis will have a bearing on this going forward. I'm also encouraged by our progress within wealth management, an area we have targeted for growth. The crisis has heightened demand for more transparency and analytics among wealth managers. In response, we have had the opportunity to sell across new use cases that bring value to advisers. We are working to integrate our content into their platforms and reporting driven in large measure by areas where we have expertise such as ESG factors and Thematics. With regard to hedge funds, some strategies have suffered greatly from the onset of the crisis and experienced outflows as has been widely reported. Established players and selected other strategies have fared better. These firms have been keen to acquire more of the content analytics and technology applications, MSCI can provide in order to better navigate the crisis. We are acutely aware that this operating environment could evolve to create challenges in generating new sales and avoiding cancellations. Thus far, we have seen deals pushed out later rather than pulled completely. Procurement processes have become tighter and may become more so. Additionally, we could see even more lumpiness in some of our larger ticket product sales notably in analytics. At this point, the pipeline remains quite healthy and retention rates indicate that the must-have nature of our products holds fast. We are certainly focused on doing everything we can to maintain this position of strength as we progress through the year. The continued strong level of client engagement and the variety of client problems and opportunities we are addressing continues to highlight the strength of our franchise. Let me now turn the call over to Linda, who will discuss more of the specifics of our first quarter performance as well as our current outlook. Linda?
Linda Huber: Thank you, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. Let's start with a review of the first quarter's results and then move on to our capital position, our current guidance and our downturn playbook. For the first quarter focusing on operating revenue, MSCI recorded nearly $417 million, up 12% from the prior year. Looking at each of our business segments first in Index operating revenue grew approximately 16%. Growth in asset-based fees was a meaningful contributor of 22.5% year-over-year. In addition, we saw a close to double-digit growth in recurring subscription revenue driven by continued momentum across modules. Second, Analytics operating revenue increased more than 3%. We saw higher subscription revenue in our multi-asset class and equity analytics products. But noting Baer's comments, we would also remind you of the lumpiness we continue to see in this business. Finally, for the all other segment, operating revenue grew nearly 20%, reflecting robust growth across our ESG ratings and screening offerings and higher subscription revenue in real estate. We ended the first quarter of 2020 with assets under management in equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes $709.5 billion, a decline of $225 billion from the fourth quarter of 2019. However, it is important to note that more than 96% of this sequential decrease was driven by market declines and only 4% of the decrease was driven by cash outflows. The impact is most severe in international markets, notably in the last part of March. In the last few weeks, we have seen what appears to be a potential initial recovery in AUM levels across all equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. As of Thursday, April 23, these assets under management had increased to approximately $744 billion. In asset-based fees, we grew quarterly revenue nearly 23% from the prior year. Because we saw record AUM levels earlier in the quarter, even with the downward trend in March we were able to drive higher asset-based fees from equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. As Baer noted, we were excited to see record quarterly volumes in futures and options linked to MSCI indexes, which grew approximately 54% to more than 40 million contracts. This helped to more than double our asset-based fee revenue from futures and options linked to our indexes, which was approximately $11 million for the quarter. Sequentially, the average basis point fee on equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes decreased by 0.11 basis points. This decline reflected a continued mix shift into funds with lower total expense ratios in line with our expectations. It also included among other items the most significant phase of the implementation of our contract renewal with BlackRock. Looking at our quarter end exposures by geography across ETF assets under management linked to MSCI indexes. As I noted earlier, we observed more severe market declines in emerging markets and developed markets outside the U.S. This happened to mid turbulent markets triggered by the pandemic as well as volatility in oil prices compared to the greater resiliency we saw in U.S. exposures. With regard to the year-over-year drivers of our adjusted earnings per share growth approximately 80% of our $0.35 adjusted earnings per share increase came from growth in our business. The balance was largely the impact of our lower adjusted tax rate. And now, I'll turn to our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.1 billion. In February, you'll recall that we issued $400 million of notes, due 2030 at a coupon of 3.625% and used $300 million of the proceeds to refinance our remaining outstanding 2024 notes that had a coupon of 5.25%. As of the end of the first quarter, our gross debt to latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.6 times, while our net debt to latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.4 times. You may also notice in our 10-Q filing that, we drew on our revolver in the quarter. We borrowed approximately $5 million and then repaid it in April solely as a part of our business continuity testing. We have a strong capital position that affords us the opportunity to continue to both invest selectively and strategically in our businesses and to return capital to our shareholders. As Henry noted, since the beginning of the year and through April 24, we've returned approximately $416 million of capital through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Now, I'll review our current outlook for the full year 2020, including select guidance metrics, we have revised based on our best view of the environment as of today. For the full year 2020, we now expect adjusted EBITDA expenses in the range of $700 million to $750 million versus our prior guidance of $750 million to $770 million, capital expenditures in the range of $50 million to $60 million versus our prior guidance of $60 million to $70 million, and free cash flow in the range of $540 million to $600 million versus our prior guidance of $580 million to $640 million. A full list of our guidance is included in our earnings release published this morning, as well as in our earnings presentation for this call. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at msci.com. It's important to emphasize that these numbers reflect our best estimates at this time. As we gain additional information and experience, we will be able to further assess the implications of the pandemic and its impact on global economies, our clients and our business. And finally our updated guidance reflects a thorough review of our downturn playbook, as we continue to closely monitor the operating environment. As both Henry and Baer referenced earlier, we remain highly thoughtful regarding both headcount-related spending and non-compensation expenditures with a focus on our most critical areas to support the long-term franchise. We have identified up to $50 million of adjusted EBITDA expenses we can cut if needed. In fact, we have already taken certain proactive actions. As Henry said, we have a hiring freeze in place and only a very few headcount additions are being made for critical areas. And as we have noted previously, bonuses could also adjust depending on economic conditions. We have significantly reduced discretionary spending, such as travel, entertainment and marketing and expect that this spending generally will not return in the near-term. And while we continue to continuously innovate, as Baer noted, we are spending investment dollars much more cautiously with various initiatives seeing changes to the timing, cadence and/or amount of spend we will commit. And the same is true of capital expenditures. Despite these actions, I nonetheless share Henry and Baer's confidence in our business. In fact, I would like to close by pointing back to our long-term targets that we shared with you last year at Investor Day. As Henry said earlier, we continue to believe that these trends and drivers will support our business and propel our team's execution of these targets. And with that operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. The line is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter and glad to hear that you're all safe. Just wanted to ask about, if you could give us some color on what you're seeing in April in terms of new sales on the ESG front. Just wondering if the new sales pipeline has been building more slowly in the period of market volatility or if it's held up really well? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Hi, Toni. Baer here. So look, we really haven't seen a dramatic change. Across the board, we've seen in all products a little bit of slowness, particularly in the procurement process. I think you would expect that in the current environment that people need to go an extra step to get signatures, et cetera. And that's we're seeing in different degrees and it's not a very clear pattern. But ESG certainly has held up well. So I would say that the simplest headline would be we've really seen no dramatic change in ESG and continued high levels of activity with clients moving in the right direction.
Toni Kaplan: That's great. And then for my follow-up, just trying to think about long-term impacts on the business in the aftermath of COVID-19. Would you expect anything to just meaningfully change in terms of industry trends or any strategic changes within your company just as you think about all that's gone on with the current situation?
Henry Fernandez: So, Toni I think the – we see no significant long-term changes, at least no negative changes to the franchise and to the way we interface with clients and the drivers and trends underpinning our business. If anything it – if anything over the last 25 years or so, Baer and I have been working together for over 20 years, in each one of these circumstances where we have had at this location or a crisis, we have been able to stay very close to our clients, to innovate faster, to come up with products much faster. And every time our franchise has come out stronger as a result of the crisis. So I would anticipate that that will be the case here, in which we will come out stronger. And particularly because pretty much every one of our product lines have the win in their back from sustainable investing, to factor investing, to risk management and risk analytics, particularly in a volatile environment like this to passive investing, to private equity and private asset class investing and so on and so forth. And obviously, as you know well, the underpinnings of our business are also predicated on three things: data, huge amounts of data; lot of analytics, one form or another; and an incredible amount of technology. So as clients work even more remotely and don't rely on a lot of interpersonal issues therefore we should see an uptick on a lot of what we do with our clients.
Toni Kaplan: Sure of it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey, hello, everyone. Just wanted to come back to the updated guidance for this year. So you've taken your expense guidance down, and you've also taken your cash flow guidance down more. At the same time, all your comments here sound pretty positive still in terms of retention and resilience, et cetera. So I guess my question is, are you just lowering your expectations for the asset base side that you can obviously observe and can change real time? Or are you building in any sort of reduction in subscription revenues? And if so, what are the areas that you're I guess the most negative near term? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: No, I think -- look, I think clearly we have, as you know Alex, a business that is about 80% subscription based, which is always going to be very resilient and very sticky. It lags on the way down as well as it lags on the way up. And 20% of the business that is largely asset-based fee, although as we have been mentioning a part of the asset-based fees is transaction based, which is the futures, and options part, which we intend at some point in the future to start breaking out so that people can see the difference between those two areas. So we -- what we're reacting right now is largely to the decline of assets under management fees on ETF and other forms of passive in order to protect profitability. That can definitely be flexed up if the markets continue to do well as they have so far during April. So -- but in environments like this, it doesn't pay to be heroic. It pays to be cautious. It pays to make sure that you're sober. We don't know how the world will come out, out of this crisis, particularly in economic terms how the various economies around the world will come out. We've been pleasantly surprised by the evaluation in equity markets relative to the state of the global economy and we hope that that continues. But if it doesn't continue and we'll see another down draft on that we have to be prepared to tighten the belt. One other thing that we're also doing is in addition to that, we are looking at reallocating resources from projects that were very important before the crisis to projects that are more important now, and that would allow us to continue to invest and innovate. The last thing that I will say and Baer will -- can go through that in more detail is, crisis like this are exercises of throwing out the weak hands, right? So therefore, we need to be cognizant that at MSCI we're also focused on intensely on efficiency and productivity, because crisis like this force you to do that. And that should also create savings for us to invest more. But, Linda anything else that you want to add to Alex question?
Linda Huber: Sure. Alex, let me just walk through what we're seeing with ABF. And you're right that cash flows move more -- free cash flows move down more than cost cut. So let me just take you a little bit through that. As Henry said, 80% subscription revenue business, but then we've got to think about ABF, which is about 20% of the total revenue. So the run rate for ABF as of March 31 was $350 million. So if you think about it in three buckets, roughly $200 million is from ETFs, another $100 million or so is non-ETF passive. And remember that's reported on a one quarter lag, very sticky, doesn't move too much. And the remaining, somewhat less than $50 million comes from futures and options. So, what's happening with each of those on the ETF run rate, we saw this $225 billion decline and that was almost entirely driven by market depreciation, I commented on that in the script 96% from market depreciation. Non-ETF passives, as we said, is pretty stable, few outflows quarter lag reporting. So, that one hangs in there. And then futures and options are able to make up some of the decline that we've seen from the ABF run rate that we talked about before, but not all of it. And we think that that will continue to pickup. So, we've got kind of one chunk that's down which is asset-based fees. Passives hang in there. Futures and options doing really well. Now on top of that you've to lay in a couple of cash flow factors. So last year coming off of 2019, we had very significant stock-based compensation, which vested. We don't have that this year. And we have taken into account. We may see some slowdown in collection. So as part of Henry's comment on conservative planning, we thought about slowing that down a little bit, which also would hit our cash flow. However, we're working very hard to make sure that we keep our day sales in line with what it's been. So, it's mainly just conservative planning and hope that helps you.
Alex Kramm: Yes. No, that's great. Thank you. And maybe just a very quick one, just so I make sure I heard you right. On the basis point side, on the ABF fees, on the ETF fees, you said that BlackRock renegotiation is now fully in the run rate. So, basically, now -- all else equal, basically is the point then are there any more step downs that we should be thinking about, as you maybe change some of the contracts around floors, et cetera? Or is it all there now?
Linda Huber: Sure, and Baer may want to comment on this after me. Of course, Alex, we're not going to go deeply into this. But I think we said on the script that the biggest chunk of that reset has now passed behind us and that will have some impact as we go forward. But as we said that's the biggest piece. Baer, may wish to add.
Baer Pettit: No, I have nothing to add. I think that's pretty clear.
Alex Kramm: All right. Thank you again.
Linda Huber: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Baer, your opening remarks around feedback from your clients. Could you just remind us what the customer mix is by those clients? And if -- I don't know if I missed this, but from core asset management base, I don't think you addressed what you're hearing there.
Baer Pettit: Sure. Okay. So we can give you the exact breakdown. But, clearly, with rounding error, asset managers are our largest segment, I think we're at roughly 60%-ish at this stage. But more broadly, across the board, we've had, I think, really an excellent client response. We've been reaching out very broadly. I sent an e-mail to all the clients and we laid out a range of free trials on a number of products, which have had a very high uptick across all product lines and regions. Our research readership is I think up something like 70% over the 24-month average. We've been putting out a lot of very topical research related to market reactions, stress testing, et cetera. We've given clients enormous amounts of support related to working remotely. And, of course, even before that, as a starting point, we've shown great resiliency in all of our deliverables to clients. So, I would say that, in terms of the levels of client engagement, the outstanding job that our client coverage teams have done working remotely and reaching out to clients, continuing to do demos of our software products, etcetera, has been great. At this stage, in view of the fact that we're really only a month into the quarter, it's very hard to draw conclusions much beyond the ones that Henry laid out a bit earlier, which is, for sure the sales cycle has got a bit slower. We are seeing certain things being pushed out a bit. We are seeing things being pushed a little bit more senior in organizations to get approval. And the likelihood is that will continue. And our expectation is, although, just to be clear, we haven't seen a great deal of evidence of this, but our expectation is likely that it would be logical that if the economic consequences of the pandemic are those that we're reading about every day, that we will likely see some pressure from cancellations as certain clients come under strain. So, I would say, great client engagement, the pipeline is still healthy and the sort of marginal tensions that you would expect at this stage, without anything dramatic or anything, that's a clear pattern.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And just somewhat tied to this question, just a philosophical question. Like, how flexible are you guys willing to be, I'm not sure of the analogy to draw from 2008, 2009? Because this customer base presumably maybe feel as an impact at the lag. So once we get there, does your philosophy around pricing and working with them giving them concessions, et cetera, does that change at all?
Baer Pettit: Yes. Look, we're not in a position at this stage to need to seriously consider sort of structural adjustments. The first stage that we've done is just to make things easier, right? So, for example, giving free trials, that's not out of economic pressure. That's in order to make things easier for our clients to make sure that they have access to the right tools immediately, such as our shorter-dated models. So, I think, we will see, as things progress, most of our clients -- in fact almost all of our clients have been in lockdown, as we have and you've been. We've had to a degree, after the initial trough, some resilience in the equity markets and some support in the fixed income markets from various governments. So we're in this situation now where I think it would be difficult to speculate as to what will happen going forward. But the simplest answer to your question is, as of today we have no -- we've not seen any fundamental changes in the way we operate our pricing or anything of that kind.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Shutler with William Blair.
Chris Shutler: Everyone, good morning. You mentioned the outperformance of ESG indexes so far this year. I'm curious to what extent your team has parsed the data to understand how much of that -- like just the underlying factors driving that outperformance wondering how much of it is the ESG factors, specifically versus like quality growth and other types of factors?
Baer Pettit: Yes. So I hope you don't get me in too much of a quantitative finance trap here as we have many experts in the building. But -- so look the way I would understand it is for sure -- and this is on a high level. I'm sure you appreciate that and we'll be happy to send you all the relevant research. But the way I would say it is, I think there are two things, right? One is likely the structural trend of -- the larger amounts of capital are tilting toward ESG strategies and so there's likely -- there's an element of simply more money following companies that have a better ESG rating. In terms of some of the factor analysis we've done, there is clearly a link to quality to a degree in some of those analytics. But -- and in certain cases with certain companies, surprisingly there's actually sometimes been a link to momentum. So I think it's been -- it's not the right place or time to give an exact parsing of that. But I think the main headlines are continued resilience of people wanting exposure to the companies -- the ESG companies that they believe will drive longer-term returns. And as I said, we're happy to give you a lot of other research and data around that.
Chris Shutler: Okay. Thanks.
Linda Huber: Yes. It's Linda. Just a quick update on that. ESG, ETFs linked to MSCI saw cash inflows across all geographic exposures and factors other than X value and growth saw inflows in all regions, but emerging markets. And interestingly from a market share perspective, MSCI-linked ETFs drove 81% of global ESG, ETF flows and 165% of global factor ETF flows. Again that's X value and growth. I hope that helps you a bit.
Baer Pettit: And one final point. Look just leaving aside the performance, which again those -- there may be those better equipped to do the full breakdown. But look the -- going back to the earlier question about the ESG pipeline, certainly we are seeing very much clear and intense client focus on this. Even in the last few weeks I've been on two senior client calls, one with a large asset manager linked to an insurance company, one with a large asset owner -- a North American large asset owner. And for sure, the ESG conversation remains very front and center and we see no evidence of that changing at all.
Chris Shutler: Okay. Thanks for all the color. One more and I certainly appreciate it's super early days. But any anecdotal evidence from your conversations with clients around the kind of active passive allocations whether that may shift a little bit based on your conversations?
Baer Pettit: Look I think the simplest answer is, no. I just don't think. No, but I really -- I think with the relatively short amount of time frame and the volatility of markets for sure, we've seen -- we haven't seen or heard anything that I'd like to -- I'd feel comfortable extrapolating from.
Chris Shutler: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So first question for you. I wanted to ask for a little color on the – basically, how you're able to retain such a high level of the AUM? Meaning that, in a $225 billion downtick, only 4% of that could be explained by the asset outflows. That seems like very sticky. And I think ESG could probably explain some of that, but I just wanted to get your color on that?
Henry Fernandez: So Bill, I think the -- what you have here is that two, three different trends. The first one is in general, we have seen in periods of significant market volatility and decline that investors who want to remain equitized and not simply sort of go to cash prefer to put their money into indexed strategies. So that in and of itself supports the -- has always supported the market for ETF. And for sure there is no withdrawals in -- of any significant magnitude from institutional passive management. Secondly with respect to MSCI, there are -- there is a mix going on that I would like to allude to. There is a shift towards factor investing and we benefited from that. There's a shift towards ESG investing. We've benefited from that. Our U.S. -- our MSCI USA indices license to ETFs in the U.S. such as the USA Minimum Volatility Index for example has gathered assets. And as you know in this period of volatility in the world there's been money flock into the U.S. markets. So we have been a beneficiary of that. Not to some extent that others, because obviously we do have a large exposure in emerging market, which is -- has been a negative and in other developed markets around the world. But for sure as we have developed more and more MSCI USA indices and license them to ETF managers that has allowed more assets to flow into that compared to the past. So those are a few examples of why we believe we have outperformed relative to other index providers and relative to our clients who are ETF managers have outperformed relative to other ETF managers.
Bill Warmington: Well, for my follow-up question. You had mentioned hedge fund outflows and I noticed on the retention rate for the end of Q1, they look fine. But should we be bracing ourselves for a tick down in the retention rates for the end of Q2?
Henry Fernandez: Not really. I think that -- I'd like to reinforce what Baer said, which is we were very pleased with the last week or so of the quarter, the last week of March -- the last two weeks of March even in the midst of huge amount of volatility in the markets, major scare and fear and uncertainty as to what will happen. And a meaningful amount of our sales in the quarter end up being the last week or two of the quarter. And we were able to close the vast majority of those. A few slip towards the following quarter, which is a normal cadence that happens. Sometimes you cannot get all the approvals so the sales slips to the next quarter. And in the month of April so far, we are clearly bracing ourselves to lower sales and higher cancels and elongated sales cycles and the like. But as Baer indicated, we have not seen significant evidence of that yet. Again we are bracing ourselves and we want to talk to all of you openly about that, and it is something that we want to prepare for but we have not seen yet significant evidence of that one.
Bill Warmington: Got it. All right. Well, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Craig Huber: Thank you. Your cost guidance, you obviously brought it down by $50 million Linda at the low end of your range there. Can you just sort of think -- help us think about that for the two major segments? Is it broken down 50/50 between indexes, analytics? And I'll have a follow-up.
Linda Huber: Sure. Craig, probably the first thing to focus on is we want to reiterate we said up to $50 million. And it is our fond hope that we won't have to cut that deeply. The actual amount depends on what we do and when. If the crisis gets worse, we can toggle more toward that $50 million and if not that may be too much. Some of the flexibility is already embedded in our process. You've seen our downturn playbook. The first bucket is the self-adjusting metrics-based incentive plans. So, obviously, if we don't do as well, we don't pay out as much. So that happens automatically. We do have the majority of the expenses with the people. And so a meaningful amount of it is compensation. You heard we have a hiring freeze in place. That's across the board and it doesn't relate to any of the businesses specifically. So just making a very few critical hires. And again the bonuses could adjust based on the economic conditions. Then we have some discretionary spending that we also talk about in the downturn playbook. So T&E has largely frozen at this point. Training, professional fees, marketing those kinds of things we can limit pretty quickly and that has allowed us to pull it on our cost base. So again if things are really difficult, we can go back to having expenses being flat to last year. And if not, we will continue with less of an expense cut. But it's not really broken out specifically by businesses. We do intend to continue to invest at this moment. We're holding on to a very high percentage of our investment dollars at this point. And we're going to have to see how things go through the rest of the year. But as Henry stresses all the time, we have to be prepared. So we are prepared and we will see how conditions move. But $50 million is the outside if things are quite difficult. So I hope that helps you.
Henry Fernandez: What I'd like to add to Linda's comment is that we at the moment do not necessarily have a bearish view of our environment the same way that we don't necessarily have a bullish view on the environment. What we are doing at MSCI and we always have done is to ensure that we are prepared to flex up or flex down. Flex up meaning if the AUM recovers, we will be back at putting some of the investment spending that we have talked about, which are going to benefit us in the longer-term. If things get more difficult, we will tighten the belt. And even in those scenarios of difficult market conditions, we're still doing a meaningful amount of investing particularly in short-term return projects that will benefit us. And will come out of this crisis much better. The last thing that, I will say is there should not be any interpretation to anything that we have said that MSCI is not prepared to continue to innovate and invest in our business. We will be doing that even during this crisis. It's just the manner in which we do it, is what is relevant.
Craig Huber: My final question is your derivatives or your futures and options business is obviously quite a bit smaller than one of your major competitors out there. Just -- if you could just touch on some of the innovation some of the work you're doing there to help drive this going forward please. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: So, definitely a lot of innovation happening. A lot of new product development occurring, a lot of discussions with our partners around the world. We -- a lot of our partners in the West Europe and the U.S. is ICE and Eurex. And we've had a number of discussions with them about what new products to launch. So for example there's been a big emphasis in both ICE and Eurex to launch ESG Index futures. So we're working on that. We're also ramping up our discussion with our partners in Asia, in terms of optimizing the MSCI franchise, in Asia. Right now a big part of what we do there has been futures and options on Taiwan and Singapore another single country. We're pushing pretty hard on the futures contracts on the Emerging Markets Asia Index and the like so quite a lot of activity on this front for sure. And we see it as -- in particular in this environment, as a great time to be able to push all of that further in order to continue to diversify our revenue base.
Craig Huber: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Henry Chien with BMO. Please go ahead.
Henry Chien: Thanks. Hey everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask broadly. Obviously, we had a big market volatility reaction, but in the event that this is more like an economic recessionary type environment this year, understanding the downturn playbook and longer sales cycles. How do you think about that, like an economic recessionary impact on the asset management industry and your clients, given like MSCI history in the prior downturn. And also given the fact that passive is a lot higher percentage of the asset management industry? I'm just -- love to kind of hear your thoughts there. Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: I think what you have is a tug of two variables that typically happens, in downturns like this. On one hand, pretty much all of our products in a market -- in a down market, become more important much more essential to the success of our clients. For sure risk management -- risk analytics risk management of whether its multi-asset class portfolio fixed income portfolios, equity portfolios for sure factor investing, because they need to understand that. We talked a lot about in this crisis the outperformance of ESG. So that's going to become more important and passive. On one hand, yes, in an environment like this active stock picking benefits, but there's a huge amount of money that gets cash equitized, in passive investing. So, the passive gets a benefit. So that's -- the underlying trends behind our business become much more important in an environment like this. On the flip side, there currently is, the budgets of our clients. And how much can they make room in their budget for those absolutely essential tools that they need to add to what they have. And that's where the art comes in. We try to be more flexible. We try to figure out easier ways for them to do business with us, et cetera. So, as I think there what happens -- and in the end it's a little bit of as I said a tug between those two variables. And there are times in which the positives outweigh the negatives and there are times in which the negatives outweigh the positive. But there's never a big downturn in all of this. Now the last point on respect to passive, obviously compared to the financial crisis, our dependence on passive investing is more -- is probably double or triple -- probably triple what it was at the time of the financial crisis. But we're also very confident that even in markets like this of a crisis the equity markets will remain resilient. Why? There is financial repression. The alternative of investing in bonds is very low compared to risk assets. So, we remain fairly confident on our ability to recapture some of those fees in terms of assets under management fees in quarters to come even in the context of a recessionary environment.
Henry Chien: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question today will come from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Keith Housum: Good morning, guys. First question is can you guys remind us how much of your solutions can be done remotely with the work-at-home e-access then going on now? Is it possible to implement all of your solutions when you're not at a customer site?
Baer Pettit: Yeah. Almost entirely is what is the answer, right? So we have – our products are typically no longer locally installed at our clients bar some extremely very small percentages, which are really not worth going into. So our clients have been able to continue to access all of our content, data, analytics et cetera continuously throughout the crisis, right? So I think it's been both a very strong operational outcome in terms of the – our business continuity planning and the fact that we have been able to move everyone out of our own offices and continue producing and launching new software versions and correcting bugs and doing all the day-to-day stuff. And equally, our clients have been able to move to their home locations and continue to do everything that they normally do. So in that regard, we're pretty well set up for – should this type of environment continue we feel very confident that we can continue to operate as we normally would do.
Keith Housum: Okay. And then just as a follow-up. Obviously, the environment has changed quite a bit over the past few months. You guys got a great balance sheet. Has your appetite for M&A changed as a result of what's currently happening? And does it become any easier or harder to get it done?
Henry Fernandez: So in an environment like this, we keep – we stay very close to the companies that are of a strategic interest to us. We remain and become even more financially disciplined in valuation – in values and valuation in an environment like this. And they are – as time goes by, opportunities do present themselves in situations like this. And we will be definitely analyzing them and if they meet our criteria of significant strategic value to us and appropriate rates of return and in this case even enhanced rates of return given the risk premium that is happening around the world, we will definitely pursue them. That's – we are a little more keen on following those M&A opportunities than we were six months or a year ago, but it's totally random, right? It's whatever happens become available that we can action – turn it into action.
Keith Housum: Great. Thank you.
Andy Wiechmann: Keith. It's Andy Wiechmann. Just to add a little bit more color. Typically, what you see in a crisis environment like this is normal processes of healthy companies get put on hold. So, sellers don't have to sell. They usually don't want to process when there's uncertainty around the outcome, knowing that buyers tend to be very hesitant and bake that into their valuation expectations. So as a result what we're seeing right now is much more of those sellers that have to sell. So in our space, in our environment those tend to be early stage start-ups that are cash flow negative and really dependent on their next capital raise. We're much more open to transacting. And as Henry said, we're very active looking at these engaging with these companies. They tend to be relatively niche and have a large cost base, which are the drawback. But we are staying very close to them to the event -- to the extent there is an opportunity for us to take advantage as Henry said.
Keith Housum: Great. Thanks, Andy.
Linda Huber: It's Linda. I thought, Andy might want to just take a minute to update on the Burgiss investment that we made. And as a matter of housekeeping, I just wanted to remind everyone on the call that we're using the equity method of accounting for Burgiss. So you won't see any revenues from Burgiss this quarter because it's recorded on a one quarter lag. That the impact of the investment will show up in other expense and income net if you're looking for it. And just thought that Andy might want to comment on how Burgiss is going.
Andy Wiechmann: Sure. Sure. Thanks, Linda. So just from an overall business performance standpoint, I would highlight that they're generally pretty stable. Their business is almost entirely subscription revenue. They like MSCI are providing mission-critical content services to their clients. And the largest portion of their client base is LPs or asset owners as we would call them which are by their nature relatively stable in these environments. And they are acutely focused on trying to understand what their exposures are in all the funds they have invested in what -- where they might have risk trying to understand when the funds they've invested in might call capital and then trying to understand when those funds might distribute cash. And so Burgiss is helping those clients with all those mission-critical areas that are that much more important in an environment like this. So they're in reasonably good shape. Just to underscore what Linda said from a financial reporting standpoint, two points to underscore here; one is that because their closing cycle is a little longer than ours, we are choosing to recognize our share of their earnings on a one quarter lag. And so in the first quarter we did not record any earnings from Burgiss. And what you will see in the second quarter is our portion of earnings for the period that we had the investment in the first quarter. As Linda highlighted that will flow through in the other income line. And then the other point to underscore just around Burgiss is that we will amortize the portion of the excess value above our share of the company's book value that's attributable to intangible assets. And so there will be some intangible amortization flowing through that other income line. It's very small. But like we do with acquisitions we will exclude that amortization expense in our net income -- excuse me, in our adjusted net income and in our adjusted EPS.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. As I'm showing no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Henry Fernandez, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Once again, thank you everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in MSCI. We sincerely hope that you and your families stay safe during this difficult pandemic and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. So operator, this concludes today's call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. We will have further instructions for you at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Salli Schwartz: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. This press release, along with our earnings presentation, which we will reference on our call and a brief fourth quarter update are available on our website, msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speaks only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to, organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find the reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 25 to 33 of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run-rate growth figures which excludes the impacts of changes on foreign currency and the impacts of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Linda Huber, our Chief Financial Officer. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before I go through my prepared remarks, I would like to give you some reflections as we enter new decade, and what we should expect from MSCI. As many of you know, I've been at the helm of MSCI almost 25 years, and I can categorically tell you that today I am more excited and more optimistic about this franchise than I have ever been. And I'm sure that is not only me, but my partners here Baer and Linda share on that optimism. Our franchise getting stronger on accelerated pace. And in terms of what we do for clients all over the world, example problems and opportunities, we help them solve when industry bodies would like to know from us and learn from us, when government officials and regulators want to learn from us, everyone wants to talk to MSCI about how we are helping to change the investment industry. Our strategic investment choices at MSCI are vastly wider and deeper than they were 10 years ago, because of the more central role that we play in the global investment industry. Our financial model is not only very resilient and diversified, but it's presenting us with significant new organic opportunities of investments with even higher rates of return on short to medium term paybacks. The reason for this is that what we do is normally built upon on top of an existing infrastructure and cost base at MSCI, and that infrastructure is more and more developed any incremental investment for new things yields and much higher incremental payoff, and therefore, an acceleration on internal rates of returns. This is clearly the case in index and ESG, for example. So we are therefore positioning ourselves to take full advantage of this dynamic, and hopefully accelerate shareholder value creation throughout this new decade. Well, with those reflections, let me now go through my prepared remarks. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong performance across our franchise with year-over-year growth of 12% in operating revenues, 16% in adjusted EBITDA, and 27% in adjusted EPS. In the fourth quarter, as it's under management and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indices, we see the record high of $934 billion. The increase of $119 billion from the third quarter was driven by both strength in the dollar markets and very healthy cash inflows into ETFs linked to MSCI indices. Since the start of the New Year, we have continued to see growth in AUM levels and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indices. At the end of last week, they exceeded $960 billion, setting a new record and come close to the $1 trillion mark. We should be great to achieve so. Notably, although inflows to global equity ETFs were lower throughout 2019 compared to 2018, MSCI actually saw a 48% increase in equity ETFs inflows linked to our indices, demonstrating the power, the diversity of our ETF investing franchise. About a year ago this time, at our Investor Day, we shared with you three pillars of our strategy. Today I'm excited to give you an update on our progress. At the time we told you we will, one, grow our core business, two, executes in-flight opportunities, and then, three, capture new wave of opportunities in order to serve a wire and deeper variety of clients investment problems and opportunities. And therefore, in turn, fuel the growth of the company and the creation of shareholder value. We have been delivering on our promise to execute in these areas of growth while serving as responsible stores of your capital. In the core business, we have produced significant growth as we continued to innovate and add content in response to changing markets and client interests. You can see evidence of this continuous progress in our well-established solutions like our equity market cap indices, our equity risk and performance analytics as well as our multi-asset class risk analytics. In fact, as of December 31, 2019, we’ve reached a combined run rate for our index analytics segments of almost $1.5 billion, up 13% year-over-year. In addition to accelerating our core business, we have executed on a number of in-flight growth opportunities to meet the needs of our customers and the investment community more broadly. Let me give you a few examples. First within our futures and options business, we expanded our strategic partnerships with key derivative exchanges in the US and Europe. The run rate from futures and options grew over 56% compared to the prior year. Second with respect to our ESG business, the October 2019 acquisition of Carbon Delta provided us an essential climate value of risk capabilities for ESG franchise. And of course, the climate change segment of ESG franchise is an area that we're intensely focused on as the world is focusing on the impact of climate change, in a variety of areas, in our case, on portfolios of our clients. So those form, we are very pleased with the progress we have made with our integration efforts Carbon Delta and the level of client interest that we've already seen. Third, in fix income, we’ve recently launched 15 MSCI fix income ESG and Factor indices leveraging our 30-plus years of extensive experience in fixed income risks and performance analytics as well as our leadership in the index construction and then state-of-the-art data capabilities, and, of course, on our expertise in ESG. Finally, in real estate, we continue to grow and expand our offering of private or real estate data and analytics, and are optimistic that our growth in this segment will gradually accelerate. Finally, we have invested in new wave opportunities that will drive our future growth. Most recently, we entered into a strategic relationship through a significant minority investment in the purchase group, a leading provider of investment decision tools for private asset classes. This was an area of significant focus in our Investor Day a year ago. Our positioning in private assets is critical to supporting our clients, we're increasingly looking for solutions that expand both public and private assets. Our alliance with Burgiss is intended to accelerate and expand use of data analytics and other investment decision support tools for investors in private asset classes all over the world. More broadly, we remain committed to providing our clients with tools that will enable them to capitalize on their significant new investment opportunities and challenges. We believe this puts MSCI at the leading edge of modern investing. As we enter the new decade, we're proud of what we have built, and the tremendous value that our employees have created for our clients, and in turn, our shareholders. Before I pass on the call to my partner Baer, I would like to congratulate him because this month Baer has celebrated his 20th anniversary of being an MSCI and a partner of mine throughout the time. Mr. Pettit?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. 20 very interesting years indeed and doubtless more excitement ahead of us. So clearly, I share your enthusiasm about the many opportunities to drive growth and shareholder value at MSCI. Henry talked about the three pillar strategy that we discussed with you at Investor Day. At that event, we also highlighted the secular forces that are transforming the investment industry, including the move from activity to index enabled investing, increasing globalization and acceleration of capital flows; and the need to incorporate ESG and more specifically, climate change considerations into investments processes. MSCI continues to be well positioned to help global investors build modern portfolios that will capitalize on this transformation. Our sales efforts have led to total organic run rate growth of more than 14% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Gross sales grew about 20% in each of our segments in the fourth quarter, and we reached record total gross sales of over $75 million. The fourth quarter's retention rate was down from the third quarter, but in-line with last year's fourth quarter rate at 92.9%. As a result of a seasonal decline, given the concentration of contracts, we generally come up for renewal in the fourth quarter. We're working hard to deliver must have products and solutions to our clients with the aim that such tools become embedded in their processes, analysis and thinking about investing. Our recurring subscription run rate where we recorded our ninth straight quarter of organic double digit percentage growth saw strength across all geographies, notably in Asia Pacific and Europe. From a client perspective, asset managers and asset owners, which collectively comprise two thirds of our subscription run rate, grew above the 11% each. At a segment level, index and analytics subscription run rate grew more than 11% and 7%, respectively. Within analytics, we recorded strong recurring sales growth in our equity and multi-asset class solutions, notably to asset owners. Within our all other segments, we crossed milestones of $100 million for our ESG research subscription run rate and $50 million for our real estate subscription run rate. Our ability to achieve these strong results and to deliver attractive returns on our investment dollars, validate our disciplined capital allocation approach. Our daily focus is to help clients more effectively and efficiently build portfolios. I'd like to walk you through a few recent examples of this. First, innovation within our ESG and factor categories has been a key differentiator in the cash inflows to equity ETFs linked to MSEI indexes versus our competitors, in 2019, MSEI was the number one index provider based on cash inflows to equity ETFs. Second, as we have often communicated, there are significant client benefits integrating MSEI research and content across various investment use cases. In the ESG space this integration has driven our combined ESG research and index run rate to nearly $150 million in 2019. Third, our continuous investments in modeling new risk categories has helped bolster our analytics growth. One such example is in the area of liquidity metrics where our innovative solutions were well received in 2019, and contributed meaningfully to our financial results. Next, our interactions with major global asset owners and asset managers show us that our real estate offerings are an important input to their investment decisions. Further, our 2019 client surveys indicate significant improvements in customer satisfaction with regards to our real estate products and services. And finally, last week we published the MSCI principles of sustainable investing to further equip investors with a framework to integrate ESG into their investment prophecies and make the global shift towards sustainable investing. Overall, we have substantial momentum heading into 2020, and we are confident in our ability to continue delivering for our clients.  This confidence underpins our guidance, which Linda will review in addition to going over our financial performance. Over to you, Linda.
Linda Huber: Thanks, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll start with operating revenue where we reported $407 million in the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. Looking at each of our business units, first, in index, operating revenue grew approximately 16%. Growth in asset based-fees was a meaningful contributor. In addition, we saw strength in recurring subsequent subscription revenue, driven by continued momentum and developed market modules and impact of custom in ESG indexes. Second, analytics operating revenue increased more than 5% with continued strong growth and nonrecurring revenue from implementation and other services as well as an uptick in recurring subscription revenue. Finally, for the all other segments, operating revenues grew 20%, reflecting reverse growth across our ESG rating and screening offers. In asset-based fee, revenue grew 18%. It was driven by strong ETF revenue and average asset under management grew 21% year-over-year, and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. Sequentially the average basis points fee actually increased slightly 5.01 basis points. This was due to the mix of ETF capturing flows rather than a reversal of the broader to context. Non-ETFs assets fund revenue was up 11%, driven by increased contributions from higher fee products. And finally, futures and options revenue, one of our high growth areas, set approximately $3 million as compared to last year. As you heard from Henry, ending assets under management and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes were $934 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 34% versus the prior year-end and up more than 14% versus the prior quarter end. On a sequential basis, MSCI up $56 billion of inflows into 5.2 MSCI indexes across geographic market exposures, notably those associated with developed markets outside the U.S. Additionally, factors in ESG funds accounted for nearly a third of cash inflows into equity ETFs linked to our indices. On year-over-year basis, around 40% of $239 billion growth in assets under management at year-end was attributable to cash inflows with the balance coming from market appreciation. Now I'll shift the focus to adjusted earnings per share, excuse me, which was $1.67 per share in the fourth quarter, up 27% year-over-year. More than two-thirds of the growth in adjusted EPS was from higher operating revenue, net of operating expenses, strong proof points on the earnings power of our franchise. The remaining third of the growth in adjusted EPS was driven primarily by a lower tax rate and reduced share count, partially offset by higher interest expense. Turning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and $31 billion of debt. Excuse me, $3.1 billion of debt. In November, we issued $1 billion of debt at a coupon of 4% and $500 million of the proceeds to partially refinance our $5.25 coupon notes due in 2024 of which we currently have $300 million remaining. In the fourth quarter MSCI paid approximately $58 million in dividends to its shareholders, but did not repurchase any shares. Before I turn the call back to Henry, I'd like to share some elements of the 2020 guidance, we published in our press release morning. MSCI trend for 2020 is based on assumptions and a number of macroeconomics, capital market factors, and particularly related to equity market. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and actual results for the year could differ materially from our current guidance. For the full year 2020, we currently expect adjusted EBITDA expenses in the range of $750 million to $770 million and capital expenditures in the range of $60 million to $70 million. As you know, we cannot predict asset base fee revenue. However, it is our intention that higher levels of operating revenues will coincide with higher levels of expenses and higher capital expenditures as we invest back in our growing businesses. Finally, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million. Free cash flow in 2020 is projected to decline from 2019, primarily due to two factors. First, the absence of tax benefits we had related to stock-based compensation last year; and second, to increase capital expenditures this year. A full list of our guidance is included in our earnings release published this morning as well as in our earnings presentation for this call. Both are available in the investor relations section of our website at msci.com. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to turn the call back over to Henry.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Linda. I’m pleased to announce that we've added two new Directors to our Board. Paula Volent and Sandy Rattray have been appointed to serve as Independent Directors effective February 26th of this year, increasing our Board from 10 to 12 directors. Both Paula and Sandy have extensive experience in the investment industry. Paula is currently the Chief Investment Officer of Bowdoin College in the U.S., one of the best performance endowments in the U.S. And Sandy is currently the Chief Investment Officer of the Man Group in the UK. I’m confident they will provide diverse and valuable perspectives, drawing from their combined global experience and their expertise across asset classes and emerging the industry trends, including technological innovation. And with that, we'll move over now to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Could you talk about the decision to make ESG ratings available for free on the website? My take was that the objective is to broaden the use of the ratings, and have MSCI continue to be the standard there. And I guess could you just talk about if that changes that ESG business model you have at all? And then finally, with a lot of new big name providers entering the ESG space, do you think there'll be more price competition in ESG? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Hi, Toni, Baer here. So look, clearly transparency is a critical element in sustainable investing. And we have shown our commitment to that both to the broader market and also to companies by making this information available at this level. Equally, central to the notion of ESG investing and sustainable investing is being able to go deep into underlying information relating to companies, activities, supply chain, and the enormous diversity of their activities. So we're confident that by putting this on our website, it both shows our commitment to transparency to giving the market headline information, but that our subscription model and the need to act as the more detailed research behind the ratings will continue to be very important economic driver for us.
Toni Kaplan: And do you think pricing will be more competitive?
Baer Pettit: At this stage, we don't have a great deal of evidence of that. I mean, as you know, it's an area of investing that is growing dramatically quickly. We've seen enormous changes even within the last year or two, let alone the last five years. And so and lows to make a forward-looking judgment about that. I think you can see our results are very robust and very -- continue to be very strong and attractive. So at present, we don't have any evidence of any sort of strong pricing pressure.
Toni Kaplan: Got it. Thanks. And for my follow-up, just wanted to get an update on beyond analytics look by this quarter. And so I wanted to understand that the number of clients adopting the platform was above of what you had expected originally. And just talk about any sort of future selling – cross-selling opportunities with that. That'd be great.
Baer Pettit: Sure. So for the time being beyond is not having a material impact on the analytics numbers. And during the course of 2020, it will not be a major contributor to the analytics sales. We're confident about where the platform is. And I think, as the year progresses, we can keep you updated on the functionality and client uptake. So I would say we're confident with the path for beyond, but from a pure accounting revenue point of view for 2020, it should not have a material impact.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Henry, just the Burgiss deal sounds pretty interesting. And I was just wondering if you could help describe in the context of all the partnerships and so forth, they've been looking at like, what is that pipeline look like? We weren't familiar with Burgiss. I'm sure there's plenty of these other ones out there, so just curious on your thoughts on what that looks like?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So Manav, let me start with Burgiss, and then we can browse it to other forms of partnerships. So Burgiss is one of the leading, if not the leading provider of private asset class, data and analytics through a sort of integrated, unified technology platform. They've been at it, at this game for about 30 years, 30 plus years. They serve about 1,000 clients in 36 countries. And importantly, on the product line is about 10,000 funds that represented by $7 trillion of committed capital. And a bit of their strength is in private equity. But it's not totally. So in that, let me give you a little breakdown, in that 10,000 funds, over 6,000 of those 10,000 are in private equity, representing about $400 trillion out of the seven. Another close to 2,000 funds, representing say about $1.5 trillion are in private real assets, real estate, natural resources infrastructure. And another thousand funds or so, representing close to a trillion dollars, little less, is in private. So this is an incredibly rich database that we can not only held Burgiss commercialize much more rapidly. And that's one of the reasons you haven't heard much about Burgiss because they've been a company that has been a great deal of time building their products and we are – a lot of our efforts are to help them commercialize product. But then secondly that we can take a lot of these databases at MSCI and build all the things that we know how to build, build risk models, build performance attribution models, performance measurement models and all of that for these various private assets. So we are extremely excited about this partnership and investment that will -- so remember, everything I just say about Burgiss, what I haven’t said is our own private core real estate product line. We just crossed the $50 million run rate is made up of about $2 trillion worth of real estate properties in 30, 40 countries in the world, and representing about 70,000 properties. So there's some overlap, so to speak, but between the tools, we have roughly $9 trillion of databases, which I would imagine is pretty close to 85%, maybe 90% or 95% of the entire universe of private asset classes in the world. So very exciting about that opportunity. Now more broadly speaking, one of the key tenets of MSCI's strategy is to build partnerships. Distribution partnerships, research, academic partnerships to build new models, data partnerships to get data, technology partnerships to help us accelerate our AI and machine learning processes, for example, and the like. And those partnerships to be the basis for creating ecosystems in which hopefully, MSCI is the heart of that ecosystem in order for all of us to be serving clients. So we started -- we've always been doing this, but we accelerated the partnership initiatives about two, three years ago. Obviously, we have very extensive client partnerships as well. But we accelerated the other forms of partnerships. So you're going to see us doing a lot more of this, a lot more. Some partnerships may be just a strategic relationship, exchanging in data, exchanging mutual capabilities. Some of them may require some investments on our part either minority investments of any type or maybe control investments.
Manav Patnaik: Okay got it. And I guess one of the reasons that we're asking that and maybe, Linda, you can help here just in terms of the capital allocation, should we just see more of these? How should we see the balance of buybacks? Because I guess, your stock is nearly doubled from the last time you guys made this average that you disclosed 147. So just curious how we should think of that going forward?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So we have an integrated capital allocation approach, right, which is “external capital location”, which is dividends, share buybacks, obviously, we're always focused on the leverage ratios of the company. And the objective there is to run the company within the minimal amount of capital necessary and distribute any excess capital in the company. And then the internal capital allocation process is about how do we deploy capital internally for organic investments that -- and that's something that Linda can talk to at a later point in time that we're very focused on. And then obviously, the third element is sort of external M&A or partnerships and the like. These are all opportunistic. They got a common goal. I will not say that we're accelerating that for any reason. It just happens with the Carbon Delta, and we've done this. But -- whatever -- and those have extremely attractive returns, obviously, in addition to the organic investments. So whatever it doesn't get utilized on a proper and high rate of return with good paybacks then that capital gets returned to the shareholders in the form of dividends and in the form of opportunistic buybacks of our shares.
Linda Huber: Manav, it's Linda. We continue to pay our dividends. It's about $58 million per quarter on our dividends. We'll take another look at our dividend rates we get later in the year as we usually do. Partnerships are very important, but they don't require a huge outlay of cash, which is very helpful. They do require a huge outlay of work and time and focus on the accounting treatment. The buybacks, we do have some modeled in about 2.2 million shares, frankly, at a price lower than where we're trading now. We'll continue to take a look at that. But that continues to focus on the opportunistic where repurchasing shares that Henry just talked about. So that's how we're thinking about this for right now. And if we evolve that over the year, we will keep you posted.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alex Kramm: Just want to ask about the guidance very briefly here. I understand, obviously, that you don't make drive revenues because of the asset-based side. But clearly, you guide operating cash flow and free cash flow. And you just made this comment Linda that there is clearly a level that if asset base is doing better, you would spend a little bit more. So can you just help us how you think about that side of that business in terms of what are you budgeting for market performance, flows, pricing perhaps? So we have a better sense of when you would accelerate the spending if markets actually work in your favor? Thanks.
Linda Huber: Okay, Alex, you're asking for about all the variables we haven't spoken to. So let me see if I can help you with this in a way that follows our guidance. So we started with the adjusted EBITDA expense because we thought this would be more helpful for the shareholders, and we talked about a range of $750 million to $770 million. The matching number for 2019 was $707 million just so you're aware of that. The piece of ETFs linked to MSCI within ADS has grown rapidly. We started the most recent number at $950 million, which has been a significant jump up from where we were just a few months ago. So we're taking a look at that $950 million number Alex. And in terms of planning for our expense growth, we're taking a moderate or conservative view of further growth in that number because it has jumped up pretty, significantly, just in the last couple of months. So hope that helps you. And then the $770 million, which is the top end of the range, we want to very much stressed that hat we're going to have to see some additional increases in those ABF fees enable to spend more. So we're looking at modest increase in spending. If we have earned it. If we have earned it on the top line, and that may take us toward the higher end of the range, but we'll keep you posted. We would note, very important to note, the first quarter is a higher expenditure quarter for us due to tax payments and bonuses. So if we do more of this, it will likely not come quite as much in the first quarter, but a little bit more tilted toward the second and third, perhaps the back half of the year. So hope that helps you, Alex, but we would point you back to the longer-term guidance targets that we had given in Investor Day last year as what we're continuing to try to achieve.
Alex Kramm: So that basically means you're not looking for a help from the market, is that point, right? Did I hear that right?
Linda Huber: We’re very thoughtful and moderate in terms of what we're expecting from the market because we've seen very good growth already.
Alex Kramm: Yeah, good. And just second quickly, I think you gave a little bit of color on analytics growth. I mean the sales was very impressive, but maybe you can expand a little bit more in terms of where that is coming from. Is it a lot of up sales? Can you maybe talk about the regions you seeing or -- customer types receive a lot of demand, I think, it would be great? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Sure. So I'll make a few comments there, Alex. So, first of all, I think we've had a generally strong growth across analytics, as I said in my comments. So it's not -- I would say unevenly distributed. Having said that, particularly positive areas have been recently in combination of borrow one for in asset owners. So for total portfolio analysis of risk and return and with a sort of if you like an overweight in the numbers to Asia. So those are some of the, I would say the most recent, above average performances. I would say -- and in those -- we would assume that the strength in total portfolio analytics will continue. The numbers in Asia were very strong. We want to keep pushing them, but they did have and may not persistent quite that level -- there were some exceptional deals there. But and as I mentioned with my comments about liquidity, that's one example of various kinds of serving, increasingly specialized use cases where we have a unique offering. So I would say good core strengths, some specific out performance and continued innovation. And we want to, keep that on.
Alex Kramm: Sounds good. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: So first question for you on the index business, you had talked to the retention rate and how that was flat year-over-year and that we saw the downtick on the sequential basis, and that was driven mostly by seasonal components. Now, it’s a high class problem, I'm not trying to pick on the 93% retention rate, because that's very strong. But I just wanted to know if there was anything behind that downtick and also a question of where are the investors going if -- when they do leave?
Baer Pettit: Yeah, so the good news, Bill, is the headline is nothing to see here. Honestly, there really isn't, I mean, the Q4 number was pretty much. So that's the total company number. The index number is higher. I don't have a right in front of me. But -- so the total, the total company number was pretty much flat. The index numbers have continued to be very strong. And so really, there's -- the good news is there's really -- there's no story that we see there. We see conditions being fundamentally what they have been.
Bill Warmington: Got it. And then a question on -- my follow-up on the analytics business, there was a slug of nonrecurring revenue there that you mentioned that came from implementation. Just wanted to know if that was a forerunner of some acceleration in the analytics business or how to interpret that?
Baer Pettit: Sure. So in fact, let me talk about nonrecurring sales a little more broadly. So last year, there was roughly a 50-50 split in nonrecurring sales between equity index and analytics. So in equity index, the main drivers of that are the continued strengthening of what Henry has called the third pillar of derivatives in equity index which is -- which are made up of structured products and OTC, over-the-counter licenses. So that is the main thing there. And those revenues are nonrecurring, but we think that category will continue to grow. In analytics, to come back to your point, the key drivers there are implementation and managed services on a roughly 2/3, 1/3 basis. So structurally in analytics, as our larger, more complex deals grow and also as we service this efficiency theme that we've discussed with you in the past at asset managers where we're getting increasingly involved in helping them manage data, etc., then the managed services linked to that in setting all of that infrastructure up, will continue to go up. The final point about those, again, it's a category which should grow but just to reemphasize what we've said in the past, it will be lumpy. It is -- there are certain types of deals which will have this attached to it. There are certain types which won't. And so it's a category, which directionally should grow, but will be fairly lumpy Q-on-Q type of thing.
Bill Warmington: Sounds like Linda has to create a new category of recurring and nonrecurring.
Baer Pettit: We'll just try to keep the money coming in.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi: Hi, I wanted to go back to ISG for a second -- I'm sorry, ESG, where's my head. But it's been a lot of wording, I guess. But yes, if you know anything about ISG, I'll take that, too. But on the ESG side, maybe you could just take a step back and frame for us what -- how you see that evolving? It's obviously a red hot space. What products do you think are going to move in the short term, how you're going to price them? And then how you think about competition in that space right now? And where you see it going?
Henry Fernandez: So look, the ESG investing or sustainable investing is a major permanent secular trend in the world driven by -- think of it as the shrinking of the basement, the shrinking of the world in terms of dissemination of information, connectivity, communication, transparency of what's happening and the like. And that this -- in a world like that, in which societies around the world, are -- have access to a lot more information, a lot more transparency on a real-time basis about what's happening in all institutions of society. Those societies are going to hold those institutions accountable for their actions. And this is not just about investors and companies. It's about political institutions, media, religious, educational and so on and so forth. So 10 years from now, in the investing industry, I don't think that there will be a category called sustainable investing because everything that people will do will have to have an element of sustainable investing in that -- in their investment processes. So MSCI wants to be the leading provider by far in the world of all the tools necessary to make that transition and to get to that point, and that is from ESG research, to understand what the ESG components of companies are. So somebody wants to come with a list and say, exclude this, exclude that, we know what we're talking about, ESG ratings, ESG indices of all types in equities, in fixed income and the like. By the way, ESG ratings in equities, in fixed income, in real estate, in private companies, in private debt and the like. And ESG risk models or less risk models that take into account also ESG in all the other factors that they do and all of that. So we are extremely well positioned at MSCI to be the leader in this, because we already are crossing the whole product range that I just described. We are already a multi-asset class firm, and we already play a central role in the investment industry. So there will be competition because it's a very vast and large field for sure. But I think our position in the marketplace, our -- the quality of what we do, the combination of all the things that we do for people, as opposed to only one thing to one area or another that another supplier can do, will create enormous moat around our franchise. And that's what we're gunning for here, and that's where we're putting enormous investments into that. Now that's the ESG category as a whole. Within ESG, you have climate change, which is eventually, maybe in next few years, climate change and the impact on portfolios around the world, may even become bigger than ESG itself. Right now, we put it into a subset of ESG investing, but they may become even bigger than ESG investing itself and a category of its own. So we're taking steps to be the leading provider of climate change tools in the world as they affect portfolios, as they affect repricing of assets and as they affect asset allocation of investors. 
Joseph Foresi: Got it. And then on the fixed income indexing. Over the last couple of years, we've heard different data points of how under-penetrated it is and what the opportunity is out there. Can you talk about what the barriers to entry are from a penetration standpoint? Is this now a real viable product that you think is going to equal that of equities over a long period of time? And how do you go about converting people on the indexing side from a fixed income perspective?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So let me just take this opportunity to say something that we say a lot inside MSCI. We're not in the index business. We're not in the analytics business. We're not in the risk business. We're not in the data business. We are in the business of helping portfolio -- helping investors build better portfolios, which right now happens to be a combination of all of that and will continue to be a combination of all of that, but there will be some other elements over time like private asset classes, that will be integral part of helping investors build better portfolios. So we have no interest in sort of launching a fixed income index for the sake of throwing another widget in the marketplace. What we are looking here to do is to -- we see a need for fixed income investors in the world, to look at an index or a model portfolio, if you think that way, that incorporates the securities in it, reweighted along ESG lines or reweighted along factor lines. And if ESG right now is less of an alpha-generating tool, a lot of it is a risk management tool. And if we think that ESG is big in equities, it should be much bigger in fixed income. Because as you know, when you invest in a fixed income means the best you can hope for is get paid back your principal. And therefore, risk management becomes much more central to the investment process of fixed income, and therefore, ESG should become more central to that process. So that's what we're solving for in the launch of these things. And we did it in consultation with clients all over the world, and use cases that we want to use and all of that.
Baer Pettit: And just one -- just more slightly tactical observation -- following up from Henry's kind of slightly more strategic view, we've been talking to clients in the last number of weeks since these indexes have been launched and leading up to their launch. We've had very positive feedback across a range of different client types. And so I would say that from our client interactions, very recently, literally last week, the last few weeks, we've had a very positive reception. These numbers will not be material to MSCI in the short run. But I hope that over the course of the year, we'll be able to give you more color related to benchmark wins, product launches related to these indexes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research.
Craig Huber: Thank you. A couple of questions. The 6% to 9% guidance, I guess, for cost for this new year of EBITDA expenses. Can you just quickly highlight for me where the incremental spend is going toward in terms of what growth initiatives internally? You've touched a lot of -- a bunch of it but for me just rank, order, the top three or four with this incremental dollars are going toward? That's my first question.
Linda Huber: Sure, Craig. The first thing is that technology underpins all of our investments. And we pair those technology investments with the product investments to ensure that we can deliver for our clients. Some of the product investment areas are ESG, as Henry has described at length. Fixed income, where things are going very well. Index innovation is also a very good area for us. And futures and options is growing very rapidly. Also, our Analytics business is doing really well. Margin, close to 35%, which is an incredible accomplishment. So plenty of areas for investment and those would be some of the major ones. But again, only toward the high end of the expense growth range, if we earn our way into it with good fortunes in the ABF lot.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. Look, I think, importantly, that flexing between 6% and 9%, we obviously, accounting-wise call it EBITDA expenses. These are not -- I mean, there are expenses, of course, but they are investments, more importantly. And we are also extremely focused and obsessed with a methodology or investment, which we call the triple crown methodology, which is something that we want to buy us, a lot of our investments and our internal capital allocation, on investments of three crowns. One is high, very high risk-adjusted internal rates of return. Secondly, the shorter the payback, the better. And number three, in areas that the multiple of EBITDA that is yielded by those investment is the highest. So there will be a balance. Obviously, that you've got to do in all of this, but the huge emphasis is in that triple crown territory.
Craig Huber: And my next question, guys, can you give us the annual run rate, if you would, for each of ESG at the end of the year, the future and options segment and then fixed income? Do you have those three numbers handy?
Henry Fernandez: Seems like we do.
Linda Huber: We do not have that handy. I'm sure you probably can look at the slides and give a view on that, Craig, as we're looking for it, anything else?
Craig Huber: The $1.5 billion or so of cash that you have on the balance sheet, I know you touched on this earlier, but the appetite for a sizable acquisition, given all your internal growth initiatives you've enunciated here last hour, I assume it's fairly low for a large acquisition? Is that a fair statement?
Linda Huber: Yes, I think that's probably fair, Craig. We like where we are. We do have an amount of dry powder. But as you see, we're moving in the partnership way of investing that has served us very well. And I think you're in the right ZIP code. One housekeeping matter while we continue to look for some things here, on the Burgiss partnership, want to reiterate that, that is a minority stake, and we will not consolidate the financials of Burgiss. Our share of its income is going to flow to other income, other expense and will be expressed in a net line on that. So just wanted to make sure that as you're looking at where we are with Burgiss, you know where to look.
Henry Fernandez: So it'll probably be best, Craig, if Salli follows up with you off-line on your question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Henry Chien with BMO.
Henry Chien: Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the core index business. I guess, beyond or not beyond but separate from the more dynamic ESG and in factors just on the index. Pretty simple question. What's driving that stable kind of 10%, 11% growth? And that data just kind of given that the flows in the active side are pretty much 0, I guess. And so I'm just kind of curious if you could frame whether that's like, just continual like TAM available in like asset owners or wealth managers or replacing providers or just adding new products? Just kind of just a pretty simple question of what's driving that growth?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So therefore, I mean, when you look at index, we haven't completely sort of broken all out like this way, and maybe we will in the future. But the -- if you look at the index product line, you can then categorize that index product line into three or four buckets, right? You can say the market cap indices -- that's what we call the ACWI IMI family. Then the ESG indices, obviously, which are -- have an ESG overlay. The factor indices, they have an overlay. And then you split the products into the use cases, which is, is it being used for active management purposes, i.e., benchmarking? Is it being used for passive management purposes? Or is it being used for derivatives or structured products as a third pillar, third leg? So it's a little bit of a matrix in all of that. So -- but if you focus on the market cap indices, and then, obviously, there is a further breakdown of market cap, the developed market cap and the emerging market cap because those modules and the subscriptions have different sales cycles. In the market cap indices, what's driving the growth is continued globalization of the equity markets of the world, continued expansion of the use cases inside an organization. So we have traditionally charged by number of people that use the indices, by vendors and all of that. We're now moving to a little bit more of a bundled products. But when you have -- if an organization has, let's say, 100 professionals that were using the indices and they want to go to 300 -- 200 or 300 professionals that want to use the indices, there has to be a commensurate amount of new fees. What is also driving the growth of the market cap businesses is custom indices? These are market cap businesses in which somebody say, can you exclude this? Can you exclude that? Can you put another thing like this? Can you do this? So that is a high level of growth that is happening that is happening there. Now in the ETF category, of course, market cap indices continue to grow as well. Obviously, the -- we've seen higher growth in ESG indices and ETF and obviously, in factor ETF. So there is a whole category of things that maybe in future discussions, we can try to put a sort of a landscape of all of this, but that's a little -- another area that obviously is happening is new client segments, right, that are new -- wealth management is a new client segment that are using now indices, hedge funds, equity long-short hedge funds are being measured given the performance of equity long-short hedge funds or lack of performance, as you say, relative to nonleverage -- I'm sorry, nonshort strategies. These people are now being increasingly measured against the market cap indices. So they need to subscribe to the information and so on and so forth.
Henry Chien: Got it. That makes sense. And so just a follow-up on, I guess, specifically the ES&G data. So it's a lot of good color on framing MSCI's role in this. I guess, just to help us understand. So in the market cap or traditional investment products, it's very much performance-driven, I guess, or measurement of return attribution. How do you think about, with ESG, given the, I guess, very question of measurement of impact or ESG risk is sort of unclear?
Henry Fernandez: Well, no, over time, I mean, over time, if you have an ESG portfolio, you're going to do all the things that you do in a normal portfolio. You're going to say, how do I measure performance? What is the attribution of the -- let me give you an example on ESG, climate change driven, which is as we all know very well, at the energy sector, particularly oil and gas has been underperformer. So when you do your performance measure and attribution, you have to say, what parts of the oil and gas industry are driving your performance and what part are not? On the flip side of that is what kind of outperformance are you getting on alternative energies, from solar to wind and the like, nuclear, etc.? So again, this is all being done right now with certain, obviously, degrees, but that's -- it's not going to be any different, same thing on factors as we know that momentum has been a big driver of returns and quality and growth relative to value, as an example. So you want to analyze your portfolio on the basis of what is my performance attribution? How much of that is coming from outperformance momentum versus lack of performance and value? We provide all those tools, and that's why this franchise is getting stronger and stronger.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys, Just two quick ones. First, on Burgiss. Is there anything else you can say at this point around the actual impact to EPS? It sounds like it's going to be immaterial, but anything else that you can give us there?
Henry Fernandez: Not really. I mean, it's clearly a smaller company compared to us, right? So the hope is that it's going to grow a lot, but it's still early days.
Linda Huber: Yes. In fact, we're picking up some expenses from Burgiss and the integration, it's Linda. But we don't expect to see significant results on this, particularly immediately.
Chris Shutler: Okay, fair enough. And then just the other one is just on the index subscription business. Going back to the -- a couple of questions ago. To put a finer point on that, how much of the growth, I guess, came from what you would characterize as pricing in 2019? And how much do you expect to come from pricing in 2020?
Linda Huber: Sure. Chris, one of the things we like to say of the entirety of the subscription growth part of the business, it's about 1/3 price increases and 2/3 volume for existing and new clients, so less than 1/3 really on price increases.
Chris Shutler: Okay, still consistent?
Linda Huber: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: Good morning guys a question for you, just elaborating on Burgiss. You guys have a minority interest in it, but you guys will have access to all their data. I guess, is this through operating agreements? And then the agreements or your structure with Burgiss, is that going to be exclusive so they -- no one else can partake in their data?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So the -- if you noticed, we always talk about two things. We always talk about the investment and the strategic partnership with them. The goal obviously, hand in hand, the investment is -- we're just a shareholder with the owner and the founder of the company, Jim Kocis. And on the sort of data usage and partnerships and the like, those are subject to separate negotiated agreements one by one as to how do we divide up cost if we're working on a joint product? How we divide up revenues and all of that, and those are being worked on right now.
Keith Housum: But those will be exclusives. So no one else, no competitor can come in there and try to obtain their data, so to speak.
Henry Fernandez: Largely, but not totally, yes.
Keith Housum: Okay, got you. And then just as a follow-up question, this is just more a reminder for me. When it comes to your institutional passive fees, that's a one quarter delay, correct?
Linda Huber: Yes, that is correct.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to CEO, Henry Fernandez, for closing remarks.
Henry Fernandez: Well, I'd like to thank you again for the opportunity to present given the last 10 years of great performance. And obviously, the anticipation of what we can do in the next 10 years. I would like to make sure you all recognize how much we value, the belief that you and our shareholders have put in us, the trust and confidence, in running this great franchise and being good stewards of capital. And we hope we never disappoint in all of that. So thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will aim to limit participants to one question and one follow-up. We will have further instructions for you at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Salli Schwartz, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Salli Schwartz: Thank you, operator. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter. This press release, along with our earnings presentation and a brief third quarter update, are available on our website, msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to, organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 21 to 29 of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run-rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President and COO; and Linda Huber our Chief Financial Officer. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. With that, let me turn the call over to Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Salli. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before I start, I would like to say that we're very pleased to have Salli with us on her first earnings call at MSCI. So congratulations to you Salli and we're fortunate to have you. In the third quarter, we again saw strong performance across our franchise. With over -- with year-over-year growth of 10% in revenue, or 12% on an organic basis, 13% in adjusted EBITDA and 24% in adjusted EPS. In addition to these exceptional financial results, we achieved several significant milestones. We struck new long-term agreements with BlackRock, Intercontinental Exchange, Deutsche Börse and Charles River Development and we acquired Carbon Delta. These agreements aligned as well with key strategic partners and provide us with important capabilities that will continue to enhance our growth and competitive differentiation. On BlackRock, we extended our successful strategic relationship with them for another 10 years through March of 2030. As you are well aware, there are strong secular drivers of assets into ETFs and this new agreement create a tremendous opportunity for MSCI. Our renewed contract with BlackRock aims to maximize long-term revenue growth by further balancing and aligning the price volume mix in our arrangement with them. More specifically on the deal, the current licensee rates BlackRock base to MSCI will be reduced for ETFs with total expense ratio below certain levels according to our phased implementation period. In these ETFs our current fee rates have become a much larger percentage to total fees than originally anticipated. Therefore, the new agreement corrects for that. The aggregate reduction to our total asset-based fee run rate as of September 30 of this year associated with this adjustment is not material. Based on the AUM as of September 30 and based on the most recently confirmed total expense ratios of these ETFs that are subject to recent adjustment. Any potential future reductions in total expense ratios of licensed BlackRock ETFs may reduce the license fee rates payable to MSCI for those ETFs. These fee reductions are balanced by the potential for incremental assets to flow into licensed BlackRock ETFs. As you know well, we have seen substantial growth in ETFs over the past decade, with global ETF assets up again thus far in 2019 by approximately 20%. Our continued aim with BlackRock has been to more closely align our mutual opportunities and successes in the ETF marketplace, and this agreement fully reflects that approach by them and by us. We're very excited about the path we see in front of us, and we believe we're extremely well positioned to benefit from MSCI's ongoing innovation and product development, as well as the underlying trends that support the continued flows into ETFs. We also recently expanded our strategic relationship with the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE, who as you know is a leading operator of global derivative exchanges and clearing houses and a provider of fixed income data. In addition to extending the existing license agreement for list of futures based on MSCI Indices, we licensed to ICE our ESG data for their fixed income index construction, and we licensed from ICE fixed income pricing and reference data to use across MSCI, including for MSCI fixed income indices. We singularly just renewed our strategic relationship with Eurex, one of the world's leading derivative exchanges and part of Deutsche Börse Group in Germany. We've not only extended the terms of our license agreement for the existing MSCI index listed futures in Europe, but also expanded the agreement to include futures on MSCI ESG indices to capitalize on the growing interest in sustainable investment. This type of strategic relationships are mutually beneficial. They drive innovation and they deliver increased value for our clients and the industry as a whole. Similar to our focus on driving value through close strategic relationships with a wide variety of leading industry players, we continue to selectively pursue highly strategic bolt-on acquisitions of companies like Carbon Delta, which enhance our capabilities in key growth areas, generate attractive returns and drive long-term growth and differentiation for MSCI. We're extremely excited by the opportunities that will result across all of these developments. I will now turn the call over to my partner, Baer Pettit, who will provide more color on our continued progress in those two areas of index derivatives and ESG, including the Carbon Delta acquisition.
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. We spoke about index derivatives on our second quarter earnings call, and I'd like to briefly update you on our ongoing progress. Index derivatives, including futures and options continue to gain traction as the investment community use them as effective tools to implement hedging and other strategies. The extension of our contracts with ICE and Eurex that Henry mentioned will strengthen our footprint in this area of our index franchise. In the past quarter, we saw asset-based fee revenue or ABF from futures and options more than triple and the notional value created and listed futures and option linked to MSCI indexes reached a record level of $1.5 trillion. Listed futures and options based on our flagship indexes continue to gain traction with open interest in futures and options linked to our emerging market and EAFE indexes together growing 31% year-over-year. Henry also referenced ES&G, a topic of significant interest not only to the investment community but also to governments, corporations and various other constituencies. We've seen significant growth in interest in MSCI the ES&G ratings research and other products. We continue to enhance our offerings and recently announced the release of ES&G ratings for over 34,000 funds of ETFs in the equity and fixed income universe. ES&G considerations are relevant not only to traditional asset owners and asset managers, but also to wealth managers, retail investor platforms, hedge funds, broker-dealers and corporations. Within all these institutions, we continue to see demand from a growing variety of user types including CIOs, portfolio managers, risk officers, government teams, compliance teams and ES&G specialists. ES&G factors also impact a range of asset classes extending from equity to fixed income to private assets like real estate and private equity. One area where we're seeing significant demand for new product capabilities is climate risk as various market constituencies look to understand and evaluate potential climate change. We intend to be the largest provider of tools for evaluating the impact of climate risk on investment portfolios. To that end, you saw us acquire Carbon Delta, which is a Zurich based environmental fintech and data analytics firm. Together, MSCI and Carbon Delta will offer climate value at-risk and innovative and pioneering climate-risk metric that calculates the impact of client's climate change on a company's market value and helps investors understand and quantify these risks within their portfolios. MSCI's growing set of climate change offerings together with our research, allows investors to more effectively achieve specific climate objectives including avoiding or diversifying carbon risks, gaining exposure to clean technologies and engaging with companies. We will keep you apprise on our ongoing progress in ES&G, which is very clearly becoming an integral part of portfolio construction. And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda to take us through the financial highlights and discuss our current guidance for 2019. Linda?
Linda Huber: Thanks Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. MSCI continued it’s momentum with an eighth straight quarter of organic subscription run rate growth around 10%. This growth was driven by strength across both our geographic regions and our major client segments. Looking first at geographic regions. Our organic subscription run rate was up 8% in the Americas, 11% in EMEA, and 13% in Asia. For asset owners and asset managers, which collectively comprise about two-thirds of our subscription run rate, we saw organic subscription run rate growth of 12% and 10%, respectively. MSCI continues to provide its clients with mission-critical products and superior customer service, leading to healthy mid-90s retention rates across our segments. For recurring net new sales, nine months 2019 was up 8% with the third quarter specifically up 3% while index and ESG saw growth of 12% and 31%. Analytics had lower growth as it left a strong third quarter in 2018. I'd like to draw your attention to non-recurring sales, which were up 32% year-over-year to $14 million, primarily driven by increased sales in our BarraOne and RiskManager product offerings and in our index derivative product offerings. This was the sixth straight quarter of non-recurring sales greater than $8 million. On a year-to-date basis, total non-recurring sales were up 27% including Analytics up 45% and Index up 26%. Turning to our performance in ABF, we continue to benefit from our focus on derivatives with listed futures and options, revenue tripling as Baer referenced earlier. We also note that ABF revenue from futures and options was up over 100% year-over-year even excluding approximately $5 million of additional fees associated with prior periods attributed to retrospective price increase from a renegotiated contract. ETFs ABF revenue was up 5% with a 7% increase in year-over-year average assets under management or AUM and equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, partially offset by year-over-year decline in average basis points. Finally, non-ETF passive funds revenue was up 11%, driven by increased contributions from higher fee products. Equity ETFs AUM linked to MSCI indexes ended the quarter at $815 billion, up 6% versus the prior year. Average fees continue to gradually decline as lower fee products capture a disproportionate share of new flows into equity ETFs. With regards to geographic market exposure, there were $13 billion of inflows into funds based on U.S. exposure indexes, with more than half in ETFs based on MSCI's Factor indexes, primarily in the low volatility and quality products and about one fifth in ETF space on MSCI ESG Indexes. MSCI's operating revenue continued the pace in the third quarter, with growth across all product segments, as we described in our earnings release published this morning. Our strong execution in the quarter resulted in high-quality earnings growth, mainly driven by operating momentum. We had no share repurchases during the third quarter, but our earnings continued benefit from the significant share repurchase activity in late 2018. Free cash flow from third quarter was $174 million, up $43 million year-over-year, primarily driven by higher cash collection and lower income tax payments, partially offset by higher payments of cash expenses and higher capital expenditure costs. Turning to our capital position, our cash balance at the end of the third quarter was $881 million. Our approach to capital allocation remains the same with no changes to, first, our dividend policy of 40% to 50% payout of adjusted EPS; second, our leverage target of three times to 3.5 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA; and third, our approach to mergers partnerships and acquisitions and share repurchases, both of which remain very opportunistic. I'd like to now provide an update on our guidance for the remainder of the year. As we remain focused on driving growth, we will keep investing in a number of high return opportunities. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA expenses and CapEx will be towards the high end of our guidance range of $685 million to $705 million for adjusted EBITDA expenses and $45 million to $55 million for CapEx. With regard to our tax guidance, we are lowering the range of our full year effective tax rate and now expected to be between 6% and 9%. As you're aware, this rate includes an income tax benefit, related to divesting of certain multiyear performance stock units in the first quarter, which has been excluded from adjusted ETFs. Excluding this benefit of approximately 11 percentage points, we now expect the effective tax rate used for our adjusted EPS to be in the range of 17% to 20%. And with regard to free cash flow, we expect to be at/or slightly above the high-end of the guidance range of $545 million to $585 million. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to turn the call back over to Henry.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Linda. I wanted to highlight a press release, we issued this morning announcing the promotion of Alvise Munari to Global Head of Client Coverage, effective January 2 of next year. As well as the retirement of Laurent Seyer, MSCI's Chief Operating Officer and Chief Client Officer. I would like to reiterate my deepest appreciation and gratitude to Laurent for his leadership and dedication to MSCI and to our clients. Laurent has led the transformation of our global client coverage organization and positioned us well to realize the many growth opportunities we have across our businesses. We'd also like to congratulate Alvise on his promotion. Alvise spent a great deal of time in the last few years with Laurent visiting clients. I can attest that he will further develop and expand our global client relationships as we continue to focus on powering better investment decisions made by those same clients. We will now open the line to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. This is probably a five-part question. But want to start with the BlackRock contract extension. So, just assuming expense ratios keep coming down in the industry. Would this sort of enable your fee rates to move more quickly? Also you mentioned the fees implementation period. How long will that be? You mentioned the first adjustment in March, but how many phases are there? And then the license fee rates MSCI and that will be reduced for certainly steps in March, how much of an impact will this be to the average fee rate at that time? And then I want to ask about the $5 million if that's related to the $15 million addition to run rate? And just because you're putting it in the asset fee-based run rate, are you expecting that this $15 million recurs over time? I'll leave it at that.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. So, obviously, we will give you some directional comments of what our arrangement with BlackRock is, but we will not be able to comment on very specific given our policy of not commenting on specific matters pertaining one client. So, it's important to understand the comment under the disclosure that we have made in the following sense. The agreement calls for a series of fees that appears depending on the total expense ratio of each one of these funds. The adjustment that we mentioned that is phased in over about a 10-month period from March of next year relates to those ETFs that as I mentioned in my remarks had abnormally high percentage of their fee being the MSCI fee. So, that takes care of those things and that adjustment based on current AUM and current dollar expense ratio is relatively immaterial to the asset-based fees. The second part of obviously what we're trying to do is for the next 10 years prepare the relationship with BlackRock to be totally aligned with market dynamics that to the extent that there are meaningful changes in the total expense ratio of each fund so in this case obviously coming down that our fee then gets to be commensurate to the level of split that we were intended to from the very beginning in many of those funds. And therefore it appears down depending on the total expense ratio associated with that. And the goal in full alignment with BlackRock is to ensure that they have this flexibility in their own ETFs to trade-off the volume versus price to gain market share and acquire new assets and that MSCI's fees are not in the way of creating a disproportionate amount of our fees to the total expense ratio.
Linda Huber: And Toni, it's Linda. You further asked about the $15 million addition to asset-based fees in the run rate that we spoke about and as you're probably aware we're open to working with a wide range of partners so that we can best help clients achieve their investment objectives. As we have noted we recently renegotiated a few of our agreements as Henry spoke about. And based on the third quarter 2019 trading volumes, we expect that those will add approximately $15 million to our asset-based fees run rate. Now, some of these additions is already in the third quarter ABF run rate and the rest will come into quite in the next six months. That is separate from the impact of the amended BlackRock agreement and we are not able to provide more detail on which companies any of that relates to given confidentiality agreement. So, hope that's helpful and that's all that we can say.
Toni Kaplan: Very helpful. And then my second question is very short. Trying to ask about the agreement with ICE I thought it looks really interesting and just wanted to understand sort of long-term where that relationship would go?
Henry Fernandez: We have a great relationship and increasing one with ICE in two areas -- in two major areas a lot of other areas, but in two major areas. One is clearly the listed futures and options part, which we have had for quite some time. So we renewed that agreement and we renewed our commitment to create new indices for them or license existing indices to them, so that they can continue to launch listed futures based on our IP. The second part of the agreement has to do with their fixed income data business, the former IDC or Interactive Data Corporation business in which they have as you know they have evaluated prices and terms and conditions on an extremely large universe of funds around the world. So we are going to be licensing from them. That relevant data for us to use across a lot of our products on MSCI including potentially MSCI's fixed income indices. Likewise, they're licensing from us our ESG data is the ratings, is the indicators and all that so that they can incorporate ESG criterias or criteria into the construction of their own fixed income indices. So that they can create ICE branded ESG fixed income indices.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. My first question is just around the flows and I think there a lot of numbers out there, so correct me if I'm wrong, but yesterday I think S&P talked about how 70 billion of inflows where there into the non-U.S. size. I think you guys said there was 5 billion of inflows and I believe in the commentary you also said there was positive U.S. inflow. So does that mean non-U.S. was negative or am I just not comparing the right number there?
Linda Huber: Manav, it's Linda. I don't think we want to comment on what other companies have quoted in their earnings release. I think what you have pointed out that's correct. The bulk of inflows was into U.S. funds in the third quarter and a smaller share with -- into emerging market funds. For us, we're stronger in the emerging markets. So the balance was less helpful to us frankly. So can't comment on the other specific numbers, but you certainly have the trends right and just wanted to make sure that you understood the emerging markets fees which has been weaker.
Henry Fernandez: As Linda was talking I was pulling out here the data hard to do that while talking, right. But -- so for the quarter and for the third quarter and related to MSCI-linked ETFs, the total according to our numbers right, total amount of flows into equity ETFs related to MSCI was about $5 billion. And that was made up of increasing flows to U.S. exposure ETFs of about let's say about $13 billion or so slight negative to develop market exposure excluding the U.S. on a $13 billion negative or outflows to emerging markets.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. Congrats on renewing a lot of the contracts that you mentioned. Are there any other notable moving ones coming up that we should be aware of?
Baer Pettit: Nothing on the scale of the ones that we mentioned. I mean clearly, we are in continuous discussions with many of our clients and we don't eventually discuss specific contracts on this call as you're aware. So I think generally we've got a lot of things going on, but nothing that's noteworthy or that stands out.
Henry Fernandez: What I would add Manav is that just to add some strategic commentary is that as you have heard those talk about in the past, we are intensely focused on developing the index licensing franchise over MSCI into derivatives across all forms of derivatives and across the world. So it's obviously that's made-up of listed derivatives, listed in exchanges, futures and options. And therefore, we have a number of partners in the world, the major ones are ICE and Eurex and the Singapore Exchange in Asia. And the second point, we're very focused on over the quarter or structure products derivatives market with broker-dealers and all of those things are significant areas of incremental growth for MSCI, because on the structure product side we haven't been that sort of presence, and on the derivatives side we're getting excited because the market for multi-country and multicurrency index futures is developing fast and we are obviously the largest provider of indices in that space.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Buckingham. Your line is now open.
Hugh Miller: Good morning. Thanks for taking question. Had one on the cost savings given the hiring you made on the head of LEAN practices, I know, it's early days and then it's a hire, but if you could just give us is on kind of the expense savings opportunities that you foresee maybe in 2020? And any key areas that you see as an opportunity to focus on?
Baer Pettit: The way I would characterize that opportunity in that hire is really part of our ongoing business management, which we've discussed on this call over a number of years. So I don't think that, there is any particular area that we view as sort of particularly a target if you like. The one thing, I would say is that, we have been consistent in saying that our one MSCI strategy which brings together a lot of our intellectual property as a benefit to our clients is also an efficiency story. So as we reduce duplication of different technologies as we consolidate databases as we align standards and technology all of those things will create efficiencies over time. And we're very focused on that day-in day-out in the management of the business. So it's not really a specific category, it's just a culture of efficiency and a culture of removing duplication and creating better standards across the firm.
Henry Fernandez: One other comment that I would make on that is that the – we categorize our EBITDA expenses into expenses that are to run the current business and continue to see the revenues of the current business and expenses that are much more investment type, which are to create new things and to change the business and change the direction of the business. So what we're trying to as we said in the Investor Day what we're focused on is we have enormous opportunities to invest at MSCI on very high-return projects given the nature of what we're doing and the demand for what we have. So with the investment dollars to achieve that, so what we're constantly doing as Baer indicated is creating high levels of efficiencies in what we do day-to-day to run our existing operations to free up resources, so that we can invest in those new things and continue to have a gradual margin expansion in the business. So, we believe that that is a very strong discipline over MSCI and it helps us grow the revenue line over time and continue to deliver high levels of profitability in the company.
Hugh Miller: Great. Thank you for the detail. Very, very helpful. And then I guess a follow-up question on the tax rate side. I understand that we're not giving guidance for 2020 overall but given the improvement we've seen this year can you just give us a sense of how we should be thinking about the run rate that's realistic for 2020 for the tax rate?
Linda Huber: Yeah. It's Linda. I think we would prefer not to get into that. There's a world of tax changes happening right now and with a lot of discrete items in motion I think we would prefer to wait until we move into the first quarter of next year to give our views on tax guidance for next year. But please rest assured we will do it when we get to our first quarter earnings call.
Hugh Miller: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris Shutler: Hi, guys. Good morning. On the -- back to the BlackRock agreement. So where, I think, your fees go down as BlackRock reduces its expense ratios. How will that differ versus the way that your current agreement is set up? I thought that you currently price as a percentage of the expense ratio may be tiered, but was that not the case?
Henry Fernandez: What the difference is -- is that there were absolute floors associated with all the funds and therefore what you now have is a number of tiered floors in various, sort of, categories of total expense ratios.
Chris Shutler: Okay. So you said more tiers basically that's the way to think about it?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. Yes.
Chris Shutler: Okay. 
Henry Fernandez: There was always a percentage of the total expense ratio, but there was an absolute floor in which it didn't matter what the total expense ratio was. Our fees cannot go beyond that -- below that. So now what we've done is create a different -- a number of categories of tiers and each tier has it’s own percentage and its own floor which reflects the fact that the market pricing or total expense ratios on ETF are far broader than 10 years ago. There's a much broader range of products and different price points serving different purposes.
Chris Shutler: For sure makes sense. And then the other question I had was regarding the commentary in the press release around the leverage. Current target 3 times to 3.5 times growth to EBITDA. I think you're in the middle of that range today. It sounds like you're considering taking on more debt. Where would you expect to take leverage target or could you take it? And what would you do with that extra capital?
Linda Huber: Sure. As we had said at the quarter end we had $2.6 billion of debt outstanding, which is 3.2 times our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and our stated gross leverage target to adjusted EBITDA is 3 times to 3.5 times. We do monitor the market and we'll be opportunistic as we think about potential financing. We also note that the Board has added another $750 million to our share repurchase authorization to bring us to $1.456 billion and we're going to think about those things very opportunistically.
Chris Shutler: All right. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. 
Bill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. And hello and welcome to Salli. Question for you on the ETF side. There's been some recently announced highly publicized reductions in retail trading fees. And I just wanted to ask what you saw the impact to that would be on ETF demand and pricing for MSCI?
Henry Fernandez: Well I think anything that reduces the friction for trading of financial instruments creates a lot more ability by investors to invest larger amounts in those instruments because they now have less friction to come in or to come out of them. So that was well for ETFs because ETFs are in a much more trading instruments than mutual funds for example. And therefore we anticipate that it will continue to be more asset coming to ETF over and above what is currently coming.
Bill Warmington: And then for my follow-up question. I wanted to ask about the megatrend in the fees just how -- what are you looking at these days in terms of AUMs tied to those? How quickly early growing? When do you think they'd move the needle?
Baer Pettit: So we're still for sure at the ground floor and that I mean these indexes are pretty much hot off the press -- so we've only just launched them. So I don't want to speculate on the exact category. As you can see many of these newer categories of what I would call position exposure type of indexes whether they're in factors or in ES&G have shown very attractive growth. And people there's for certain the market of people who want to have certain market exposures very precisely through indexes. So we would be delighted if they were to follow some of the precedents of the other specialized indexes we have. We don't want to speculate around that. So I think we'll just have to keep you apprised on those developments in the quarters going forward, but certainly from just a -- from a client response point of view and the dialogues we've been having is very positive.
Henry Fernandez: What I would add Bill is that, again sort of whether the more strategic emphasis is that the – we’re moving into MSCI in addition to the flagship market cap indices, the flagship Factor indices, the flagship ESG indices that are more benchmark related to large portfolios. We are rapidly also moving in the direction of creating more narrow, more thematic exposures based on research that we do that translates into these indices and those could be significant demand by ETF providers, by wealth managers, by structured products, over-the-counter derivatives and the like. And therefore this is a whole new growth area for MSCI over time, in which we're just building the underlying indices that will be the basis of portfolios of every kind in the world.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Craig Huber: Yes, thank you. My first question I guess for Linda. Now you've been there a few months Linda, just curious what your brief observations have been so far. What you think investors might be interested in that you might be working on perhaps trying to make the company even more efficient. And I realize it's a very high bar to say that.
Linda Huber: Thanks Craig. Coming up on six months here and it's been an amazing transition. My colleagues are all very impressive, very smart and we moved fast here, mainly driven by Henry's blistering pace. But we continue to work on efficiencies as Baer had described, because we want to be very sure that we're able to continue to make investments in what we call our Triple Crown investments, which will be the ones that have short payout periods, high returns and are in our fastest growing businesses, which would be index and ESG and then our other businesses are also performing really, really well. So incredible focus on where we're going to put our dollars as Henry has indicated this is my primary focus. And I think the program we have to do that is moving very nicely. And as we move into next year, we'll have more to tell you about that, but I think that's the most important thing.
Craig Huber: Then my second question. I guess Henry maybe just update us on the numbers you look at in the U.S. active versus passive. What's the breakdown right now the day you're looking at? And what's your best sense where you think that might be. I know it's tough question to ask I would say in two years out here. Where do you think it, sort of, tops out here if you had to guess?
Henry Fernandez: On a secular -- on a structural basis, clearly passive management continues to grow by leaps and bounds. For a variety of reasons, it creates very easy exposures at a very low cost to an investor. There's a lot of research drawn that clearly those portfolios have performed the majority of active portfolios. So we continue to see that for sure in on a million way with some cycles, obviously, a lot of passive investing can be deemed sometimes to be momentum investing, because you're chasing the things that are going well. And so I don't have the latest statistics of where we are, but I think that the beta as to where the limit is in the short term of passive is not a good one, because there could be a significant amount of assets in the world that are passive not to a point, in which is the vast majority because then obviously it creates opportunities for passive to be able to create. So that's a good run rate for us. But bear in mind also that we have -- a lot of our revenues, more than half of our revenues and our clients are active managers, and therefore, we spend a great deal of time helping them create the tools and their portfolios with the tools and portfolios to outperform passive and to run their businesses better, so that they develop competitive advantage in the industry.
Craig Huber: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Henry Chien with BMO. Your line is now open.
Henry Chien: Hey, good morning everyone. I just had a question on ES&G. So I understand that there's a bit of a secular headwind or tailwind to assets with ES&G mandates in U.S. and Europe. Just with the context of there's a lot of other providers that are data providers that are going after ESG, but it seems like MSCI's doing particularly well. I just wondered like what would you characterize like why is the data -- the ES&G data so compelling for investors or managers versus other data sets for MSCI?
Henry Fernandez : So let me first say that because you read all of these reports, all these newspaper articles and all of that how many data providers succeed and how competitive the market is and so on and so forth. It is very misleading. Obviously, data is a completely necessary condition for success. We have now data, you can't create anything, but on top of that what you need to build is what use this data for end investment process, the mission criticality of, let's say, the materiality of the data, you create a lot of data, but what's material to the investment process and what's material to the impact of a particular company or not. So, when we consider ourselves is the leading provider of those mission-critical tools and the investment process that are taking a lot of ESG into account, whether it's data per sequential, whether it's research, whether it's ratings, whether it's indices, whether it's risk models or whatever. And there are not too many providers in that space. There are not. We have an incredibly amount of runway to continue to lead in that space and that's where we want to be. So, Baer maybe…
Baer Pettit: Yeah. And just maybe to add on that so, and may be reinforcing the point from both the broader point that Henry made and then the narrower example. The broader point is the topic of ES&G needs to be intelligently incorporated into the overall portfolio construction question, whether it's at the total plan level for an asset owner or within a given fund. And so I think it's the combination of the quality of our research and ratings, but also our ability to address the broader context. The second thing I would say is, and I'm drawing on my observations about the Carbon Delta acquisition, I was in Tokyo for the task force for climate-related financial disclosure, which the government of Japan sponsored a few weeks ago and there is dramatic change in the way that both governments and corporations are looking at that. One of the goals of that task force is precisely to look at portfolio impact of climate change, which I was alluding to in my scripted comments earlier. Quite frankly there is no one providing adequate solutions in this area. No one. And so I'm sure there are others attempting to do so. We believe we are ahead of that and we're able to do so the term that they use is uses climate value at-risk, again, this just plays into all the other expertise that we have an understanding portfolio risk, understanding portfolio construction and the broader context in which investors operate. So, yes, there are many disparate enclosed data providers, but I think MSCI's both leading there, but we were able to help with investors at the broader context of their asset allocation and portfolio construction. And I think it's in that that we have unique competitive advantages.
Henry Chien: Got it. That helps a lot. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. I wondered if you could give us an update on your wealth management product. We haven't talked about that I think yet in the call. And any progress you're making, any quantifiable metrics you could put around that?
Baer Pettit: Yes, just to clarify we have a range of products and services which we sell into the wealth segment. And so of our total sales into that segment, we only have one product that I would say was historically defined for it, which continues to say that the sales of that product I would say are in line with our general growth. Overall, our growth into the wealth segment has been above average over the last year or two. This quarter it's a little weak because we have a comparable from last year, which was an enormous sale, one of the biggest sales that we had last year into a very large broker-dealer in Asia. So I would say that we're making steady progress. We'd like to see that that growth is above average and this quarter it's a little below average. So I think we're -- I would say there's no breaking news. We continue to be focused on the segment and we continue to put more resources there.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. And then my follow up. Linda you've been there for a while. What's missing? What are you looking for in the M&A front or what are you working on outside of the efficiency side of things?
Linda Huber: Sure. We continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions. We continue to look in the private asset class base, Henry's talked quite a bit about that. I think we look at database sets which are attractive. That might be useful to us. And we also are looking in the fixed income space to see if there's anything that might be helpful to us there. This is a very time intensive network. My colleague, Andy Wichman, spent a lot of time focusing on the partnership part of things. You can probably see from what we've announced this quarter. We've worked very hard on these partnerships and they're clearly of great importance to us. But I'm quite open in terms of potential acquisitions and we'd like to stress we don't need to buy the entirety of companies we're very happy to look at partnerships structures and maybe I'll turn it over to Henry to see if there's anything else he would like to add.
Henry Fernandez: Look, I think we are building MSCI into various areas. So what is a lot of the work that remains here on the product side is private asset classes, fixed income. On the geographic area is Asia. We've done very well in Asia recently. We're putting enormous amount of attention there because of the wealth creation that exists there with big pension funds wealth, sovereign wealth funds and the like. On the client segment, clearly wealth management was asked before is an area that we need to put a lot more investments in and there's more segments like life insurance for example that we're not very high on and that will correspond with our -- once we get a lot of this fixed income products that we're working on that will be a great place to put a lot of effort because as you know life insurance companies buy a lot of fixed income.
Joseph Foresi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum: Good morning, guys. Just a little bit clarification on the non-recurring revenues, specifically in the futures and derivatives indexes section. I notice you guys, obviously talk about the agreements with ICE and Eurex, but the growth in the futures and listed options was it relative to those agreements this quarter or was there a onetime nature that we should be thinking about the growth that you saw this quarter?
Baer Pettit: So the question is -- so fundamentally the ABF category is of a recurring characteristic, right? So, the areas where the onetime is typically the largest are mostly related to Analytics, which has to do with the implementation of our deals and the related services. And then, in Index, it can be certain sales of specific intellectual property, and occasionally also in the over-the-counter derivatives areas with brokers. We have various catch-up fees, the mechanics of which we won't go into here. But in essence, those are -- it's not in the listed derivatives area that we typically have onetime fees. That is overwhelmingly, a recurring revenue business.
Linda Huber: And to further expand on that, regarding the other parts of the business, just to add to Baer's comments on, Analytics we talked about lumpiness that we see in sales quarter-to-quarter before. This quarter that was particularly acute because Analytics had a very tough comparable compared to a strong third quarter last year. As Baer mentioned, we won a significant contract last year with very large Asian securities firm, on our WealthBench offering, so the lapping was very, very difficult. On the pipeline front though, we see a healthy pipeline. And a relatively moderate cancels. You've seen overall for the firm cancels continue to run -- continue to see that we're running at about 95%, in terms of what were able to do with our subscription revenue. So we feel pretty good about all of that. Hope that, I was able to answer your question.
Keith Housum: You was, thank you.
Linda Huber: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Patrick, your line is now open.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I apologize for that. In light of your new agreement with BlackRock, I was curious to what extent you think that the fees or ETF partners have had to pay in the past. I've concluded them from computing those aggressively in prices they might have otherwise?
Henry Fernandez: I don't think so. In the past all of these are -- you noticed in my comments a lot of these initially is, just cleaning up a few things here and there that are not material. More importantly, what these agreement is, to prepare for the next 10 years. And the market dynamics in those 10 years, I don't think there's any intent at this point to change fees or anything like that. It's just to be ready for that 10-year horizon to compete more aggressively, in the marketplace on the price volume mix so that this ETF by BlackRock continue to acquire a significant amount of assets and a significant amount of market share. So to achieve that, they need to look at their own expense ratios and management fees. And we as a supplier of the IP or IP to them, we cannot be the majority of that expense in our fees. We have to then be commensurate in our percentage or proportion of fees regarding their fees, but that hasn't prevented anybody from competing in the marketplace. The agreement that we had before worked really well. We're now sort of setting the stage for the next level of competition in assets and growth.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great. Thanks. And then, I seem to be hear more about direct indexing these days and firms like Charles Schwab are talking about it. Do you look at direct indexing as an opportunity thread, or really a non-event for you guys?
Baer Pettit: Look, I think, that the -- so, may be putting this into context to the earlier question about passive versus active, right? So we use the -- we typically use the term index ourselves and there are both, a range of different strategies which -- some of which are for the total markets some are for factors or ETFs or the megatrends that we mentioned. Clearly, direct indexing is to -- it shows itself today as a basket of securities. So it's really a basket of securities created for individual. So that is for the moment, that is neither, I would say, an opportunity, nor a threat to us. And I think the question will be, is that structurally different than any other previous coming together of universe of stocks for an individual. There could be opportunities for us there perhaps in providing overlays in portfolio construction and index methodology. But for the moment, I would say, it's fairly neutral for us.
Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Great. Thank you.
Linda Huber: Before we close, I'd like to make one last just quick housekeeping note for everyone who's looking to model fourth quarter. You might have noticed that it's implied that our expenses might be a bit higher in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter. That would be correct. It might be a number that's even around approximately $10 million higher. We wanted to really stress, this first quarter we're picking up expenses for our Carbon Delta acquisition. We just wanted to make sure that everyone understands that. Also, we continue making very selective investments in our strong businesses and we have had a slight increase in head count, most of that in the emerging markets. And as we're having a pretty good year, we do look toward compensation to probably be quite reasonable given the strong financial results we've seen this year. So just thinking about expenses for the fourth quarter please note those areas and just please be aware as we had spoken about before we have closed Carbon Delta and we're picking up those expenses in the fourth quarter. I hope that's helpful to everyone. And I think that about concludes what we have in terms of our remarks.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Wiechmann, Chief Strategy Officer. You may begin.
Andrew Wiechmann : Thank you, Shannon. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter, which is available on our website along with our earnings presentation and a second quarter update. A copy of the release, second quarter update and a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You're cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to, organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures on pages 21 to 28 of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run-rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call with me today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President; and Linda Huber, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Andy. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I start, I would like to say that we're very pleased to have Linda do her first quarterly report to you all on MSCI. I hope you treat her well and she does a good job, right? So our strong performance and momentum in the quarter is being driven by continued strength in all of our offerings. Accelerated by the incredibly attractive opportunities we see across a broad range of new growth from peers. During the first half of each year, our Board and the management team conduct an annual strategic planning process where we explore in great detail relevant plan dynamics, industry developments and all of our MSCI capabilities with a goal of prioritizing the most attractive focus areas for the firm. This year, we came away from the process with an overwhelming sense of excitement about the future of MSCI, and we reaffirm our belief that we are only scratching the surface of what is possible to achieve with this franchise. With the data management, advanced analytical models and sophisticated technology becoming increasingly critical to the investment industry and the role and the value of MSCI is growing every single day. An important discussion internally then has become, how we fuel the investments necessary to pursue the many opportunities we have while preserving our high profit margins. As we have discussed in the past, we have a very rigorous focus on allocating our capital to the highest-returning projects through our internal capital allocation process. We think of our internal spending across 2 broad categories: run the business expenses and change the business investments. Run the business expenses relate to supporting the existing products and capabilities in their current form, while change the business investments relate to enhancing the system business and even more importantly, creating new growth areas for us. A top priority for us is to increase investments allocated to change the business activities. We do this by improving efficiency and productivity and, therefore, squeezing and reducing expenses across run-the-business activities. This way, we can continue to allocate investments to the highest-returning projects and consequently, grow faster and be even more profitable. We spent a little bit of time talking about all of this at the Investor Day. We see a long runway of opportunities and growth for our current run-the-business activities. But we're also extremely excited about the growth potential for the change-the-business activities. Some example of these are: First, new high-growth areas of content creation such as ESG and factors for both equity or fixed income. Fixed income Analytics and indices and real estate and other private asset classes. A second example is new client areas such as wealth management. Key geographies such as Asia, and new index licensing opportunities such as futures and options, listed on exchanges and, obviously, derivatives issued by banks and broker dealers. And the third example is new distribution channels, a new content enabling technology that allows for those distribution channels to prosper. These are all very attractive investment areas in their own right. In addition to complementing and driving even more value to our existing index Analytics franchises. Over the last several months, we have had several notable developments that reinforce our conviction around this change the business investment areas. Let me highlight a few of these developments. First, across content creation dimension. In the first half of the year, 40% of inflows into all U.S. exposure equity ETFs went into ETFs linked to MSCI Indices primarily driven by a $9 billion inflow into EPS linked to our Factor indices. Globally, there was a total of $14 billion of inflows into ETFs linked to our Factor indices. By leveraging our cutting-edge fixed income factor model, we rolled out a new tier multi-asset class Factor framework, which allows clients to seamlessly analyze their portfolios from the highest level of factors all the way down to the most granular ones across any asset class and within any of this -- and within a 1 cohesive tier framework. In fixed income Analytics, this quarter we have a series of new corporate credit curves, which brought in and enhanced our fixed income and multi-asset class capabilities. Well, as example in this content creating category is that we have internally launched a series of fixed income Factor indices that we expect to release to the market later this year. In looking at the client and product dimensions, let me highlight a few of new developments that have give us conviction about our investment plan. We continue to deliver double-digit organic subscription run rate growth of 13% across Asia, 11% within Realty, and 19% and 25% for indices and ESG products sold to wealth managers respectively. [Indiscernible] All the cases that I have cited are good examples of areas where our recent investments and innovation have driven highly profitable, long-term growth in relatively new areas in addition to our existing trajectory of growth in the run-the-business areas. Let me now turn the call over to Baer, who will do a deeper dive into one of our specific areas of growth that I briefly mentioned, which we're extremely excited about. In this quarter, this focus will be on the index ecosystem and the critical role that index-linked derivatives can play in that. Baer
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. As we've talked about in the past, there are 3 important pillars to our index franchise: Active management, passive or what we call indexed management and derivatives. These 3 areas reinforce each other creating an ecosystem of investment and trading activity around our indexes that is globally interconnected. Asset owners who use our indexes as benchmarks will use investible products to advertise cash and manage their exposure relative to the benchmark. These asset owners and active managers will use exchange created and OTC index-linked derivatives to hedge their investments, achieve customized exposures and manage risks relative to the benchmark. The OTC derivative markets for equity indexes have become larger over the years, but have high carrying cost for sell-side market participants. The transition from OTC to listed markets helps these products reduce costs. As volume and liquidity grows in these derivatives, the increased liquidity facilitates the participation of the trading community, benefiting the ecosystem of ETFs and the OTC market. So success in any one of these pillars of our ecosystem creates a virtuous circle that helps drive demand in the others. Within this MSCI index ecosystem, the pillar that has been least developed is derivatives. This is a relatively new growth area for us that we believe could be substantial over time. Historically, the market for a listed index-linked derivatives was almost entirely focused on single market, single currency derivatives where the trading hours and currencies of all the underlying securities were the same. Over the last decade, trading technology has progressed, and our exchange partners have increasingly have success at educating the global trading community on how to trade in listed futures based on our indexes, which are mostly multimarket, multicurrency in nature. To help accelerate the growth of this opportunity, we have invested in building out a team comprised of several key individuals focused heavily on licensing our indexes for listed and OTC derivatives. This team is broadening and deepening our relationships with exchanges and broker-dealers who are generating a healthy pipeline of new index-linked derivative product launches and an elevated focus on promoting index-linked derivatives. Investments in building this team have already provided returns and a quick payback. We are seeing our exchange partners invest in marketing, sales coverage, sell-side partnerships and market maker programs, which aim to foster liquidity formation. Within broker-dealers, we see our clients finding numerous new opportunities to serve their retail and institutional clients with structured products like index-linked notes, swaps and options. Most of these are based on our market cap indexes but increasingly are also used for Factor overlays as well as sematic in ES&G tilts. The incremental revenue to MSCI from licensing this product should be high-margin over time with lower cost growth as we leverage our existing IT. In 2018, revenue from listed futures and options based on our indexes was $17.1 million having grown at a CAGR of 37% from $4.8 million in 2014. The notional value of the open interest on listed features and options based on our indexes has grown at that CAGR of 54% over the last 3 years. We believe this area could have a long trajectory of attractive growth and profitability. As one measure of the potential opportunity in this area, many futures contracts based on single market, single currency indexes from other providers have meaningfully higher traded notional values relative to their ETF AUM linked to those indexes than those of MSCI. Our active focus on index-linked derivatives highlights just one strong example of how we are investing to capitalize on the wide range of new growth frontiers in front of us. While we are discussing the pillars of index growth, I thought it would be important to provide a brief update on our iShares relationship. The current terms of our ETF licenses are scheduled to expire in March of next year subject to relatively short-term evergreen renewal provisions. We are now engaged in advance constructive discussions with iShares around the new long-term agreement. Our objective is to continue to expand our successful partnership by balancing the price volume mix in order to maximize long-term revenue growth. Please note that we'll not be able to answer questions or provide more information about the negotiations until we have a final agreement, which we expect to occur within the next few months. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Linda to take us through the financial highlights and discuss guidance for the remainder of the year.  Linda?
Linda Huber: Thanks, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. MSCI's second quarter was another quarter of strong financial performance. On the operating side of our performance was solid but a tough lap given the exceptional second quarter in 2018. And double-digit organic subscription run rate growth was driven by strength across regions and major client segments. Specifically, the Americas were up 8%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia was up 13%. Asset owners, asset managers and broker-dealers, which collectively comprise more than 80% of our subscription run rate, saw organic subscription run rate growth of 9%, 10% and 10%, respectively. Our strong focus on continually adding value to our clients has helped us achieve a retention rate of 95.5% in Q2, the highest level in the last decade. Our consistently high retention rates have helped drive organic subscription run rate growth of approximately 10% for the last 7 consecutive quarters. For recurring net new sales, the first half was up 11% with Q2 down 3%. As I mentioned previously, the lower growth rate in the second quarter was the result of lapping a very strong Q2 2018. Also in Q2, we saw continued momentum across product segments. I'll now discuss specifics for each of the product lines. First for ESG. We continued our exceptional run across client segments and geographies. Within client segments, run rate growth was 24% for our larger segment, asset managers, which was complemented by exceptional growth of more than 50% for hedge funds and broker-dealers. Across geographies, we had run rate growth of 50% in Asia, 27% in EMEA and 18% in the Americas. It was also our second highest quarter ever in terms of both recurring sales and recurring net new sales for ESG. Second, Index delivered another quarter of double-digit subscription run rate growth with Factors growing at 25%, ESG growing at 48% and custom and specialized modules growing at 14%. And we continue to see consistent performance in our core market cap products, which had 10% growth. Additionally, we have strong retention rate of 97%. Third, for Analytics, as we repeatedly mentioned in previous calls, operating metrics can be lumpy quarter-over-quarter. This is increasingly so as we're seeing larger and more complex deals being closed. Our recurring sales for the quarter was $14 million, lower than second quarter of 2018, which was itself up 44% over Q2 '17 making for a tough comparison. However, recurring sales were up 7% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We continue to have positive momentum with a strong retention rate of 94% and continued strength in multi-asset class and fixed income Analytics, which collectively had run rate growth of 7%. And finally, for Real Estate, our organic run rate growth was 11% with strong traction in our market information offering. Finally, we'd like to spotlight our nonrecurring or onetime sale, which were up 7% to $9 million versus the prior year period primarily driven by increased sales in our index derivatives and RiskManager product offerings. Next, turning to our performance in ETF. We continued to benefit from our focus on derivatives with listed futures and options revenue growing 20% driven by 17% year-over-year volume growth. Most notably, volume and listed futures linked to MSCI's EM and ESA indices together grew 24%. ETF ABF revenue was down about 1% with a modest increase in year-over-year average AUM in equity ETFs linked into MSCI Indices offset by year-over-year decline in average basis points. Equity ETF assets under management linked to MSCI Indices ended the quarter at $819 billion, up 10% versus prior year driven by market appreciation across all geographies and continued flows into U.S. exposure products offset by outflows from emerging market exposures. Overall, we saw more than $7 billion of inflows into ETFs based on our Factor in ESG Indexes. Additionally, there's an inflow of $5.9 billion in funds based on U.S. exposure indexes where half of the flows were in ETFs based on our Factor indexes. These flows were directed primarily into low volatility products while more than 1/4 of the inflows into ETFs were based on our ESG Indexes. And turning now to capital allocation. We're continuing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders with a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend or an increase to $0.68 from $0.58 per share. We have consistently increased our dividends to shareholders, which has grown at a CAGR of 30% for the last 5 years. We had no share repurchases during the quarter, as it is our policy to repurchase opportunistically. As a reminder, however, we have returned more than $1 billion through share repurchases since the beginning of 2018. Looking at our cash balance. Our cash balance at the end of Q2 was $771 million. And that our policy is to maintain a minimum of approximately $200 million to $250 million of cash globally for general operating purposes. Turning to free cash flow for Q2. This was $177 million, down $23 million from Q2 2018. The primary drivers of this decline were the timing of collections, higher payments for interest payments and cash expenses particularly offset by benefits from lower tax payments. Our approach to capital allocation remains the same with no changes to our dividend policy, our leverage target or our approach to repurchases. And lastly, I'd like to provide an update on our guidance for the year. Given our strong business performance and our focus on driving growth, we will continue with our plan to invest on a number of high-returning growth opportunities. These investments are expected to drive our adjusted EBITDA expenses and CapEx to the high end of the guidance range or $685 million to $705 million for EBITDA expenses and $45 million to $55 million for CapEx. With regards to our tax guidance, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 8% and 11%. This includes the income tax benefit related to divesting of certain multiyear PSUs in the first quarter of approximately 11 percentage points, which has been excluded from adjusted EPS. Excluding this benefit, we expect the effective tax rate used for our adjusted EPS to be in the range of 19% to 22%. And with that, we'll open the line to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: My first question is just around the ESG initiatives. Obviously, some impressive growth rates there you guys called out. But maybe just more broadly, we've seen a lot of other names in that space due to make some tuck-in acquisitions, put together their own initiatives, lot of PR around it. I was just wondering like how you look at the competitive landscape? And if there is just a bunch of white spaces that may be everybody has an opportunity here.
Henry Fernandez: So thanks, Manav, for that question. Purely the opportunity on ESG or sustainable investing in the world is enormous. Over time, as ESG factors get integrated into mainstream investing, we may not be talking about ESG investing or sustainable investing, it will be all investing in which if somebody is not taking sustainability into account will be the base and their fiduciary duties, right? So it's a huge white space. We have had an incredible success and continue to do so. We've had a lot of investments into this area that have propelled significant growth. We have a product set that is cut across-the-board from ESG research for exclusions and screening to ESG ratings, to ESG indices, to ESG as a Factor in risk models. We are now taking all of that ESG content and putting it into our technology platform distribution channels and the like. So we are also expanding from ratings into equity, to large amounts of ratings into fixed income, which is an area that we want to focus on. This -- some of this fixed income indices that I have mentioned that we have lunched internally, our own Factor indices, but the team is also working on ESG indices as well, and the like. So we feel pretty good of where we are. A lot of what were doing is organic growth. We will also look at acquisition opportunities that present themselves but they have to be very targeted and value-added for us with the right financial returns. And I'm sure this area will attract a lot of providers and competitors, but we feel pretty good about the leadership position that we have and we're maintaining in the space.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe just for Linda, and welcome to the call. The comments around the lumpiness and the analytic sales. I guess, is that just implying that there was a bunch of contract that may be got pushed out? I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more specific to the quarter.
Linda Huber: Sure, Manav. And I'll let Baer add to this. But as we've said quite a few times and we mentioned in the prepared comments that we've already made, lumpiness is a factor of the Analytics business. Specifically, if a couple of deals had moved a few days, we would have found the results to be a bit different. So nothing particularly unusual going on there, and I'll see if Baer has anything else he wants to add.
Baer Pettit: No. The only other comment I would make would be about the retention rate, which is 220 basis points year-on-year. That's always been an important indicator for us for the health of the Analytics business. And so I think overall, there's no change in the trend, there's no change in our previous comments and we're carrying on as normal.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Henry, historically, you've had a different profile in your Index business and your largest competitor there. And basically, they've had sort of a bigger piece of their business and asset-based fees and traded products. And now it seems like you have a real opportunity in the traded product space to get increasingly larger there. And so I guess, that's an observation but my question is, how do you see MSCI's business model changing over time? Like do you see the subscription component going down because of the bigger opportunity in the traded products area? And anything you could add there would be helpful.
Henry Fernandez: Yes, so as Baer indicated, the 3 legs of our stool that keeps the stool together, right, is the active management, passive management and derivatives management, right, exposure management or agent management. And we traditionally -- we started, obviously, with this subscription part, which is active management and grew that and continue to grow that enormously. That 10%, 11% growth in index subscription is all active management with a lot of new products, a lot of new clients and a lot of new use cases, etc. Then obviously, way back, we were the inventors of the international ETF business by licensing them to Morgan Stanley, and that has grown enormously and now we're not only international across border but we're also domestic -- with domestic indices in many areas like we mentioned about the U.S. exposure indices through factors and ESG and all of that. And so that we continue to grow and that will be another big runway in our growth there. And the third part is obviously, derivatives. We have always been license and broker-dealers about over-the-counter derivatives but the absence of future -- listed futures and options in multi-country, multicurrency indices was a slowdown, was a difficulty in the explosion or the potential growth of over-the-counter derivatives. So a few years back, maybe 5, 6, 7 years back, the model was broken in the sense that we were able to find a path for this multicountry, multicurrency index futures with our change partners to trade in a time zone in which the underlines are sometimes sleeping and, therefore, the success of the MSCI emerging market futures contract, which is now the third largest futures contract in the world in open interest, the EAFA contract, and all of that. So that has created a path forward for this -- the growth of this industry, which would be more logical to have because the investment process, and not single country, single currency, the whole investment is global and is regional. So why should derivatives not been that. We are anticipating 10 years time, 15 years time that actually multi-country, multicurrency derivatives may become larger than national ones. And we want to be the leading -- one of the leading providers of indices in that area. So and as Baer indicated, this is all an ecosystem that the more derivatives you have, the more trading in ETFs and the more trading in over-the-counter and, hopefully, the more active management that takes place. So it's all an ecosystem of liquidity and reinforcing one another across the world.
Toni Kaplan: That's very helpful. And you mentioned launching fixed income Factor indices. Congratulations. Obviously, fixed income has been an area that you've been investing in and focusing for some time. And so I guess, my question is what has changed that has enabled you to be able to provide this now? Like what has changed internally that has gotten you to this place? Because I haven't seen it, it's a little different than The Street.
Baer Pettit: Sure. Yes, so Toni, what's really different is if you think about the equity indexes, from the very outset, they were global and market cap weighted or in fixed income currency issuance weighted. So what we've taken quite a different strategy in fixed income, which is to start with clearly differentiated. You could call them more specialized indexes, which will serve very particular client needs and product needs. So we felt that in this space, we could use some of our -- the thought leadership and the content that we have from fixed income Analytics and also the infrastructure that we have there. So we -- this has been kind of an exciting little entrepreneurial venture within the firm, and we should be bringing this to market as we said later in the year. We're having really exciting discussions with some pretty major market counterparties about this. And for sure, this will not be a major business line in the short run, but we think it will be -- using this model of driving it from a licensing business, we hope to then develop the income to then to sell finance this venture so that it becomes self financing through licensing income from a very -- the early stages. So it's small, but I think it will be innovative, it will be different, and I think that's what we hope to do to bring something new and innovative to this space.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. Sounds like you have a lot to look forward to.
Baer Pettit: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm: I guess, just coming back to the Analytics sales question from earlier. Appreciate the lumpiness in the business but would love to hear updated thoughts on the environment more broadly. Some of your competitors -- not competitors but other players in the space have certainly acknowledged the consolidation in the industry. Obviously, struggles on the sell-side in some areas. So I know you have been very immune so far but just curious how the -- all the environment is getting tougher? Or what are you experiencing out there?
Baer Pettit: So Alex, look. For sure as you're aware the -- all of our -- all the various client bases that we deal with are focused on efficiency and operating their firms and allocating their expenses in the most efficient manner. That has actually been a central pillar of our Analytics sales strategy. It actually to go not merely with an analytical offering to give them better understanding of their portfolios, but to work on creating efficiency in their organizations through better data management so that they can use more technology and fewer humans, etc. So I would say that our response to or our strategy had been very much catering to that environment that you referred to. And consequently, the result is that we continue to be confident with the Analytics story. We continue to be confident in the matter that we described a steady progression of growth, and at present, even though as we said, there's this lumpiness, there's sometimes a big deal that doesn't make in a given quarter. Fundamentally, our guidance that we've given before on this product area and how we're managing in and the growth trajectory is unchanged.
Henry Fernandez: I would add to that. Also Alex, that the -- first of all, it's very important that we say one more time, we're very comfortable where we are in the trajectory of this. And if we saw any alarm bells or whatever, you're going to be the first one to tell you. So and all of that. Secondly, is that, we're very optimistic about all of this because the client all over that we're having along the lines that Baer described, is pretty positive. The high level of retention rates that are almost record levels of retention rates in this area which in the past sometimes you all have questions about this are another proof that our offering is sticky to people and, therefore, not subject to competitive pressures, for example. So that's a second area. And a third area is that as we improve our technology, not only our content but as we improve our technology it's going to unleash a lot more value of that content in the hands of the clients and that's the 1 area we're putting a lot of effort into it because we believe that for every unit or content in our space we should be selling a lot more but that the handicap there has always been the enabling technology to make the use cases work.
Alex Kramm: Fair enough. And then just shifting gears actually to Linda, first of all, welcome to your first earnings call. Great to have you. But semi-personal question here but obviously, you've been there for 3 months now. This is your first earnings call. Would be very curious to hear what you've been focused on? What you're seeing from a bigger picture perspective in particular as you kind of make your mark on this organization? MSCI has become a very, very well oiled machine over the last few years. So it seems like there's not much room -- not a lot of room for improvement. So curious what you think you can do and where you've been spending your time?
Linda Huber: Alex, thanks for the very kind question. Working for Mr. Fernandez here, theres is always room for improvement, which I think my colleagues would agree with that statement. Alex, the real challenge here is to keep the growth trajectory moving forward, and to really take advantage of these incredible opportunities ahead of us. It's been a great first 90 days. Been spending my time and traveling, learning the business, and the big focus here is on our internal capital allocation process as Henry said. We want to make sure we get these investments right, that we put them in the right places where they have strong returns, relatively short payoffs and that we focus on the areas, which are valued most highly by the shareholders. So this place is a quite a well-run machine but there's always opportunity for improvement and I look forward to that as we move into the operating plan part of the cycle.
Henry Fernandez: So Linda's middle name is ICAAP. Linda Aycock Huber, which is internal capital allocation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Drew Kootman: This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. Just wanted to touch on the M&A front. You guys have talked about continuing to expand the new initiatives. So just seeing how the pipeline looks for that?
Henry Fernandez: Good question. I mean, the focus on MSCI has traditionally been, in the last X number of years, on organic growth, and we're very proud of that and we want to continue that especially because as our franchise grows and our infrastructure grows, think about the platform of data and content and technology and research, on top of that, the incremental investments in that platform gets lower for every unit of revenue that we can produce. And therefore, the more organic -- we build a virtuous circle that the more organic investments, the higher the rate of return on those investments because they are made at the margin. The costs of the margin and the revenue expands dramatically. So that's one reason why it's pretty imperative to look at mostly organic growth, because we are not going to find those rates of return anywhere else in the marketplace. Having said that, there are always a few strategic areas that we're looking at to add to those capabilities, but they have to be extensions of what we do, not going out of our field and they have to have very high rates of return because the returns in buying back our shares are extremely high as we proved last year, the internal capital allocation and returns to these projects are extremely high and therefore, the cost of putting capital to work is an acquisition that is great returns but not as great as the organic ones as high. So that's why we're so focused on this area. But we look at everything, obviously, because it's our fiduciary duty to do so.
Drew Kootman: Got it. And then just wondering if you'd talk about any shifts you're seeing in the demand environment? And how AUMs are shifting? What you expect moving forward?
Henry Fernandez: So I think we -- look, we have been very pleasantly surprised that after an incredibly run-up in '18 in AUM and ETFs and part of '17 with some of volatility at the end of '18, of course, right, but the AUM levels have held up extraordinarily high and continue to do so around the world. There's been a lot of shifts so obviously, emerging having done as well. The U.S. market has done incredibly well. Some developed market areas are stronger, some other ones are weaker, but we're very proud of the diversification we have in all of that, because if the U.S. market is doing well, we have a lot of factor in [indiscernible] indices and. If developed markets do well and the emerging markets do well, we're the big cahuna there, right? And if we -- and we have a lot of these flows coming in into all these ETFs. So I think that this is a great franchise and the key is to continue to feed it and diversify it and innovate constantly and that's the reason why the fixed income factor on ESG indices is a big building block into that.
Drew Kootman: Perfect, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington: So you highlighted Asia as a growth geography, and I just wanted to ask, how much revenue do you generate from Asia today? And how much revenue do you think you'll generate from Asia in 5 years?
Henry Fernandez: So look, Asia is an area that we have not been happy with even though it was growing at a healthy pace before, but during the enormous amount of savings that are being -- going into institutional asset owners in Asia, and the enormous amount of wealth creation in individuals and the growth of wealth management in the region, all of that is something that we look at and we say why can we not be growing double or triple what we're growing today. And we've always been an Asian house. I for one been visiting Asia for 4 years now consistently and we always had a big presence in Asia in all the countries. So if anything today, most of our employees are in Asia, just to put that in there. So therefore, we did a wholesale change of the client coverage team in the last sort of 18 months in Asia with the appointment of a Senior Manager for the whole region. Some of the country heads were changed. So we reorganized the region. We are putting product heads and all of that. And we are so actually, presently surprised how fast that impact has been had in the -- that's why the quarterly reports highlights the growth in Asia even though some of these managers have just arrived in the last few quarters. So I think that will be great. I think in terms of a split, right now, of the let's say -- of when you look at the total subscription run rate, so not including the ETF for a minute, we have about $1.2 billion in subscription and about $200 million of that is Asia or about 13%. Over the next 10 years, that number has to be a lot bigger and it won't happen because EMEA and America is going down. It has to be because the rate of growth of Asia needs to be a lot bigger than the other regions and we are now very well positioned to attack that in a big way. The other thing I would highlight is that when you look at the ETF market, clearly, the vast majority of the ETF linked to the MSCI Indices are listed in the U.S., but a large -- a minority of those ETFs are purchased by Asian investors. There are some statistics that may be in the order of 20% to 30%, sometimes 15%, 20%, 30% of those ETFs sometimes are purchased by Asian investors in the U.S. time zone. So a big number, maybe, it's not high enough but it's a meaningful number. It's hard to analyze all of this going underneath the ETFs.
Bill Warmington: Well, the other question that came to mind as you've been discussing all the derivatives was, I was wondering how long was it going to be before we got some ESG derivatives?
Baer Pettit: Very shortly. We've got some launches coming up and so for sure you'll see more of those. We've got some recent launches and the category, which we're very confident will grow.
Bill Warmington: And then of course, a shout out to Linda just saying congratulations and welcome.
Linda Huber: Thanks very much, Bill. We dug up the Asian run rate number, it's up $200 million. Obviously, we're looking to improve on that. We're making some investments in the Asia region particularly in coverage, and we think there's more to come there. Thanks, again, Bill.
Bill Warmington: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugh Miller with Buckingham. Your line is open.
Hugh Miller: I had one here with regard to, you noted a really nice business win displacing a competitors standard benchmark with the MSCI U.S.A. Index. And also noted just some of your expertise and factors helping to win that. Obviously, I think you guys enjoy benefits from being the name brand benchmark in several geographies. Wanted to get a sense of kind of how you guys think about just mitigating displacement risk with the areas that you have very strong name brand recognition in? And how you think about solidifying your moat to just kind of reduce any displacement risk out there?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, so a few comments. I think all the remarks that Baer went through in terms of the ecosystem create a huge moat around our indices because if you're an asset allocater or pension fund or sovereign wealth fund that your at an MSCI shop with respect to your policy benchmarks. You can give active managers, you can do passive, you can do overlays through futures and options, you could do over-the-counter derivatives like swaps and the like, and therefore, you don't have to be deviating from taking basic risk from your benchmark. So that's a big huge moat around that. The second big area that we worked on is in Malaysia. And productivity and new product development and don't underestimate how hugely important that is in the market cap indices is a continued process of security inclusion and country inclusion and the like in which we work closely with the various countries around the world to see who's opening up. And we go to our investors and go to those countries to be included. Secondly, is all the innovation we're doing in ESG and factors and all of that, that represents, in a way, a different builds of the portfolio as well. So that's the second part. And the third part is services. The services that we can provide to our clients especially our asset manager clients in terms of helping them build internal indices for managing their own processes internally so that sometimes people have talked about self index as being a threat. It's actually a big opportunity for us because they can -- some clients that want to do their own indices themselves to build their own portfolios, they can rent our entire infrastructure to do that. So there are lot of drivers of continued growth and profitability in this space.
Hugh Miller: That's a very helpful color. I appreciate it. And just as a follow-up you noted in the AUM drivers for the ETFs that we're seeing just a shift in demand toward U.S. equities that the long-term outlook is very favorable for your products and services. I guess, as I think about your expertise and factor investing and momentum, etc, are you guys expecting that in the near term though that they will likely continue to be kind of a skewed toward demand for U.S. equities relative to international?
Baer Pettit: Well, clearly it's a -- it's been a -- if you look at the historical context, it's a relatively new category for us. We're really excited by it. For sure, it's been a focus of ours, but the -- what we've seen successes have probably been at the high end of our expectations. And I think we view it as kind of a flanking strategy to have this specialized content, this innovative content to then be more present in U.S. equities. That's kind of if you like a product driven bottom-up, and then top down as we see asset owners, mandates when they look at their total portfolio based on an equity and drill down and give mandates -- we're seeing more and more going out with MSCI U.S.A. benchmarks rather than some of the incumbents. So we think that this is a space where people's perceptions are altering. They are making decisions that they may not have made a few years ago, and we see the trend continuing. So we're pretty excited about that. And I think we've got increasing interest from many of our partners whether it's in ETFs or the derivatives areas to help support that because they love seeing this type of innovation and change as well. So I think we're on a good trend, and we believe it will continue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: Sounds like your spending a little more time thinking about M&A and inorganic opportunities. Maybe just getting little more specific regarding how you think about rates of return and payback periods? And fair to say the stuff that you would consider would likely be more of the tuck-in variety types of deal?
Henry Fernandez: No, Chris. I will not say we're spending more time on it. I think we're spending the same amount of time. What is changing though is that MSCI is an open architecture business. We want to develop many, many more partnerships. So obviously, we have great partnership with our clients. We want to -- we have certain partnership with distribution channels and we want to do 360 partnership, we want to have many more partnership with suppliers of data. So for example, in the private asset class base, we'll have to go buy the data or buy the company, we can have a partnership to use the data, for example. We do that in fixed income indices. We're not vertically integrated in fixed income indices. We have partnerships that deals with terms and conditions and the valuated prices and like, right? So we want to partnerships in sideways in terms of technology providers, academic institutions in order to help build new models and the like. So the area where we are really exploding in activity is in the area of those partnerships, which is -- they have kind of M&A components to them because you got to understand what the venture of the partnership is and what is the property and what are the royalties and how do you structure the agreement and the like? But they don't have meaningful outlays of money and you have to look at the returns the time and effort that you've put into them and the like. So we're not out there fishing for big transformative deals. If somebody comes to us and say can you buy us in a strategic and is extremely low price. We're not going to say no, right? But we're not actively looking at any of those.
Chris Shutler: Okay. And then speaking kind of big transformative deals, there was 1 announced this morning, with LSE and Refinitiv, just any high level comments you can provide on impacts to MSCI good or bad from that deal?
Henry Fernandez: So look, first, kudos to them, both of them and their owners because sounds like a great deal for them and obviously, the market reaction has been pretty positive. We've had extensive relationship, some partnership with both parties in various areas, and every indication is that will continue and in some cases spread thing, for example. So that's -- so the implications to that, to us, there's no change at all in our strategy. Obviously, when this came up, we've talked about it, we had a Board meeting earlier this week, obviously, because of the earnings release. So we talked to our Board. And there's no change in the strategy. We are staying our course. There is -- as a result of that, there's nothing that we say we have to go do or buy. There may be some deals that happened as a result of that, some good deals, some shareholder disruption deals. But we don't want to partake in any of those.
Chris Shutler: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Henry Tsai with BMO. Your line is open.
Henry Tsai: I had a question around -- so there was a lot of cool products that you guys are building and it's very exciting all the different markets that you're going after whether ESG or factors. I wanted to ask about some of the comments you made around prioritizing based off ROI or return on investments, just how are you kind of, beyond just the quantitative metrics, how do you actually think about, which like data products are -- how do you think about the returns whether it's the size of the market or like the ease of creation? Just how do you kind of -- what's your framework for that?
Henry Fernandez: Sure. So first of all, for all of our mix, so for all of our ongoing projects, we track all of them, the expenses and the financial returns through our operating process, our monthly business reviews, etc. We're constantly on top of those. There's clearly a broad range, there are certain categories of content where we're allowing for existing infrastructure. We can typically make a pretty good judgment about -- that we'll have a modest investment and a relatively fast return. If it's some variation of existing content or tweaking methodologies or developing new ones, and clearly, when we're looking at more substantive investments, if we look at, let's say, our technology infrastructure, etc, we're clearly looking at both a broad market -- the broader market opportunity, the competition, those are the type of the discussions that we have in our strategy meetings with the Board, etc. So I think it's really kind of fit for purpose depending on the scale and the time horizon. Linda, any other observations from your recent observations?
Linda Huber: Sure. Henry, I think it's appropriate to say the rigor and the discipline around this year is extraordinary and that will continue as we go forward. There is a pretty remarkable array of really high return investments that we can make. And let me just a few more things about this, you've heard a lot about what we're doing in index with the new products, because with think getting to market first really is a huge advantage. You've heard about the investments in index, in fixed income and in factors. In ESG, I think we have touched on some of the things we're doing including technology and quality enhancements to help drive our coverage in that area, which has been returning very well for us and very quickly. We probably didn't say enough about our go-to-market strategy. We're exploring the wealth management area. We're thinking about that and obviously, we're looking to make appropriate investments, as Henry had spoken about, in Asia, particularly, to drive our coverage capabilities there. We were just looking at the run rate in Asia, it's up 13% for the quarter year-over-year, which shows that, that's starting to payoff, which is really great. And then lastly, investments in technology, in our technology team to drive all of that. We've made some great new hires lately and I think we're really approaching a very exciting period of expansion and capability in the technology area. So everything feels pretty good. It's underpinned by the fact that we feel relatively good about the market tone and tenor now. We're appropriately cautious but we are leaning forward here and we think there's a lot of great stuff to do. And if I've missed anything, Henry is going to add.
Henry Fernandez: One last point in this is since this is such an important area and we've emphasized investments in the company. All of our investments are not because we want to be bigger or have more people or even have more revenues or even have more profits. All of those are means to an end. All of our investments are here to create shareholder value. And if the investment is going to make shareholder value, it doesn't go anywhere. And that's why we focus on the returns on that investment. We clearly have to -- you have to focus first on the strategy, that's something we want to be in or not, but once you're beyond that, what is the return, what's the payback. The quicker the payback the better. And Importantly, what is the valuation of those. Not every dollar EBITDA has the same value and therefore, we got to go to investments in which the results of the profit that bring -- that are brought out of that have high multiples. So that's what we are, and we're very materialistic about that because that's what we're here to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.
Craig Huber: Maybe, Henry, I'll start with you, if I could. Just a broad question here. What's worrying you? Is it -- as CEO of your company right now the most and put aside the obvious of a potential bear market down the road, taking macro issue. What's worrying you most right now?
Henry Fernandez: A lot of people ask me that question, by the way. And Craig and the answer that I give consistently across pretty much every aspect of it is that I feel fortunate enough, I'm privileged enough to be working at a company that has an opportunity to create -- to change the investment world and create enormous amount of value for our shareholders and our clients and the like. And what worries me and keeps me up at night is how do I not make that up?
Craig Huber: Okay. That was quick. Appreciate that.
Henry Fernandez: Very short and sweet. Don't mess it up.
Craig Huber: Don't mess it up. Probably tell that to Linda as well, right, when you hired her. Congratulations, Linda. Let me ask you about Analytics if I could. The last 3 quarters, I guess, the organic growth there high-single digits. It's been obviously a number of years coming there. It's good to see and stuff. Can you just briefly tell us what sort of change from your end to help accelerate growth to that? How sustainable do you think it is to have growth there above mid-single digits for a while to come?
Baer Pettit: Yes, look, I think the nature of Analytics is that both the strategy, which I alluded to earlier, which is both the quality and innovation, the Analytics themselves helping our clients communicate with their clients, helping them build better portfolios, but also extremely importantly, to stress this again, helping them be more efficient is a critical part of our offering and our goal is working, right? Then another element of that is that, that means that we are as much, really, a service to them as a seller of products. A lot of what we do is in the form of reporting in services that help them with their data management. That is an increasing part of the Analytics run rate and continues to be so. Again, we're repeating the critical point from earlier, the retention rate is up roughly 220 basis points. That is an important indicator for us because it shows us that our clients are happier with what we're offering them. So this is a, I think, a solid, steady progression, where we're focused on executing every day, every week, and if we continue to do so we should continue, this trajectory should continue. And I'm particularly pleased that we have been, I would say, called this right in our communication to you and to the market, i.e., we never said that it was going to be rapid or dramatic in exchange, but we said it would be consistent over time and that we would deliver, and that's the same message that we continue to give.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Housum: I have a question for you. I'm just trying to understand, you guys, we look at EPS going out after the next year or so. If I first want to understand the history, you guys have been able to move a lot of your employees from developed markets to emerging markets. How critical to EPS growth over the past 2 or 3 years has that been? And two, how much more opportunity is that as you look forward over the next year or 2?
Henry Fernandez: So look, I think that in terms of the overall cost structure of the company, our major move and location in emerging market centers has been critical to the expansion of people and capabilities. But more importantly, it's not just about the cost, it's about the great quality of these people and the ability that we have had to create new products and new services by operating in a lot of these places with a lot of more flexibility and expandability and the like. So that has driven, I would say, the top line much more importantly than just the cost line, because when you aggregate the cost of all emerging markets even though it's 60-plus percent of employees is a lot lower relative to the high cost centers that we operate in. I think -- so that's the specific answers. Clearly, the EPS has been growing significantly over the years by the increase in revenue growth, by the expansion of the operating leverage, the expansion of the EBITDA margin by the leverage of the company, the significant buyback of shares and obviously the major drop in the tax rate that we've seen in the last few years.
Linda Huber: It's Linda. The number is 63% of our employees in the emerging market centers. And let me just give you a bit of color. Having traveled to many of them over the past 3 months, I've been incredibly impressed by the quality of the people that we have in the emerging market centers, and it is remarkable that this company already has a well thought out and well-oiled structure to have emerging market centers really well integrated with the developing market centers. This isn't a case where we have to go change all that, it's already done. And that does help our costs, obviously, but as Henry said, it is more about the quality. Going forward on EPS, I think Henry touched on, we have, as with most other U.S. companies, been the beneficiary of wind at our backs from the tax law changes, we'll see what happens as the final strokes are done in terms of implementation of those changes that were announced at beginning of this year, but that driver may weaken a little bit as we move forward. We will continue to buy back shares opportunistically and we will keep that discipline, but obviously, we're optimistic as we move forward, but we're going to focus a little heavy -- more heavily on the operational part of things, because the tax turbocharging may fade a bit as we move into 2020, particularly.
Jeffrey Silber: Yes. Got it. Thank you. Appreciate the color. And just another quick question. Earlier questions were obviously more focused on the analytical sales in the quarter. Just remind us like how was the average size of your typical analytical sales?
Baer Pettit: We have that number in front of us. Look, It's quite a broad range, is it -- it's the simplest answer. So typically the very low end of the range is like sort of $50,000, $75,000 for some simple equity type solutions, typically, and then at the higher end for large firmwide multi-asset class solutions. We're into the multiple millions, right? So we can dig out the numbers, but the short answer is, it's a pretty broad range. And a good part of them is -- the good part of the revenue comes from the bigger deals, but we have a really broad pipeline with a lot of different use cases and we can give you some more detail offline.
Henry Fernandez: The other important part of that question is that as time has gone by, the high end of those sales, the high-end of the size of those sales has dramatically increased. A big deal used to be, many years ago, $750,000, $800,000, a big deal today is multimillion. And therefore, in every single quarter, if one of those slips from 1 -- from the last week of the quarter to the first week of the second -- of the next quarter, then you say, what happened to the analytic sales, they are weaker or they are -- why they are so strong. And so the best way to look at our Analytics sales is on a rolling quarter basis, because otherwise you're going to get a distorted picture of what's happening.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Andrew Wiechmann for closing remarks.
Andrew Wiechmann: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out if you do have additional questions. Always happy to engage with all of you. We look forward to keep you posted on our progress, and have a great day. Thank you so much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. Further instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Jay Penn, Interim Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Jay Penn - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good day and welcome to the MSCI first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter, which is available on our website, along with our earnings presentation and a first quarter update. A copy of the release, first quarter update, and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call contains forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risk and uncertainties, please see the Risk Factors and forward-looking statements disclaimer in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, organic operating revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insight into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measure in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures, on pages 21 to 27 of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run rate growth figures which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President; Andy Wiechmann, our Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Linda Huber, who will be joining MSCI as our new Chief Financial Officer officially this Monday, May 6. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I provide my comments for the quarter. I would like to take a minute and welcome Linda Huber to the MSCI family. As many of you know, Linda previously served as a Chief Financial Officer of Moody's Corporation for 13 years. We're very excited to have her join MSCI and help us continue to build this incredible franchise. I would also like to take a moment to thank Andy for his leadership within our finance organization and congratulate him for his appointment as our Chief Strategy Officer. 2019 is off to a great start. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of 10-plus percent organic subscription run rate growth, demonstrating the resiliency of our franchise and the strength of our business model. In Q1, we also hosted our first Investor Day in five years. It was a great success and we had a very significant turnout. I want to thank all of you that were able to join us. We appreciate your participation and your strong support. We had over 250 people join us in person or via webcast. We hosted this Investor Day to provide you with a deeper understanding of our key strategic initiatives, to highlight the achievement of our financial performance over the last several years, and to provide you with an update of our long-term financial outlook. This event also gave us the opportunity to highlight more succinctly who we are, how we view ourselves, what is the role that we play in the investment process, and what is it that we're building in this great franchise. Our mission at MSCI is to provide content and tools to help global investors build better portfolios for a better world. We are a provider of investment solutions designed to help institutional investors better understand both the market in which we operate and their portfolios. Through our unique data, analytical tools and research, investors can compare investments in a U.S. publicly traded stock, a high yield bond from an emerging market like Argentina, and an office tower in Japan as a way of an example. Therefore, investors can have a much better understanding how these seemingly disparate assets relate to their portfolio. Our solutions help investors evaluate their asset allocation and portfolio construction decisions, bringing increased transparency to the opaque and complex nature of their investments from all over the world. The Investor Day also gave us the chance to showcase several key areas of our company and our long-term growth potential, including our value proposition, which is built around actionable client solutions, differentiated content, and flexible technology. Our key pillars of our strategy, which include growing our core, executing on in-flight opportunities and capturing the next wave of opportunity, so that we can put additional layers of growth in our company. Our enormous growth potential in the market of professionally managed assets around the world, which currently stand around $100 trillion and we're only scratching the surface of servicing the owners and the managers of those assets. Our go-to strategy – our go-to-market strategy, an ability to provide solutions to our clients to help them make better investment decisions. Investor Day also allows to illustrate key industry trends that are creating enormous opportunities for us, including the growth of global investing whether it's develop markets, or emerging markets, or different asset classes; the increase in passive management of assets; the incorporation and integration of factors and ESG into their investment processes; the need for investment differentiation and operational efficiency of our clients; and of course, the shift of the asset allocation towards private assets, including private equity, private real estate. These are just a few of the trends that are propelling our growth in the company. Finally, on Investor Day, we updated our long-term company target, which includes low double-digit revenue growth, excluding asset-based fees, which obviously vary depending on the market cycle; high single-digit adjusted EBITDA expense growth; mid-teens adjusted EBITDA growth; and mid-to-high 50s adjusted EBITDA margin rate. These financial targets underscore our belief in the significant opportunities in front of us at MSCI, and our confidence in our ability to generate long-term growth for the benefit of our clients and for the benefit of creating shareholder value. If you did not get a chance to join us during the Investor Day, please listen to the replay of the webcast, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. In summary, our franchise remains incredibly strong as evidence to the performance that we had in Q1. And we feel confident of our prospects in 2019 and beyond. With that introduction and a review of what we covered in Investor Day to remind us all of what we did and where we are and where we're headed, let me now turn the call over to Baer.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Henry. I'm pleased to share with you some key accomplishments from the first quarter. The long-term trends we have discussed in the past are all creating opportunities for us. These trends include the continued globalization of investments with investors shifting from a strong home bias to diversified global portfolios, increasing allocations to private assets, and the need for greater transparency in these markets, as well as a growing focus on sustainable and factor investing. Investments we are making in technology, such as our analytics platform, which we recently branded as Beon, will further enable the use of all of our MSCI content to help clients build portfolios and understand the drivers of risk and performance. We also continue building out our capabilities in content in areas like fixed income. We now have industry-leading researchers and differentiated content which we continue to expand and complement with platform enhancements. These capabilities have been instrumental in fueling some of our largest analytics transactions and can be seen by the 8% organic subscription run rate growth for multi-asset class analytics. And these capabilities, together with investments we have made in areas like ES&G, have been instrumental in helping us win some recent large transactions with global asset owners. In fact, we have one of our best quarters for sales within the asset owners segment in the first quarter of 2019. Organic subscription run rate growth was 13% for asset owners in the first quarter. Growth within asset owners was fueled both by investors taking a much more proactive role in monitoring externally managed portfolios as well as directly managing portfolios themselves. Our wins in the first quarter were the result of our continued focus on developing and deepening our relationships and engagement with large asset owners. In the first quarter, several asset owners selected MSCI to deliver indexes designed to help them achieve specific investment objectives. As an example, a client added minimum volatility equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes to a U.S. portfolio to help lower its overall volatility with a plan to allocate to other factor ETFs over time. An endowment (00:12:03) used an MSCI ACWI ex-Fossil Fuels, ex-coal generation custom index to benchmark an allocation to a climate change strategy. A major plan seeking to simplify reporting selected the MSCI ACWI Index for a policy benchmark, which previously was a combination of Russell 1000, Russell 2000, MSCI EAFE World EM and EAFE Small Cap. Our indexes were also selected by a client to manage a longstanding divestment policy on tobacco, using the MSCI USA ESG Universal ex-Tobacco and the MSCI World ex-USA ES&G Universal ex-Tobacco indexes for two passive mandates totaling $375 million. Finally, I'd like to highlight our regional growth. In the first quarter, Asia was our fastest-growing region, reinforcing the emphasis we put on Asia at our Investor Day. Organic subscription run rate growth in Asia was 13%. We had several notable wins in Asia in the first quarter of 2019, including one asset owner with well over $100 billion in assets, who enhanced its risk management capabilities and developed deeper performance and risk insights using MSCI products and services. This client selected our multi-class analytics to help them better understand exposures, run scenario analyses, and position its portfolios in the face of volatile markets. Overall, we're very pleased with our consistent execution. I look forward to providing further updates on future calls. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy to provide some financial highlights. Andy?
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. As Baer and Henry highlighted, this was a strong quarter that highlighted our continued success in executing our strategy. The double-digit organic subscription run rate growth in the quarter was driven by strength across all regions. The Americas were up 9%, EMEA was up 11%, and Asia up 13%. Asset owners and asset managers, which together comprise about two-thirds of our subscription run rate, had organic subscription run rate growth of 13% and 10%, respectively. More broadly, many of the areas where we are seeing the strongest momentum are areas where we have been investing over the past couple of years. Areas such as ESG, wealth and Asia all have run rate growth rates above 12%. While continuing to fund and expand these long-term opportunities remains a top priority, we're also looking to add layers of growth for the future. For example, in real estate, we continue to develop our enterprise analytics platform. This platform is allowing clients to more easily access and interact with our real estate benchmarks, analytics and market information, as well as to much more easily contribute their proprietary data which underlies those tools. We also continue to invest in data science capabilities. In addition to driving productivity and operating leverage across the firm, these capabilities are enhancing the breadth, richness and quality of our content across areas like analytics models and our ESG Research. Additionally, recurring subscription sales and net new recurring subscription sales were quite strong for the first quarter, up 16% and 34%, respectively, as we were successful in closing a number of deals in the pipeline. As you know, timing of deals can lead to some lumpiness in net new quarter to quarter. Overall, the business landscape looks solid and our subscription business remains on track. AUM and equity ETFs linked to our indexes are touching all-time highs, driven by healthy cash inflows and favorable market movements. Of the $28 billion of inflows during the quarter, about a third or $9 billion came from funds based on U.S. exposure indexes. That represented over 100% of all flows into U.S. exposure ETFs during the quarter. Much of these flows into U.S. exposure products was in the ETFs based on our Factor Indexes, where we witnessed strong flows into low volatility and quality products. Overall, we saw close to $12 billion of flows into ETFs based on our Factor and ESG Indexes. Now, before we open the line to questions, I wanted to draw your attention to a few points, including some comments on our guidance for the year. Given the strong business landscape, the strong momentum we are seeing in key growth areas and the elevated levels of AUM and equity ETFs linked to our indexes relative to where we were at the beginning of the year, we plan to capitalize on some of the attractive growth opportunities in front of us and plan to make some modest incremental investments. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA expenses to be toward the top end of the guidance range of $685 million to $705 million. We believe these are high-returning investment areas and will continue to fuel the long-term growth of the company. I want to underscore that long-term positive operating leverage remains important to us. Overall, our guidance reflects our disciplined approach to improving productivity and becoming more efficient, while still funding investments. It's an approach that's paid off over the last few years with high subscription growth rates and margin expansion. With regards to our tax rate guidance, based on the $67 million income tax windfall benefit related to the vesting in the first quarter of the multi-year PSUs granted to certain executives in 2016, we are lowering our full year 2019 effective tax rate guidance to be between 9% and 12%. This benefit from multi-year PSU awards represents a full-year benefit of approximately 11 percentage points and will be excluded from adjusted EPS. Excluding this benefit, we expect the effective tax rate used for our adjusted EPS to be more in the range of 20% to 23%. Lastly, I want to comment on one reporting update. We've historically posted the prior month's end AUM and average monthly AUM in ETFs linked to our indexes on our Investor Relations homepage on the second business day of the month. For the April figures, we will be posting the information on or about May 15th. We've recently made some changes to the data vendors we used to track this data, and as a precaution, we are allowing for sufficient time for testing and transitioning of the data to ensure it meets our quality standards. With that, we will now open the line to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. First, congratulations Linda and Andy, on the new roles. Andy, you just mentioned that you're going to be at the higher end of the expense guidance because you're investing in some of the opportunities, and you mentioned a lot of those opportunities at the Investor Day. Just wanted to get a sense of which ones in specific that you're most excited about that you're going to be spending the incremental money on versus where you originally expected? Thanks.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Hi, Toni. It's Baer here. So, these are all previously prioritized investments that we feel strongly about and we've discussed previously. The three main buckets we're going to be putting some incremental money in are ES&G, fixed income, and our technology investments, notably in our platform, in Beon. So, those are the main areas we're focused on at present.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. And then, separately, in ESG, we're hearing all the time about companies trying to get into that area just given the fast growth in the market. And Moody's, for example, recently acquired a majority stake in a provider of ESG research and assessments and, basically, wants to create standards in ESG, and I know you're already doing that. So I just wanted to get a sense of if you're feeling like the market's getting more competitive. I imagine that your being a first-mover really helps, but just want to understand a little bit better the competitive environment and your differentiation from competitors and sustainability of growth in that area. So, thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Yes, Toni. So, clearly, MSCI is the leader here in this space, and we want to continue to drive for that leadership in terms of, clearly, investments and revenue growth and profitability of this product line. A major area of differentiation that MSCI is trying to bring to this market is to have an integrated, comprehensive product line for sustainable investing, from the research that is needed for investors to screen or exclude different type of investments to the ESG ratings. We currently rate about 15,000 issuers around the world and counting. The ESG indices that can serve as the basis for portfolios of equity or fixed income instruments, and also the ESG as factors in our equity and multi-asset class risk models to understand risk and performance and portfolio given ESG characteristics. And lastly, to be able to put all of that content, all of that ESG content in our analytics platform, especially Beon, the new branded analytics platform. So, that's an area of significant differentiation, but obviously to drive that leadership and to drive that growth that we have experienced, we need to be at the forefront of security coverage, of having client coverage personnel participating in conferences and the like. And there, to do – put a lot of new technology in terms of data science and the newer technologies of AI and machine-learnings to capture a lot more data for the input into ratings. So that is the reason why we are stepping up a bit the investment in ESG going forward.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: And Toni, you probably noticed, but the ESG run rate growth remains very healthy, both on the – what we call ESG content side or the rating side, as well as on the index side. And so, on the ESG ratings or Research side, or the content side, run rate growth, ex-FX was the mid-20%; and then, on the ESG Index side, 43%. And notably, among ESG Index subscriptions, the run rate growth was 53%. And we saw pretty strong health across geographies and particular strength in Asia, along the lines of Baer's comments earlier.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may proceed.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Hey. Hello, everyone. Wanted to shift gears quickly to the analytics side. I think at the Investor Day, that was one of the most aggressive increases in your medium-term guidance. But when I look at the quarter, and I know it's one quarter, but I think the subscription growth, it was fine, it wasn't great. But maybe just put that in context, what you're seeing out there, and what the environment is like for analytics, and where that really can ramp as you go through the year.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Alex. Baer, here. So look, I think we've been pretty consistent in how we've talked about analytics over the last number of years, which is that we would expect to see a continued increase and a steady increase in the growth rate, which I think we've delivered. So, that fundamental message hasn't altered. I think the climate in which we're operating is the same as it was a quarter ago. So, I don't think you should read too much into this quarter. I think the strategic message is the same. I think we're confident that our investments are paying off whether they be in technology for analytics or in fixed income, as an example. So, the thesis is the same, a steady, continued growth, and the market opportunities, including in the comments I just made a few moments ago, we're very confident about them.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Fair enough. But maybe staying on that business, just a couple of follow-ups. One, on the expense side, I mean, it seems like the expenses in analytics have been pretty a range-bound. So, that's a little bit surprising. Is that an area – you didn't highlight it as an area of increased spending. Now, some of the stuff like fixed income is in there. But just wondering if that needs to be a step-up that will surprise us? And then, just secondly, real quick, on the pricing side in analytics, some discussions we've been having seem to suggest that you're getting maybe a little bit more aggressive in that business on pricing. Anything you can flesh out on pricing in that business will be helpful too. Thanks.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure. Okay. So, on the first point, for sure, of the three categories I mentioned, ES&G, fixed income and Beon technology, two out of the three are linked to analytics. Equally, we're for sure not planning any surprises on expense growth. We've been extremely disciplined for quite a number of years on analytics expense growth, so you should not expect any surprises there. And equally, on pricing, I think we have – probably, starting closer to 18 months ago or so, we started to be more, how shall I put it, direct on looking at those clients where we felt we were delivering more value than we were being paid for, and we've been kind of cleaning that up steadily over time, and I expect that to continue. But, again, it's not a seismic change type of thing. It's just a continuation of the strategy, which we have been communicating now for a few years.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may proceed.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about your thoughts on sort of the competitive landscape on the analytics side. Obviously, there was one acquisition of note in the last couple of months. But just curious how you guys would characterize that field today?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, some of the M&A activity in this space has confirmed finally that the strategy that MSCI created some 15 years ago at the time of the acquisition of Barra and then subsequently through the acquisition of RiskMetrics is being copied by many other players in the marketplace. So, therefore, it's a good testament that what we started to build many, many years ago is working well and that is the convergence that is taking place in the world. Secondly, we have a relatively large, large lead in working through that strategy of integrating content of indices, content of analytics, such as factors, for example in equity or fixed income, content obviously in ESG, and then delivering that through either analytics solutions or through index solutions; think of them as portfolio solutions to our clients. So, we have quite a lead and we intend to remain the leader in the marketplace, even though obviously there will be more actors in the space and there will be more competition. We believe that this is going to be a big business, made up of bigger companies as opposed to the nichey small players in the marketplace. And we welcome competition, makes everyone good, and we intend to win in the context of that competitive landscape.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And just in terms of your latest thoughts on how active you guys are in terms of your own M&A pipeline. Obviously, in terms of all these other alternative areas you're growing in, there must be a bunch of niche things you could add on. So, I was just curious if you could update us on where you guys stand there.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, we see pretty much everything that is up there for sale, and we engage in some deeper due diligence in some and not in others. Everything that we want to do has to have a very strong strategic logic that is an extension of what we do rather than go sort of greenfield; and secondly, and extremely importantly, has to be predicated on very strong financial returns. And given the frothiness of the markets right now, given the heat in this space and the willingness of players to throw a lot of money at incredible valuations with what we believe to be relatively low or negative financial returns, we are happy to stand out and let them take those companies. And the other thing about MSCI is that we really don't have to do a lot of the things. And so, a lot of these incremental acquisitions are really optional. So, we'll continue to look and see what we find, but it's got to be grounded on very strong strategic logic and a strong financial return.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Got it. Thanks a lot.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Manav, the only point I would add on that is – and we've talked about this in the past, inorganic growth through partnerships continues to be an attractive area for us. And so, we are spending an increasing amount of time working with some of those technology and unique content providers as you alluded to as a way to enhance everything we do today and broaden what we do today. So, it's not always about owning outright or controlling some of these properties to get access to some of the key capabilities.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Andy.
Operator: And our next question comes from Hugh Miller with Buckingham. You may proceed.
Hugh Miller - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start one on – as we think about the free cash flow of the business, obviously, very strong, the equity position that you're currently at right now and the stock's valuation where it is now, how do we think about kind of the appetite for share buybacks in the near term?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes. So, as we have repeatedly say for quite a number of years, we, one, believe that the long-term prospects of MSCI are enormous and, therefore, the potential for high valuations remains there. On a more short-term and tactical basis, we are opportunistic buyers of our stock, not because we don't see value here and there, it's just we will rather buy on weakness than on richness, and we have proven that that formula has worked. Last year, we bought $950 million or so at an average price of $1.47. We did a little bit at the very, very beginning of this quarter, $102 million at an average price of $1.48. So, we're going to be patient buyers of our stock and pounce when others are fearful, and stand out when others are greedy.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Hugh, the only other variable to factor in here is our cash position, which on the heels of all the repurchases that Henry alluded to, plus the first quarter, which is always a light cash flow quarter for us. Our cash balances come down to somewhere in the $650 million range, which means we have a more modest amount of cash; still a meaningful amount, but not as much as we used to. And so, we can be a little bit more opportunistic.
Hugh Miller - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Sure. Very fair point. I appreciate the color there. And then, I guess as a follow up, as we think about kind of the advances that you're making with MSCI Beon, how do we think about kind of the monetization of that enhancement? Is that primarily a driver of kind of the ability to increase prices or is this more of an increased adoption within current clients as you get more people potentially using the platform and the product, or just like a new client penetration just with the stronger platform?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Well, for sure, it's a large opportunity with our existing clients. So, as you know, many of our clients use a variety of our content and applications, and bring these together through many of their internal tools. And Beon will significantly improve the user experience and the flexibility in that regard. So, we think that with our existing clients, there's a lot of upside. Equally, the tool, the product will create a very attractive user experience, which we think will win new clients to MSCI and we're seeing some early evidence of that as well. So, I think really what it is, is it's an enhancement to our overall analytics strategy for existing and new clients, and also a very attractive distribution tool for all of our MSCI content.
Hugh Miller - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And just a quick follow up, if I may, is there a timeframe that we should be thinking about in terms of the broad roll out of that?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Well, this year we're rolling out the product for equities and have a pretty aggressive timeline for getting the full range of MSCI equity functionality on to the platform. And starting next year, the multi-asset class capabilities will start to be rolled out. And so, that's really kind of the plan; equities this year; multi-asset class, next year; and from that way forward.
Hugh Miller - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Henry Chien with BMO. You may proceed.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning, guys. I just had a question on some of the trends that you're seeing on ESG. I mean, it sounds like there is a – if I'm thinking about it correctly, there's a sense of in-sourcing from the asset owners as well as growth in the wealth manager side. I was just wondering if you could just describe a little bit more how MSCI fits into this new world of ESG. Is it just index data or are you taking more of an active role in the investments?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, we are clearly early in the process of sustainable investing in the world. At MSCI, we believe that over a period of time, all of these sustainable investment processes will become totally part of the mainstream process. So, it will converge or blur ESG sustainable investing into the mainstream investing, so that there will come a point in which investing already will capture sustainable investing in addition to, think of it as, financial investing or only looking at financial metrics of investing, right? So, secondly, MSCI is a clear leader in providing research, guidance, tools of all types from research for exclusion, or to ratings, to indices, risk models, and all delivered in various platform of MSCI, plus other platforms in the world. We intend to be all over this opportunity. We think it's a very significant one. At MSCI, we have the organizational structure, we have the technology, we have the data science. A big part of all of this is capturing the right data, not only company reported data, but a lot of data from all over the world, unstructured or structured data. So, the scalability of this product line is something that we're very focused on and very confident about. And lastly, we are called upon by asset owners and asset managers all over the world to help them think through this thing, to help them figure out how an asset owner should incorporate this. They're not going to do it rating by rating. They're not speaking stocks. So, that's more of a portfolio decision. So, this is where indices come in. Active managers are trying to incorporate this in a day-to-day stock or bond picking process. So, we work with them on that. Risk managers are trying to understand how to manage risk in their portfolio. So, this is where the ESG and factor model comes in, and all of that. So, I could tell you that five years ago, maybe 10%, 15% of my dialogue with senior clients was ESG. Today, I always have to leave the ESG discussion to the second half of the meeting, because if I start with that, that's all we're going to talk about it the whole meeting.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. You may proceed. If you have yourself on a mute, please unmute your line.
Chris Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey guys, can you hear me?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes, we can hear you, Chris.
Chris Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Sorry about that. At Investor Day, you mentioned asset managers centralizing their procurement efforts around indices and analytics products. What inning do you think that centralization trend is in and how should we think about the pros and cons of a centralized procurement for MSCI?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Look, I think we're a good part of the way there just purely from like the administrative point of view. So, I would say that in the last number of years, we've seen that – well, that centralized procurement has always existed to a degree. It's been strengthened in the last number of years. And I think we're pretty much there. I think there are relatively few firms where just investment teams make those decisions on their own, at least within larger asset managers. So, I think it's well-established. I think we're comfortable in dealing with it. So, in that sense, I don't think it's a change which will have much of a material impact going forward. It's kind of an established pattern that we're working with.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, we also, Chris, anticipated this trend from four or five years ago. As you may remember, we said in Investor Day and other forum, we have built the MSCI and all the product lines largely on the basis of a subject matter expert at MSCI talking to the user at the client or the active manager, and then the user going up the hierarchy to get approval of the budget for them to buy the product or the service. So, that's how we've built it and we've done very well with that process and we'll continue to do well. But about four or five years ago, we anticipated this change – this pressure on the business model of active managers, obviously, because we were in that part. We were part of the entity putting the pressure on the – given our passive activities. So, we developed this top-down approach of covering the client in addition to the bottom-up with the senior account managers going to people like Baer, and myself, Laurent Seyer going to the CEO and the CIOs, and the CROs, so that we can capture the part of that budget that is no longer controlled by the users or the middle manager. A lot of the budget in these active managers organizations that are being centralized are being determined in terms of their allocation by the C-level people. So, we need to have a seat at the table as to how that gets allocated and for MSCI to help them spend their money right .
Chris Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then, you mentioned incremental investment in fixed income. Just maybe a little bit more detail there will be helpful. Thanks.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure. So it's quite – relatively straightforward. So, we have been really enhancing a lot of our modeling in fixed income, for example, in modeling in asset-backed securities and other areas of that kind. We're putting more investments also into fixed income indexes, notably Factor Indexes. There's actually an overlap with the ESG as we're doing a lot of rating of fixed income instruments and issuers in ESG. So, those are some of the main buckets of fixed-income investing that we're doing okay.
Chris Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone. So, the Q1 net subscription sales, very strong and combined with the favorable cancellation rate gave you a very impressive net new, up 34%. And that's particularly strong for Q1. And I wanted to ask if there was a pull-forward of some demand there or whether that strength is something that we can expect to continue for the next few quarters.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Bill, as you know, Q1 of 2018 was relatively light. And generally, Q1s tend to be pretty light for us. And so, that gave us, firstly, a relatively easy comp on the growth rate. To your point, timing of sales, particularly some of the larger ones, as well as cancels on the net new side can have a factor in any given quarter. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we were successful in this quarter in closing a lot of the deals in our pipeline. And so, I'd say – my broad comments would be, quarter-to-quarter, as you've seen in the past, sales and cancels tend to be a little bit lumpy.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: What I would add to Andy's comment is that if you notice the trend at MSCI over the last few years is we are doing more with the largest asset managers and largest asset owners and banks in the world. Secondly, our sales have gotten to a higher median of price – not price, but of total value, for sure, in analytics, a bit; and increasingly so in Index and in ESG. So, therefore, if that trend continues, in which we're doing a lot more with the biggest clients of the world which have deep pockets and we're selling them more things at much higher total dollar amounts relative to the base of sales, whether – if we put $5 million into one quarter at the end versus the $5 million that goes into the next quarter, as an example, is going to determine whether it's incredibly strong quarter or an average quarter. So, we want to stress over and over again to you that there will be lumpiness in quarter-to-quarter, more so – a little more so than in the past. We want to be very open and transparent with you as to how we see the pipeline and whether there's something to worry about, or something that is weakening, or something that is strengthening, so that you look at the thing on a aggregated version of a few quarters at a time, at rolling quarters. Because if not, you're going to take a strong quarter and extrapolate that we're knocking the cover off the ball, and you're going to take an average quarter and say things are slowing down and that may end up being the wrong conclusions.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. For my follow-up question, you'd highlighted ESG wealth in Asia as area that's growing above 12% organically. And I wanted to ask specifically about the wealth management segment there. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the pipeline of opportunities there. And it had been a place where you were investing in technology, and had you gotten your systems to the point where you feel you can and are winning net new business there with new clients?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure. So, I think most of the wealth sales that we're seeing are very much content-led, which is in Index, in ES&G and other areas. And including – I would say that if we're using our definition, which we've been consistent about content in analytics being our models and those type of capabilities, that's really what's continuing to drive our wealth growth. So, at present, we're not in the process of designing a wealth specific new application or product in that sense. But we do think that in addition to enriching all of our content, we will have both, one, in investments, in client coverage, which are extremely important. We've invested, for example, in client coverage of wealth in EMEA, in Europe, to mirror what we've done successfully in the U.S. And we also think that our new platform will give us openings into wealth going forward.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: And just so, you have the stats, Bill, because I know we've given them in the past, the index subscription run rate to the wealth segment was 22%. And within ESG, it's in the high 20%. And so, we continue to get some very strong momentum in those key content areas within the wealth segment.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Well, thank you very much, and also congratulations to Linda and Andy on the new role.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Bill.
Linda S. Huber - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed.
Drew Kootman - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. Just one question for me. I was wondering if you could talk about any shift you're seeing in the demand environment. Obviously, with a lot of volatility in Q4 and then the strong market rebound in Q1, just to get any kind of sense you guys have about AUM shifting and what you expect moving forward.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, let me address the overall market environment and then Andy can provide a little more granularity on the AUM and ETF, right? So, on the market environment, we made a conscious decision in the second half of last year that going into 2019 we did not believe that the world was going to continue to slow down dramatically, or go into recession, and that the market environment was going to be bad. So, therefore, we created a budget that was – an operating plan that was proactive in order to capitalize on a lot of the opportunities in 2019. We obviously have what we call an upturn playbook and a downturn playbook. The downturn playbook means that if things get bad, we have a lot of levers to slow down investments and, therefore, slow down EBITDA expenses. And in an upturn environment, we have a plan, very explicit plan, which Baer alluded to, which is we can add a small amount of incremental investment to capitalize on those opportunities. So far it's playing out exactly as we said. The correction in the fourth quarter was a completely overreaction by the market. We took advantage of that in our buyback. We kept our budget and our operating plan in place. The market environment is pretty benign to us. It's not galloping up or anything like that, but it's good. And therefore, we want to continue to capitalize on that and you see that in the subscription run rate – the organic subscription run rate. Now, the ETF, obviously, there is a lot shifting back and forth. But, Andy, you want to provide some comments on the ETF, AUM?
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. I would just highlight, firstly, before I touch on the AUM, the retention rate in the quarter, you probably saw, was 95.2%, which is close to the – if not the lowest rate we've had in a first quarter. And so, I think that's reflective of kind of the environment that we're seeing or at least the demand for our tools. On the AUM side, clearly, you saw that, over the last quarter, the AUM has gone up for us over $100 billion. $28 billion of that was from inflows. And so, we definitely benefited from market appreciation. But the inflows look pretty healthy from our perspective. That $28 billion was about 70% of all the inflows during the quarter into ETFs. I think a lot of that was driven by – as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we definitely saw some strength into ESG and factor products as well as U.S. exposure products, particularly our factor U.S. exposure products. We also saw, of that $28 billion, about $15 billion went into emerging market exposure ETFs, and the bulk of that was in the broad emerging market products. And that came from both U.S. and European listed products. So I think part of the benefit was a little bit of a rotation back into emerging markets, which naturally we benefit from. But I think a lot of it was idiosyncratic to us based on some of the newer high growth areas like factors and ESG.
Drew Kootman - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may proceed.
Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC: Thank you. My first question, the subscription part of your business within index is up a very strong 12.8% year-over-year. Can you just break apart for us the volume component of that versus pricing year-over-year?
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, I'd say it's very consistent with what we've seen in the past. So, about a third roughly or even less than a third of the growth is coming from price increases, but we continue to fuel that growth mainly through volume. And so, we continue to see strong health in the key areas of growth for us. So, I mentioned already the subscription run rate growth from ESG indexes of 53%. For our factor – index factor module, it's 40%; our custom modules, 19%. And so, these have continued to be key growth areas for us. I'd say, from a client segment standpoint, we are continuing to get strong traction in some of these new or I'd say higher growth client segments like wealth and asset owners, where among wealth managers, as I alluded to, 22% subscription run rate growth; and asset owners, at 27%. And so, those are areas that we continue to see a long runway of growth and continue to fuel – keep that elevated subscription run rate growth.
Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC: Then my follow-up question on the cost side of things. How would you categorize the labor market right now in terms of wage inflation out there? I know when you're out in the marketplace trying to hire all these high-end, well-educated folks. But is there any extra upward pressure on wages you have to pay to attract folks, anything out of the ordinary here?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Not really. We, at MSCI, benefit enormously by the global footprint of operations that we have. We have offices in 21 countries. As you saw in the reported material, we already are at 62% of our total employee base in emerging market centers from 59% at this time last year. So, we clearly are in a competitive market, but we can shift where we locate people in a lot of different locations and make sure that we extract the best talent possible. So, that has not changed that much, even though, in the U.S., which is – remember, we only have about 700-and-change, maybe 750 people in the U.S. compared to over 3,100 people that we have globally.
Operator: And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. You may proceed.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good morning. Congratulations, Andy and Linda. First question has to do regarding, I guess, the retention rate being as good as it is, understanding that MSCI has done a lot of things to make yourselves more important to the customer. But are we also seeing a stabilization in the overall market?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. I think that the retention rate on index has always been very strong and we're trying to take steps to make it even stronger, right? ESG, the retention rate was fairly high. And as the run rate grows on ESG, it's obviously going to not be as high, but within a high definition, right, similar to index, for example. On analytics, a lot of the efforts that we have put in place in the last 18 months have been to significantly increase our servicing capabilities to the client. Our analytics product line is made up of a lot of content that needs to be understood how to use that content, and then the technology that enables that content. Think of them as the platform, the technology, our applications platform that enable that content. So, what we have found is that a lot of clients have this incredibly sophisticated content and tools, but they're only using a small part of it. And that sometimes when it leads to cancellation, so we have a strong push in helping clients understand how they can use it more broadly, deeper in their organization, and that will mitigate cancel. Now, having said all of that, renewal rates and cancels will be lumpy, particularly in analytics. There will be some quarters that is going to appear a little higher, and there's some quarters that are going to appear a little lower. And we will endeavor to tell you whether you worry about – we should worry about or not worry about, but it is important not to extrapolate on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It's always better to take two, three quarters in aggregate and see where the trend is going.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question, the tax rate for the quarter was obviously really low, even outside of the stock option units. Is there any drivers of that? And I guess, do we – I believe that the guys take them (00:59:05) down a little bit on the top side for the rest of the year. I guess, what's driving the tax rate, I guess, lower than expectations?
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. It was almost entirely driven by the windfall benefits we saw in the first quarter on the vesting of stock-based compensation. So even outside of the multi-year award vesting which we're excluding from the adjusted EPS tax rate, the normal course stock-based compensation windfall benefit was higher than what we've seen in the past, largely driven by just the strong stock price performance. So, it was close to $10 million of windfall benefit that we saw outside of that multi-year benefit.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our Q&A portion of today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jay Penn for any closing remarks.
Jay Penn - MSCI, Inc.: So, Henry's going to actually...
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. I would just like to conclude by saying that you probably noticed that we've put in not only the slides in the website, but we've also put in a first quarter update that – few pages that goes over a review of the strategy that we went through Investor Day and I did a little bit of that in my comments, some of the client wins and where things stands on the client side, some of the product introductions that we did in the quarter, and a little bit on the inside MSCI, internally, what are the things that we're working on and that are salient to the quarter. We did that in an effort to limit the prepared remarks so that you could read them ahead of time and then we can spend a lot more time on Q&A. We'll like to continue to push that envelope further in order to allow for a lot more discussion and a lot more answer to your questions as opposed to all of us sitting in a conference call reading the prepared remarks. So please give us a lot of feedback into that, what works for you, what doesn't, and like to make sure that we calibrate this correctly. Back over to you, Jay.
Jay Penn - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Henry. Just want to thank everyone for joining the call today. Really appreciate the continued support and look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI fourth Quarter and Full-year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. Further instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Wiechmann, Head of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Andrew Wiechmann: Thank you, Victor. Good day, everyone. Welcome to the MSCI fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier in this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018. A copy of the release and the Slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second Slide of today's presentation. For discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to results presented on the basis of US GAAP, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to financial measures, excluding the impact of foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide insights into our core operating performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures on pages 23 to 27 of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes of foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry A. Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, everyone for joining us today. I hope that you are all staying warm in this frigid weather. The volatility of the US market over the last several months gave us the opportunity to demonstrate the resiliency of our diversified business model and the effectiveness of our capital allocation strategy, all of which have shown tremendous strength. I would like to spend a few minutes shedding some light on how we have managed through this recent market volatility. First and very importantly, across almost all areas over MSCI, we have seen little to no impact.  Despite the elevated market uncertainty, we have seen continuous trends in the selling environment across client segments with no noticeable changes to client behavior, which is reflected by the fact that we drove our second highest quarter ever of both recurring sales and recurring net new sales as well as our highest quarter ever for index sales and one-time sales. In addition, we witnessed relatively low cancels and our highest Q4 retention rate ever, coupled with the strong payment behavior from our clients, which accelerated our receivables collection efforts and generated record free cash flow.  This strength and resiliency was fairly consistent across all regions of the world in which we operate. Even though, many international markets have been in a sustained period of market pullback and volatility for as long as 10-months.  Furthermore, after relatively soft cash inflows in Q3, we have seen fairly healthy inflows in Q4 into ETFs linked to MSCI indices. There has been about $31.7 billion of total inflows since Q3 through last Friday, January 25. AUM equity aimed equity ETFs linked to our indices are now back to over $740 billion. On the other hand, this volatile environment has put tremendous pressure on the evaluation of ETFs linked to our indices. In Q4 we saw nearly 95 billion of negative market movement on the level of AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI indices, which was driven by the market sell-off and compounded by the appreciation in the US dollar. Conversely, we saw tremendous volumes in listed futures and options contracts based on our indices. With a 27% growth quarter-over-quarter in contract volume. As we have indicated in the past, this is an area of significant focus by MSCI and tremendous potential.  On a particular note, our continued discipline on the capital front, including the opportunistic financing transaction we did in May and the modest level of repurchases during the benign environment earlier in the year allowed us to take full advantage of the recent volatility and repurchased $755 million of shares since the beginning of October and through January 25th. This is a clear demonstration of the confidence and belief that we have in our business model and the franchise of our company. Well, we are only about 4 months into this period of market choppiness in the U.S. Let us remind ourselves the developed markets outside of the U.S. and for sure emerging markets have been under significant pressure for most of 2018.  Our recent successes highlight the outstanding resiliency of our business model and our franchise the differentiate and mission critical nature of our solutions as well as the strong secular tailwinds that are propelling many parts of our business. The MSCI franchise remains incredibly strong and getting stronger. The Q1 pipeline looks pretty healthy. The rest of the year pipeline also looks pretty healthy, and we feel confident about our prospects in 2019. We all look forward to providing additional insights and perspectives into the strength of our franchise and the significant opportunities ahead of us during our Investor Day on Thursday, February 28th. Let me turn the call over to Baer now, to talk some more about how we are executing and how we are continuing to fund that significant growth of opportunities that we have. Baer?
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. I am pleased to share with you some key accomplishments we achieved in Q4, driven by the consistent execution of our strategy and supported by our diversified business for all weather franchise.  A large focus for us over the last several years has been enhancing our internal capital allocation processes to allow us to effectively allocate resources and ensure we are concentrated on high-return growth initiatives, increasing speed to market with new products, enhancements to existing products, and improvements in our technology. We have established the systems and processes to rigorously measure and track our investments. Which has enabled us to drive growth by allocating our resources to the most strategic and highest return areas. We have focused on driving efficiencies and scalability in our cost base, utilizing the most recent technologies and continuous expansion of our emerging market talent base. Additionally, we have been expanding the portion of our expenses allocated to growth initiatives affording us the ability to enhance our value proposition and provide our clients with the right tools to manage their portfolios during these volatile times. We have been keen on ensuring that we have a balanced portfolio of short-term high return projects as well as longer-term strategic bets that will fuel growth in different markets and time horizons. The success we have had on this front is clearly evidence within index in the most recent quarter, where we delivered a 11.4% subscription run rate growth, 16.9% growth in recurring sales for the fourth quarter, and 18.5% for the full-year. This quarter marked the 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit subscription run-rate growth.  Our growth is increasingly fuelled by the areas we have been investing at. In the fourth quarter, the subscription run-rate growth of our ESNG factor custom and specialized index modules was 20% and sales of these modules represented approximately 30% of new sales for the full-year, compared to 19% for 2015, showing our ability to generate new sales within the index segment. Similarly, $12 billion or close to half of the Q4 in flows into the ETFs based on our indexes or into funds based on our factor at ESNG indexes. Furthermore, 30% of total sales for full-year 2018 were to wealth managers and broker-dealers as compared to 23% of sales and full-year 2015 helping drive some acceleration in the subscription run-rate growth. All of these index areas are benefiting from the resources of the entire MSCI franchise, and these key growth areas were built through very deliberate in targeted investments in new content, the build out of our client coverage team across new client segments, geographies, and use cases, and proactive engagement with our clients and industry participants. Enhancements and investments to our data and technology infrastructure were required and have enabled continuous improvements to quality accessibility and scalability. With continued investments in areas such as ESNG research and factor analytics, our index offerings have been the clear beneficiary of our strategic bets across multiple products segments. Some of our recent key launches and client wins highlight the success we are seeing in these new areas.  During 2018, we launched a significant number of new products, including new thematic indexes that allow investors to get exposure to trends such as cyber security, robotics, the aging society, and efficient energy, a wide range of additional ESNG products , new data modules, such as our USA module targeting specific exposures. The MSCI had a well 30 index as well as several China Index series, and our factor classification standard and factor box, which has already been adopted by 50 clients. In addition to these product launches, we continue to enhance our data and technology delivery model with improvements to our index production capabilities and the release of an important API that improves access to our content and which is fully integrated into our analytics platform. This continual evolution and reinvention is not unique to index, and it has been a key driver of the strong growth we are seeing across all parts of the business. I look forward to providing further updates on future calls. With that I turn the call over to Kathleen.
Kathleen Winters: Thanks Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. I will start on Slide 6. We had a very strong Q4 in finish to the year resulting in 2018 full-year revenue growth of 12.5%, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of over 200 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 34%.  In Q4, we delivered solid results across all of our key metrics. Recurring subscription revenue grew 9% in the quarter, ex the impact of FX and 12% ex the impact of FX and divestitures, driven by continued strength in index and ESG up 11% and 32% respectively.  As we continue to see particular strength across our newer modules such as custom and factor index modules and the increasing adoption of the ESG into the investment process across client types, geographies, and asset classes.  ABF revenue grew 4% and was driven by the strong cash inflows into ETF based on our indexes, growth in the AUM and non-ETF passive funds, particularly from higher fee products and increases in the volume of, exchange-traded futures and options contracts linked to our indexes. This was slightly offset by declines in market levels of the AUM and equity ETF linked to our indexes and a decline in the average basis point fee year-over-year resulting primarily from product mix. Our 2018 expenses were in line with our expectations and guidance.  We continue to take a very disciplined approach to expenses and prioritizing investments. Our Q4 expenses reflect our normal run the business type spend as well as additional discretionary activities we executed in the quarter to better position us for 2019.  This includes about $5 million of severance, which is more than double our quarterly average. We took actions to optimize our organization and streamline as well as reallocate resources in our client coverage team to better serve some of our fastest growing client segments such as wealth management. We also made strategic investments in our IT infrastructure and marketing activities.  We upgraded parts of our IT infrastructure and migrated legacy systems to newer and more advanced technologies to increase productivity. These investments are expected to yield benefits in 2019 such as faster time to market with new product features and increased back-office productivity. Excluding these discretionary investments and incremental severance, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA expense growth compared to Q4 2017 would have been about 4.8% excluding the impact of FX. Moving to Slide 7, let me highlight the key drivers of our adjusted EPS growth. Growth in our core subscription business continues to be driven by exceptionally strong sales and elevated retention rate, and we have not seen any changes to our clients' buying behavior. Adjusted EPS also benefited from the lower share count as we ramped up our repurchase activity to take advantage of the volatility in our share price. Now, let's turn to our segment results on Slide 9. Starting with our index segment, subscription revenue growth was driven by strong demand across all of our sub products, particularly for our custom and specialized indexes and factor and ESG indexes as we see a growing number of investment institutions using indexes as the basis of their investment strategies as well as well as the increasingly mainstream adoption of ESG and factor considerations within portfolio construction. Our analytics segment grew 4% excluding the impact of FX and 10% excluding the impact of FX and the divestiture of our IF & FEA businesses.  A key driver of this growth was due to the strength in multi-asset class and equity analytics as well as a large number of client implementations that were completed in the quarter. Additionally, we are very excited about the momentum we continue to see in multi-asset class solutions sales with strong demand for our risk and liquidity analytics, as clients are increasingly focused on sophisticated risk management.  In our all other segments, the growth was heavily driven by our ESG ratings, a direct result of our investments in this area. We also continue to make strides in our real estate product segment,00 enhancing client experiences with our new enterprise analytics offering, improvements in data quality, and a new client on-boarding process. Real estate revenue was up 19% versus the prior year excluding the impact of FX. Slide 10 provides a summary of our key operating metrics by segment. Organic subscription run-rate growth was strong across all major client segments and regions; asset owners and asset managers, which together contributed about two-thirds of our subscription run rate were each up 9%. In index, subscription run-rate crossed the $500 million mark for the first time and was up 11%.  This growth was driven by demand for custom and specialized modules with run rates growing 22% and 13% respectively. Also, run rates for factor and ESG modules grew by 47% and 48% respectively, as a growing number of clients and client types continue to incorporate factor and ESG considerations into their investment processes. Within the index subscription run rate, our largest client segment asset managers grew 10% as we help them measure performance with broader and enhanced content. We have also had great success with asset owners and wealth managers with subscription run rate growth of 28% and 22% respectively. We continue to drive adoption of our indexes as benchmarks and our indexes are increasingly being used to develop investment strategies. Index recorded at highest quarterly recurring sales ever in 2018 was the first time we had two quarters with recurring sales of more than $20 million resulting in a 19% full-year sales growth. Within analytics, run-rate growth was driven by strength in both multi-asset class and equity products, up 7% and 6% respectively on inorganic basis.  Our strength in multi-asset risk and factor analytics coupled with our research-driven content have been a tremendous competitive advantage for us as we close new business. We saw some of the fastest growth with asset managers our largest client segments in analytics , up 7% organically, asset managers well under tremendous industry pressures are turning to our solutions to help them with their risk management and portfolio construction efforts and to drive overall efficiencies within their organizations. Recurring net new for analytics have the second largest quarter in the last decade but was down year-over-year given Q4 2017's record quarter with several large deals closing. Our pipeline remains healthy, and retention remained strong at 93%. On Slide 11, we provide an update on Factors and ESG. In ESG over 50% of new sales in 2018 was driven by new clients to ESG. We have also seen great success with up-selling content to existing clients. ESG demand was strong in Q4 across all client segments and geographic regions, was 21% and 16% subscription run-rate growth in our largest segments, asset managers and asset owners respectively. In factors, AUM in equity ETF linked to MSCI factor indexes grew to $83 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven in part by increasing usage by wealth management firms. Turning to Slide 12, we highlight the drivers of our asset-based fees in more detail. Overall, growth in ABF revenue has been moderate in the last few quarters. On a full-year basis, we have seen market depreciation reduce AUM in equity ETFs linked to our indexes by 110 billion, driven by a decline in the emerging and developed markets outside the U.S., while cash flows increased AUM by 62 billion. I'll cover this in more detail shortly. In non-ETF passives, our strong institutional investor relationships and coverage efforts are driving a growing number of mandates tied to indexes.  In futures and options, run rate broke through $20 million in Q4, and we are excited about the increasing volumes as we work with key partners to drive demand and improve liquidity. We remain confident in the long-term growth prospects in equity ETF. In 2018, we licensed our indexes for 141 new equity ETFs, 79 of which are based on our factor and ESG indexes. Total AUM of these equity ETFs linked to our factor and ESG indexes have grown by 18% versus prior year, bringing the total to $106 billion as of December 31. While favorable long-term secular trends remain intact, we expect headwinds on ABF revenues in first half of 2019 compared to 2018 due to significantly higher equity values last year. In Q4, we saw average basis point fees increase sequentially by 0.02 basis points, primarily due to mix. Although, we saw a modest increase in average basis point fees as a result of strong flows into international exposure in factor funds coupled by market declines in U.S. exposure products. We continue to expect lower fee products to capture a disproportionate share of new flows into equity ETFs.  We expect a further decline in our average basis point fee levels as part of our efforts to capture volume and achieved continued run-rate growth. Our ETF partners are continually evaluating their market opportunities for existing and new products as well as the optimal positioning and pricing of those products. As such, we have discussions with all of our key partners about our fees and fee constructs on an ongoing basis. Now, let's turn to Slide 13, where we provide some additional detail on quarterly and yearly net cash flows. Across the global ETF landscape, there was about 400 billion in net inflows into equity ETFs in 2018, down nearly 20% compared to 2017. Earlier this year, investors favored the U.S. markets, particularly in Q2 and Q3; this shifted in Q4 with flows moving back into emerging and developed markets outside the U.S.  We benefited from the shift and flows in Q4 and saw significant increase in cash inflows into equity ETFs linked to our indexes. Equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes are well diversified across strategies and geographies. About 47% of these ETFs have exposure to developed markets outside the U.S., about 30% to emerging markets and the remainder exposed to the U.S. market. We continue to see strength across equity ETFs linked to our indexes and factors and ESG, which contributed to the strong cash inflows that we saw in the quarter and for the full-year. In 2018, equity ETFs linked to our factor indexes captured roughly 38% of the market's cash inflows into factor ETFs; Well, equity ETFs linked to our ESG indexes captured over 80% of the inflows into ESG ETFs. We remain confident in our strength in the market and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the long-term trends toward index-based investing. Turning to the next session, we provide an update on our capital liquidity and 2019 guidance. On Slide 15, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. In 2018, we repurchased about 6.2 million shares at an average price of about a $148 for a total of $925 million. Since 2012, we have returned nearly four billion of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Turning to Slide 16, let me provide you with our 2019 guidance. I would like to first remind everyone about the vesting in Q1 of the multiyear PSU awards granted to our executives in 2016 that we discussed on our Q3 Earnings Call. These awards will clip best(ph) in Q1 and while the award is accrued over the performance period which is between Q1 2016 and Q1 2019.  There will be a related payroll tax upon vesting offset by substantial income tax windfall benefit. The actual impact will be dependent on the share price over the measurement period end on the vesting date. Between the stock price of $140 per share to $170 per share, the payroll tax impact is expected to be between $12 and $15 million. At this range of stock prices, we expect to benefit between 8.5% to 9.5% points to our effective tax rate, which is assumed in our ETR guidance of 11.5% to 14.5%. This vesting will also result in a net cash tax benefit in 2019. As discussed last quarter, we will be excluding the payroll tax expense as well as the income tax windfall benefit for these multi-year awards from our adjusted figures in 2019, given the uniqueness of the size of the grant. The dilutive impact of these shares is already accounted for in our diluted share count. Adjusted EBITDA expenses are expected to be in the range of 685 million to $705 million, an increase of 3% to 6% versus 2018. Please note that we expect our year-over-year expense growth rates versus 2018, to be slightly higher in the first half of 2019, primarily driven by the timing of investments and carryover impact of new hires made in the second half of 2018. Our guidance is a reflection of our balanced and disciplined approach to margin expansion and funding for growth. This approach has paid off as we have seen with higher subscription growth rates and substantial margin expansion over the last few years. We expect to continue to fund high return projects to accelerate top-line growth, and with possibly lower ABF growth in the near term, we may see a slower pace of margin expansion than we have seen over the last few years. Turning to free cash flow, some of our exceptional 2018 cash flow performance was driven by the lower collections at the tail end of 2017 as well as strong collections at the end of 2018. Our 2019 guidance therefore reflects the expected timing of cash collections and the cash tax benefit related to the vesting of the multiyear PSU awards granted in 2016. In summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for MSCI, delivering double-digit top-line growth, healthy margin expansion, record cash flows, and attractive return of capital. Our Q4 and full-year results demonstrate our track record of execution and our ability to deliver substantial shareholder value. Our disciplined approach to funding growth and managing capital have paid off, and we expect to continue to invest in high return projects to drive top-line growth in 2019 and beyond. We believe that the long-term market trends remain very favorable. We are confident in our long-term growth prospects, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, we will open the lines to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. You may begin.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe just start on the expense guide a little bit, will be helpful if you can flush this out a little bit more in terms of the puts and takes, how we should be expecting the year to trend. I guess what I'm really asking is, we have seen some of this volatility in the ABS fees, so what are the kind of opportunities to put back if you need to, if the markets work against you and what are you actually assuming right now in terms of the market performance, because clearly AUM is already up more than 6% year-to- date. So, just talk a little bit how you are thinking about expenses in a good or bad environment.
Henry Fernandez: Yes, so let me give you the general direction and Kathleen can comment more specifically on the numbers, if any. Look, I think first of all if we are - we continue to see enormous growth opportunities in our franchise in our business. We started [indiscernible] three years ago looking very heavily, and we found many, many more opportunities that we even expected and have been funding them and growing in them as you see, you know, evidenced in the top line growth. So, we want to continue to do that.  With respect to the outlook for this market, we expect 2019 to be with respect to the AUM or at least the passive management part of the AUM. Remember, AUM also has futures and options in there, but what is expected from the passive management part of the AUM, we expect the 2019 to be a flattish kind of year; put maybe be a slight amount of cash inflows going into ETFs and therefore - and the reason is because bear in mind that the developed markets outside of the U.S. and the emerging markets have already beaming highly depressed levels for a lot of 2018. Can they go lower? Sure, they can were lower, but we have estimated that at this point that, you know, they may not, you know, they may not correct much more than that. We do expect significant volatility in the U.S. market, but not a bear market, so we think that there will be a lot of volatility up and down, but not a sustained bear market. So that's what is embedded in our thoughts processes into conclusion of a flat or so, you know, market level with an increasing amount of inflows that they give you a little bit of a positive impact on AUM. Therefore, based on that, our projection and the guidance we are giving you on expenses is around those assumptions and since we don't assume that there will be either a U.S. bear market or a global bear market further than, you know, over the years outside of the U.S., we do not anticipate changing any of the expense numbers as a reaction to volatility in the markets.  Now, if, throughout the year, we see a change of those assumptions that is impacting our recession and a bear market is coming, we will wait a bit before we see total evidence of that and we will adjust our expenses. But for now, you should assume that that we are not, you know, that if there is up and down volatility per quarter, we will not be adjusting our expenses.
Kathleen Winters: Yes, so let me just add to that a little bit. It's really important question, Alex; so, thank you. You know, look at the somewhat more challenging planning environment than we had at this point in time last year, challenging planning in terms of more uncertainty in the market with potentially slowing global growth, but you know, as Henry we are very confident in the top-line growth opportunities that we have and so very focused on continuing to fund those growth opportunities.  I shared with you the expense guidance at 3% to 6%, and I think you are asking about kind of how you think about that during the course of the year and also how we can flex that up and down if needed. The 3% to 6%, think about it closer to the higher end of the guidance range in the first half of the year and closer to the lower end of the guidance range in the second half of the year. In terms of, you know, should conditions be different than we are expecting our planning right now, I mean flexibility is certainly the key here. We have got a strong franchise, but we certainly need to make sure we have the flexibility to go in either direction, either kind of ratcheting things up or down.  And on the downside, that's where our downturn playbook comes in, and we are ready; we are constantly looking at that and ready to go as needed. We have got lots of granularity and numerous, you know, a couple of different tiers of levers in the downturn playbook that we can go to.
Alex Kramm: All right, very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just secondly, Henry gave a lot of detail around the fourth quarter and the environment, and you know, I was actually positively surprised how good the sales performance was, but just curious if there was anything you could highlight that maybe wait a little bit, I mean clearly the fourth quarter was a - must have been somewhat of a tougher sales environment.  So, you know, did anything get pushed at all, were client discussions different? I saw the index retention was down just slightly, I mean almost hard to be negative on that, but like anything where you saw some sort of weakness or anything getting pushed or was it really almost the same as throughout the year.
Henry Fernandez: Really, Alex, it was very consistent. You know, so I think, the type of investments our clients are making with us are typically, you know, fairly infrastructural. They're not the type of thing that is affected by momentary market volatility. So, you know, we didn't see any changes in the normal pattern of business nor did we see evidence that people were freezing anything or anything of that kind. So, you know, very consistent with previous quarters, and you know, exactly as you see reflected in the numbers.
Alex Kramm: All right, very good. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may begin.
Manav Patnaik: Yes. Thank you. I guess I just wanted to hone in on the cost a little bit more. You know, I think you talked about - you know, you have I guess an ongoing space of expands and investments; on top of that, I don't know if you want to call that fixed cost, variable cost, just to address your kind of downturn playbook like what - can you have break out what those expenses, breakout into just to think about where the levels are, should you need to pull them?
Henry Fernandez: So I think the way we think about it internally has changed the business expanses versus run the business expanses, obviously change the business are investments, not just you know expenses versus run the business.  And what we have been able to achieve in the last three years or so is a significant squeezing of the run the business expenses and freeing up of resource to go into change the business. So when you look at our, you know, look at our - our new investment plans for 2019 compared to the prior year in the change the business is up also like 25% as an example. You know that - and we want to continue hammering that; you know, we want to operate as efficiently. We think we still have some ways to go there in creating technology and data sets internally to operate better; obviously, at some point, there are diminishing returns of that efficiency and productivity of running the business. But we keep at it in order to increase the amount of money that we put in the change the business and some of those initiatives are the ones you know, I mean we cannot spend enough on ESG in terms of the expansion of the equity universe of ESG, the continuation of the expansion in fixed income; we still have a lot of runway there.  We currently - ratings about 15,000 issuers between equity and fixed income and that's going into a significant number; above that we are - we are getting requests by clients to do ESG ratings in private equities and in real estate and so on and so forth, and so that's an area, obviously, factor investing.  We are getting requests for - in not only factor investing in indices but also in factor investing between, you know, - in combining factors on ESG into portfolios into market cap portfolios to sell them, so we have a lot of demand there and we need to fund that substantially. We are getting lot of demand on increasing - or accelerate our development of the MSCI analytics platform, which enables a lot of analytics content. We cannot, you know, - the demand there are pushing us hard into expand and that is more than we can do at the moment or that we can afford to put in there. So there is a tension there going on. We are doing exceedingly well in EMEA, even in the context of our troubled region if you want to think about it, actually EMEA is probably the best region of the world right now for us. We have reorganized dramatically our Asia-Pacific client organization with a lot of new leadership, a lot of new hires, so we are very hopeful that Asia, which was a high growth area could be an even higher growth area and the like, and therefore, I mean we are giving you - we are trying to strike a good balance between the expansion of the margin - the base of expansion of the margin and the funding for growth and all these opportunities that we did cover and that's why you know I want to note again, the comment that Kathleen made or -- comments in terms of the EBITDA expense guidance that we are giving you, which is probably higher in the first half of the year and lower in the range in the second half, but you know the - but we are really intend on not letting the margin expansion accelerate, so in a time in which the AUM goes up we have a lot of projects to fund for growth, obviously we are more focused on the AUM coming down and having a playbook there, but if it goes up unexpectedly, you know we are doing that because we need to fund this significant growth areas. So therefore, as Kathleen indicated you should continue to see a less of an acceleration in the pace of margin expansion.
Kathleen Winters: Just adding on to it a little bit. It's really, you know, really important what Henry mentioned in terms of, you know, we are working really hard to say how do we spend less in the - you know run the business type of spend, so that we can spend more in the change the business type spend. So we really have a great culture of continuous improvement and really kind of amping up the focus on eliminating waste from our process.  Right, so as we keep looking at what we do every day; we are constantly looking for opportunities to say, OK, how we automate this to drive productivity, whether it's front office or back office we are doing more and more automation, How do we find opportunities to stop doing things, so we continue to bring down the cost on the run the business side of the house and devoted and dedicated and reallocated to change the business.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it. So, maybe just a quick follow-up; the 25% increase in the change the business you talked about; would you say most of that was still in the ESG and factor. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, you know, what could be the next ESG expose.
Henry Fernandez: It's across. We were always running a balance, you know, a meaningful amount of factors a meaningful amounts of ESG, a meaningful amount is also, you know, the analytics platform that we are investing in. We are putting some money into Wealth Management, which is a rapidly growing client segment for a lot of people including us, and we are just on their waiting a lot of our growth there at the moment, we need to do a lot more overtime.  Real estate, that's a story that we haven't talked about; we will tell you more about in the Investor Day, but it is really coming nicely; and therefore, that is encouraging us to put a lot more effort into the private asset classes; to think about this way, we have built the MSCI of the public asset classes we want to build the MSCI of the private asset classes. So that's an area, so there are - there is a lot of that is happening in the company.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Toni Kaplan: Hi, good morning. How do you think about the active asset management environment over the next year. Do you see things getting harder for your clients, you have a lot of new products to help, you know, get them through challenging times and new products that could help them grow revenue, but at the same time, if it is a challenging environment, you know, budgets could tie-in or maybe it's harder to drive new sales, so just help us think about your outlook on active this year. Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: Sure. I think our, you know, I would say thematically our main focus is on helping our clients be more efficient; so a lot of our tools are helping both within the investment processes of our clients within their infrastructure and looking at the range of information, software, etc., that they use in their investment process and finding ways of making that more efficient and more streamlined.  So I think just about everything we do fits into that category, one way or another, but I think that that is the main approach that we are taking, and notably, we are doing that at more senior levels at our clients and we have done historically with the CIOs, the CEOs, et cetera.,  And working on that in a kind of a holistic manner. So, and I think then the other question is that it may be that a more volatile market while providing challenges and also create opportunities in active management and that's where a lot of our research, etc., comes into help our clients.
Toni Kaplan: Great. And you mentioned on the last call that you are investing in private asset class content. Can you talk about how you view the opportunity and maybe non-traditional areas over the next few years.
Henry Fernandez: Okay, you know, I think it was a clearly our question earlier, what is the next ESG or even bigger than that, and that is one of them, you know, private asset classes. As we know well, private asset classes, particularly the bulk of private asset classes is private real estate of private equities. I mean clearly we have private credit and infrastructure and other aspects but you know, private real estate and private equities are the lion's share around the world, and we are already in one of those which is private real estate; you know, that we haven't talked a lot about as we were reengineering that effort and we want to expand that dramatically.  We are trying to find ways into getting into private equities in a much bigger way obviously we occasionally see our clients using our risk models for our private equity investing; obviously, our asset owner clients take it into account in their multi-asset class risk.  So, you know, but we are looking into things organically and inorganically, and we believe that, you know, if you look at the global pension funds around the world on an aggregate basis, they have about 14% allocation into private asset classes; that number of a 10 year period can easily be 25% to 30%, and we want to be in that area.  Hopefully, many of our clients want to be in that area because that's where the management fees will be as well, but in order to for that location to be that big the industry needs to really - they need an MSCI to achieve that; they need pricing models, they need performance attribution, they need benchmarks, they need understanding of the markets, they need understandings of risk and that's what we want to provide.
Toni Kaplan: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair. You may begin.
Chris Shutler: Hey guys, good morning. Question, you are pretty frequently from investors is how can MSCI continue to post double-digit subscription growth particularly in index when your active manager clients, which represent a majority of the client base, are under pressure, so just too (ph) curious to get your perspective.
Henry Fernandez: I think the way to think about it is that, you know, when that question gets asked is people are sort of focused on one aspect of our index franchise, which is market capping, this is either developer or emerging markets and sometimes they focus on only one client segment in a particular region of the world, and they think that we need to sort of remind us is that this franchise is being an expanding in which we have a fast growing business in license in factor indices, you know, for our clients, our active management clients.  We have large overseas, you know, growth in ESG indices, so you should think of indices as basis of portfolios and therefore - unless we believe that the active management world will have less portfolios, less exposures to, you know, equities around the world, then there is an explosion of benchmark so to speak of underlying basis for building portfolios, you know, on delight. The other thing is that, you know, our job is to help clients build portfolios, you know, one way or another, whether it's a benchmark to actively bid it or a passive of all sorts, you know, whether it's Asia, Europe, the U.S., Latin America whatever. And whether it is ESG or factors or fixed income or equities or whatever and not, but what we are also doing is we rented the kitchen, we are going to clients and say we are building and this is based on this infrastructure, what are you building on and this is on their infrastructure for your own use.  So we have a little bit of money coming in that way, but we see that as a huge expansion of our franchise. So that's why this thing is a very multifaceted franchise that can benefit a lot of our clients and generate double-digit growth.
Chris Shutler: Okay thanks, Henry. And then how much of the index subscription growth in 2018 was kind of pricing related and how do you expect 2019 to compare.
Kathleen Winters: Yes, pricing has been pretty consistent if you look at the last couple of years 2016, 2017, 2018; it's been pretty consistent. New sales, it's about - quite around 25% to 30% of new sales each year so, Yes, we are seeing that as a consistent driver.
Chris Shutler: Okay, thanks, Kathleen. And lastly, on the free cash flow guidance 545 to 585, what do you assume for the ETF asset levels, it sounds like pretty, pretty flat average AUM at the midpoint, is that fair? And then what was the free cash flow guide be without any one timers or tax benefits?
Kathleen Winters: So the only one timers there would be the tax benefit. You know, it's large, but it's not a huge number. We had some pretty substantial good guys in 2018, right, and so that's why you are seeing a free cash flow guidance at the midpoint; it is about flat when you look 2018 to 2019. So in 2018, we had weaker 2017 cash that helped us in 2018. We also quite frankly made some really good process improvements and so DSO improved quite substantially in 2018, so I'm just not counting on that same level of change in DSO going into 2019.
Chris Shutler: Down the ETF side, Kathleen, pretty, pretty flat at the midpoint, sounds like --.
Henry Fernandez: Chris, we will follow-up with you offline and then.
Chris Shutler: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may begin.
William Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So, a question for you on the analytics piece that you referenced the tough comp, but I wanted to ask - the gross sales were down about 23%, the cancellations were better, and the net sales being down about 19%. Is there any change in the competitive environment, is it becoming more difficult to win clients, anything like that going on?
Kathleen Winters: Yes, so you know, I think you are looking at Q4 comparisons and again we had a couple of really big deals Q4 last year. probably better to look at longer time period than to just isolate a particular quarter. You know, it was about flat, a couple of percentage points year-over-year improvement in 2018, and importantly though really steady strong sales in Analytics each quarter during the course of 2018.
William Warmington: Yes. And maybe just in terms of some further qualitative observations. You know, we have been very consistent in what we are seeing, which is that steady increase in the run rate and also the - I would say the breadth of solutions we are bringing to clients is greater than it's ever been across different client types, different solutions, so we are very - you know, everything that we see today, we think that's just going to carry on. Got it. And then on the wealth management opportunity that you mentioned. Where is the product today versus where you feel you need it to be to compete effectively and what kind of investment do you need to make into that product-oriented distribution to really capitalize on the opportunity.
Henry Fernandez: So we are still at the very early stages of it, just summarizing, and we can talk some more on Investor Day is there are opportunities all over the place; you know, ESG, we license, one of the biggest wealth managers in the U.S. to put ESG ratings into the reports of their portfolios to clients. We see opportunities in index in order to build kind of model portfolios.  So if you find a wealth management firm becomes an MSCI shop, they use , our entire out sort of framework to make decisions about allocation of assets we use it in analytics in terms of providing, you know, we may not have the front-end in wealth management, but we feel all the calculations and all the risk associated with the platform that wealth management firms use, so it really is multifaceted and we are only getting started.
William Warmington: Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. I guess I wanted to review or ask about opportunities on the M&A front and anything you might be targeting. Obviously, the cash flow has been healthy and you have got some new initiatives ESG, fixed, factor, wealth, private that could move the dial. Are you looking at anything in those areas to the extent you can talk about it, and then how do you feel about M&A, given all the commentary around volatility.
Henry Fernandez: So we always look, you know, click carefully and intensely and have a draconian, discipline and obviously everything has been fairly frothy in the last two-three years. So we have done very little if anything we have been on the opposite side, selling non-strategic parts of our business. We are, you know, and obviously it's going to be very strategic and value added financially for us.  You know, we are ringing our hands a little bit that at some point if that volatility continues and increases, there may be certain things that may become more actionable and we will look at them and obviously make the right decisions at that time. So, with that increase in volatility you are mentioning, maybe opportunities present themselves, but it's too early to tell, right; we only had a few months of volatility.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. And you talked earlier about, I think it was five million of adjustments that you made which is the largest, I think you pointed out quite some time. Can you just talk about where those adjustments were being made and maybe strategically how they fit into the plans and where you really sort of reducing, I guess, efforts or investments. Thanks.
Kathleen Winters: Yes, so I think you are referring to the $5 million of severance in Q4, and it was somewhat kind of broad-based, but in particular, I would say it's, you know, for the most part some reductions in analytics and coverage and quite frankly in functions, so really just looking at every single part of the organization and looking at how we streamline and reorganize and reallocate resources to - in the most efficient we can.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Henry Shein from BMO. You may begin.
Henry Shein: Hey guys, just. Thanks. Just a question on sort of demand you are seeing for factor and ESG; it sounds like that has been quite robust despite the challenges that you spoke about - or some of the questions spoke about on the active side. I'm just curious how is - I guess at a high level, how is this data being use most as like an informative source or is there something going on in terms of this data being used in the investment process beyond just passive management.
Henry Fernandez: No, it's pretty fundamental. I mean on ESG, the way to think about it is sustainable investing in a shrinking world of information and demands for society about environmental controls and social norms on governance of companies, so the ESG is really across, you know, from exclusions, you know comp - a lot of investors don't want to invest in certain companies, so we have a big service to give them the list of those companies based on criteria to the ratings per company and issuers, you know bond issuers. you know to the creation of indices for the basis of portfolios, either active or passive and to the inclusion of ESG and risk factors to understand the risk of portfolios; unknown factors is similarly, you know, obviously the creation of factors portfolios for the ETF as an example, 70 plus billion dollars or I think 80 plus billion dollars of ETF right now at MSCI or more than 10% of the total AUM is on factors, and you know. The factors, you know one of the areas that we are focused on is how we have helped active managers incorporate factors in what they do and report to their clients; equity long-short hedge funds are being asked by their clients to report unknown factor lines as well and make investment decisions among factor lines; you know a lot of institutional asset owners have been allocating funds into factor passive allocations directly and we have been working with them and showing them the benchmarks as all across the board.
Henry Shein: Okay, got it. Okay that makes sense. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari, Macquarie Capital. You may begin.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on fee pressure versus volume trade-off; you mentioned that's favorable right now, but it is there a point where it becomes unfavorable either you are not willing to go below a certain margin or is it a basis points that we should look at; any thoughts as to, you know, you know when that trade-off changes. Is there any trigger for that or it's sort of just tough to have visibility there.
Henry Fernandez: I think we have been, you know, very consistent on this topic on the calls over time. You know, we have seen a, what we call natural pattern that has manifested itself in the numbers over time. We don't see anything that's really at all different, you know, this quarter. We have no evidence of that changing, so, really, it's just - I'm afraid just a repetition of what we said before; it's directional, it's steady, and we don't see any dramatic change in that right now.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And just a follow-up; in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned around investment spend certain bigger strategic bets. Would you size up what you consider large strategic bets and is M&A specifically part of that or were you just talking organic. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: I was referring to organic; at this point, M&A is totally sort of, you know, opportunistic; either it comes or it doesn't, so you cannot plan around it or talk about it that much organically. You know, look, we are on their funding, you know, the analytics platform that should be needed for the enabling of our content, so that's an area that will require more funding over time.  Given the request by clients, we could be spending a lot more on ESG in order to put more sales people to have more consultants with our clients to have more coverage of the universe is, as I said, we are getting to a good level of ESG ratings on equity issuers.  We are still low on the fixed income side; we need to ramp that up, and we are getting demand on private companies and on real estate assets and the likes, so that's a big opportunity that needs funding; you know the real estate itself needs funding, you know given that we are beginning to succeed there. So, there are lot of area funding on the geography, we're still not punching at the weight, that we want to punch in Asia, for example, that's a huge opportunity that we have done well but it could be a lot bigger and that's why I want to reiterate that we give you guidance this is what we plan to do. But over time, it is very important to recognize that the rate of growth of the EBITDA margin that we have seen in the last four-five years is going to decelerate because we see enormous growth opportunities; you know to fund that growth and the balance we are trying to strike is incremental growth or additional growth over and above what we are doing or expansion of margin. I think you will want us to do the former of goal for those opportunities on funding.
Hamzah Mazari: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. You may begin.
Craig Huber: Yes, good morning. I have a couple of questions, First wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on this impressive 9.7% organic growth you have in the analytics here. If you adjust for foreign exchange is obviously two to three times your historical growth rate in that area. Can you just flush out for us what you are doing differently there to help drive the growth at that level?
Baer Pettit: Sure. So, you know, one sort of long-term story or multi-year story is it has been, you know, enhancements in all of our analytics content, notably in fixed income, which has really created opportunities for us.  The other point I would make is related to the answer I gave to the active manager question which is, you know, we find that our clients have enormous need for better tools, greater efficiency in their infrastructure, removement of duplication, consistent way of looking at risk and return, et cetera.  So it's precisely to a degree at least this environment that can be challenging for asset managers and for other parts of the investment process that leads them to want to have high quality tools that are consistent across their firm, and this is really what is the main theme driving this growth.
Kathleen Winters: Yes, so let me just add on to what Baer was saying here. In addition to that, you may recall in the prepared comments, we mentioned that we had a lot of implementation coming to completion in the quarter, so that helped the revenue growth rate as well. So you can see, that's a little bit higher than the organic run rate, which has been running at about 7% for five quarters in a row now.
Craig Huber: Thank you for that. Also, if I could ask the cost growth sequentially in the index business up, you know, roughly $5 million, and it's pretty similar versus the first two quarters, you obviously severance was part of that; if you took out severance, how much would the index costs have been up versus the first, second, and third quarter.
Kathleen Winters: Yes, that's a little bit of - I don't have the specific number ex-severance, I mean, there's a little bit from severance, it’s really continued investment and funding for growth, particularly as we fund for product development and technology.
Craig Huber: Okay. My last question, I would like to sneak this in, historically --
Henry Fernandez: Actually, we apologize. Can you limit it to two questions, you know…
Craig Huber: Alright, guys. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: We will follow up with you, appreciate it.
Craig Huber: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. You may begin.
Keith Housum: Good afternoon, thanks for opportunity to ask question here. I'm just real quick in terms of the personnel. Over the past several years, you guys have taken advantage of the opportunity to move personnel from developed markets to emerging markets. Is there still opportunity there further or has that kind of played itself out.
Henry Fernandez: No, for sure we want to keep moving that higher. There is a point that oversee you start reaching diminishing returns. You still need - you know people in sales, for example, to be in front of clients in developed markets and the like. But as mentioned before in this efficiency and productivity drives inside the company to lower the cost of running the business, we are investing in data and technology internally to run the business and that would allow us to continue to increase the ratio into our into our talent centers in emerging markets. So there will be more of that but not on the same basis it was, you know, five years ago.
Keith Housum: Okay, thank you. And then Kathleen, this is a quick follow-up. In terms of the stock options you guys expect in the first quarter and net cash basis how much cash do you guys expect that's originate.
Kathleen Winters: Do you mean the vesting of the cash impact of the vesting.
Keith Housum: Correct. No the payroll taxes.
Kathleen Winters: Yes, as I said, you know, if you look at the you $140 to $170 share the payroll tax impact is about $12 to $15 million, but it's a net cash benefit when you include the tax benefit from the SBC windfall.
Keith Housum: All right, thank you.
Operator: Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller from Buckingham, you may begin.
Hugh Miller: Hi, I know your are running over time, so I will just be quick. First, just a housekeeping one wanted to confirm that you guys had mentioned in the prepared remarks that there is no change in the share count expected from the vesting of the PSUs for 2019.
Kathleen Winters: That's correct. It's already reflected in the diluted share count.
Hugh Miller: Yes. Great. And then the second question just on - you know as you think about kind of trying to get the analytics business up to the growth targets you have for the top line and the strategic investments you are making; you know, are we thinking about this or should we be thinking about this in terms of just slower margin growth on a go-forward basis or is there the potential that you could be accelerating growth, you know, and see compression in the near term in order to get that acceleration for that business.
Henry Fernandez: No, we for sure would like not to accelerate the margin, although it has been happening despite our efforts in order to fund the growth needed to increase the growth of product line significantly.
Hugh Miller: Got it.
Henry Fernandez: Just one clarification on your prior question. There will be a modest decline in the share count when those multi-year awards vest. We will withhold shares, and we issue the awards, and that those withholdings of shares will reduce the share counts lately.
Hugh Miller: Perfect, thanks for the clarification. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I would like to turn the call back to Andrew Wiechmann for closing remarks.
Andrew Wiechmann: Thank you all for joining us today. As always, please feel free to reach out with any additional questions. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress and look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day in a month. Thank you again and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. Further instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andy Wiechmann, Head of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Imani. Good day and welcome to the MSCI third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter 2018. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we've prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You're cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evaluation of results. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 22 to 26 of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me turn the call over to Henry Fernandez.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Andy, and good day everyone. The exceptional results from the third quarter, including the 11% growth in organic subscription run rate, reflect the power of MSCI franchise and highlight the growing importance of that franchise in an investment industry undergoing a significant transformation. We continue to benefit from favorable secular trends, particularly with the continued growth in global investing, utilizing passive strategies, adopting ESG and the factor criteria, and using risk management frameworks. On top of these secular trends, we have a very diversified business at MSCI, basically an all-weather franchise with natural hedges and in a wide range of market regimes. We benefit one way or another in any market where there is active or passive; risk on or risk off; high volatility or low volatility; developed or emerging market; U.S., Europe, or Asia; sustainable investing or not; asset owners, asset managers, or trading firms; strong dollar or weak dollar; high valuations when we sell businesses, like we've done in the last few months, or low when we buy them, hopefully someday in the future; high MSCI price, when we feel good, or low MSCI price, when we buy lots of shares. We basically have a franchise that capitalizes in most market environment. Let me now give you a few example from the clients' perspectives. In these volatile conditions, our clients are increasingly using our risk management tools to better understand their exposures, run scenario analysis, and position their portfolios for various market shocks. To gain insight into the drivers of performance and risk and to build portfolios in this volatile market environment, our clients are showing elevated interest in our factor analytics and factor indices. For investors that expect sustained economic growth with moderate inflation and gradually rising interest rates, our factor analytics and factor indices help them build portfolios around strategies that have performed well in these scenarios, such as growth, momentum, and progressing in all (5:09) sectors. Alternatively, investors that believe that trade wars, increasing inflation, and rising interest rates will hinder economic growth use our factor tools and factor indices to help them take advantage of strategies like minimum volatility, quality, value, high dividend yield, or defensive sectors. Given the weakness in emerging markets, our clients are showing a strong interest in all our emerging market content from indices to risk models to ESG. Our emerging market and single country risk factor models, including our recently released China Equity Model 6, help clients better understand the drivers of performance and risk in those markets. Recently, we are seeing a growing level of attention on companies that lack transparency, engage in socially unacceptable behavior, damage the environment, or are governed in ways not aligned with shareholder or constituent interest. This trend continues to drive and fuel the growth of all our ESG products and services. In summary, MSCI's strength is that we have tools to help the investment community in any market environment. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress and our future successes. We are hosting an Investor Day on February 28 of next year to provide deeper dive into the ongoing industry transformation and how MSCI is well position and has attractive growth opportunities in that transformation. Let me now turn the call over to Baer Pettit.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Henry. Our ability to help clients is reflected in both the strong product growth shown on slide 5, as well as by the double digit subscription run rate growth we are seeing across asset managers, asset owners, investment consultants, wealth managers, and broker dealers, which collectively represent more than 87% of our subscription run rate. As Henry mentioned, this success is amplified in the current market environment. But it is also being driven by our continued investment and strong execution in three key areas. One, expanding our research and content in order to remain at the forefront of providing insights into the latest investment trends; two, enhancing our go-to-market strategy in driving an integrated client solutions approach, including building out and enhancing the effectiveness of our global sales and client service organization; and three, delivering flexible cutting-edge technology, including our new platform. This consistent execution is allowing us to further differentiate ourselves relative to the competition. This has been particularly noticeable within Analytics. By delivering new content, improved platform functionality, and continual enhancements to our client engagement model, we have further differentiated our best-in-class offerings and our ability to deliver actionable solutions for our clients. These efforts have driven improvements in Analytics growth, as well as better positioned us to help clients in volatile environments. Among other enhancements in the third quarter, we introduced a new mortgage prepayment and rate model; as well as expansions of our fixed income, asset pricing, and benchmark curves; a new multi-asset class factor model suite with capabilities for strategic asset allocation; in addition to a new China equity model, adding increased insights into emerging markets; full integration of our ES&G content into all Analytics applications, allowing our clients to easily integrate ES&G ratings, data, and indexes into their security selection, portfolio construction, stress testing, and risk analysis. Additionally, a broad range of enhanced functionality across our Analytics platforms enables us to help our clients more effectively and efficiently achieve their investment objectives. These ongoing enhancements are improving our client value proposition and helping us secure new opportunities across a broader range of use cases. Here are a few examples from Analytics in the third quarter. Through our best-in-class content and strong client relationship, we won a large upsell with an existing U.S. asset manager to use our models and applications in order to run factor exposure analysis and stress testing for their global equities team. As a large and longstanding client of the firm, the client's internal risk system is already powered by our risk analytics API, and the client leverages our equity portfolio analytics. The additional license will enable them to stress test their equity portfolios in a way that is more helpful to the portfolio managers with factor shocks and historical stress analysis. In another example, we won a large new deal with the derivative structuring desk of a major European bank to use our risk analytics API to provide scenario analysis and risk analytics to holders of swaps issued by the firm, allowing them to offer differentiated insights to their derivatives clients. We won the deal through the breadth and uniqueness of our analytics capabilities and our ability to combine those in a way that helps the clients achieve their specific business objectives. Similarly, we won a significant contract with a very large Asian securities firm to license our WealthBench offering to help them transform their wealth business from a brokerage model to an advisory one by allowing 5,000 advisors across 155 branches to deliver tailored investment planning proposals to their clients. We won the deal because of our high touch service model, institutional quality analytics, and our ability to analyze a wide range of securities and a very large number of portfolios. Beyond Analytics, we continue to roll out new content and capabilities across the firm that position us to better help our clients. Here are a few further highlights from this quarter that illustrate our progress across product lines. We launched several new ES&G indexes, such as the MSCI ex Tobacco Involvement Indexes, which are designed for asset owners to standardize their divestments from companies involved in the tobacco business. And we launched our MSCI Real Estate Enterprise Analytics offering, an interactive application that provides real estate investors and managers with the ability to evaluate and analyze the drivers of their portfolio performance, as well as review exposures and concentrations across market asset types and segments. We remain excited about the wide range of opportunities in front of us. And I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress in creating more client and shareholder value. With that, I turn the call over to Kathleen.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll start on slide 6. Q3 was another quarter of great execution. Our disciplined approach to investment continues to yield strong results, as we delivered exceptional revenue and EPS growth as well as strong cash flows. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong momentum in our recurring subscription revenue, growing 10%, with continued strength in Index and ESG, up 12% and 34% respectively. ABF revenue, which comprises 23% of our total revenue, grew 13% and was driven by higher AUM of equity ETFs linked to our indexes and our non-ETF passive business. Average AUM in MSCI linked equity ETFs was up 16% from the same period last year, largely driven by strong cash inflows over the last 12 months. ABF revenue from non-ETF passive funds linked to MSCI indexes was up 21%, mainly driven by an increase of 15% in average AUMs. Moving to slide 7, you can see the key drivers of our adjusted earnings growth. Our subscription business was the largest driver. In addition to strong new sales, we continue to maintain a very high retention rate, 95% this quarter. EPS also benefited from a reduced corporate tax rate due to U.S. tax reform and, to a smaller extent, our tax restructuring work, which better aligns our tax profile with our global operating footprint. Now let's turn to our segment results on slide 9. Within the Index segment, we have strong subscription revenue growth, driven by our core market cap weighted products, as well as our custom and specialized Index products. We see our investments around new datasets and faster production paying off. For example, in recent quarters, we have developed and licensed numerous custom ESG and factor indexes for several large asset owners, which are being used for a wide range of uses, including as benchmarks for active mandates and for passive replication. Our Analytics segment grew 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the divestiture of our FEA business, largely driven by our focus on expanding use cases. Multi-asset class solutions contributed about two-thirds of the growth, driven mainly by demand for our risk and liquidity analytics toolsets. On July 30, we announced the divestiture of InvestorForce, which was subsequently completed on October 12. As a reminder, the run rate impacted about $17 million. In our All Other segment, the growth is mainly driven by ESG with run rate up 28% versus the prior year. We continue to see strong growth in EMEA and Asia-Pac with run rate growth of 32% and 61% respectively, as investors increasingly integrate ESG into their investment processes. Slide 10 provides a summary of our key operating metrics by segment. Organic subscription run rate growth continues to accelerate, up 11% with growth across all client segments. Asset owners and asset managers were up 13% and 11% respectively. In Index, we had strong growth in both asset base fees and subscription run rates, up 13% and 11% respectively. Asset based fees have benefited from licenses of our indexes for new equity ETFs and new asset owner mandates for passive funds. However, recent market volatility and particularly the market depreciation of emerging market equities was a drag on ABF growth rate in the quarter. Within the Index subscription run rate, newer modules continue to drive robust growth. Run rates for factor and ESG modules grew by 42% and 48% respectively. Custom and specialized modules have also performed very well, growing at 24% and 14% respectively, as clients are turning to MSCI to help them provide differentiated product offerings. Our largest client segment asset managers grew 9% in Index subscription run rate, as we continue to broaden and enhance our content. We've also had great success selling our Index content to asset owners and wealth managers with subscription run rate growth in these client segments of 24% and 28% respectively. Our ability to expand content has allowed us to capture new business across all client segments, as indexes are increasingly being used by clients to develop and reflect their investment strategies. Year to date, Index for current sales are up 19%. And the Q3 Index retention rate remains very strong at 96.1%. Within Analytics, our accelerating growth has been attributable to broader content and capabilities, new use cases, and our One MSCI go-to-market approach. The Analytics retention rate was 94.1%, compared to 93.4% prior year Q3. The recurring net new growth for Analytics was up 27% versus the prior year, benefiting from a large WealthBench win in Asia as Baer described earlier. On slide 11, we provide an update on two key areas of integrated content, factors and ESG. We continue to see strong client demand in both areas. In factors, AUM in equity ETF linked to MSCI factor indexes grew to $84 billion, up 40% year over year, driven in part by increasing usage by wealth management firms. In ESG, we passed a substantial milestone. Our ESG ratings and research run rate, combined with ESG index run rate in our Index segment, surpassed the $100 million mark, more than doubling in just three years. We see strong ESG demand across all client segments with 27% subscription run rate growth in our largest segments, asset managers and asset owners who are integrating ESG into their investment processes. We're also seeing wealth platforms and retail brokers building ESG focused model portfolios. New clients contributed about 60% of recurring sales in the quarter for ESG. We are accelerating our investment in ESG, as we continue to broaden our ratings coverage and incorporate broader datasets, including a wider range of alternative data points. Turning to slide 12, we highlight the drivers of our asset-based fees in more detail. In non-ETF passives, our strong institutional investor relationships are driving a growing number of mandates tied to indexes. And in futures and options, we're excited about the increasing volume, which is driving more liquidity. Year-to-date futures and options volume is up roughly 23% versus the prior year and run rate was up 21%. We believe revenue from these products have a long trajectory of growth ahead. Overall, growth in ABF revenue has been moderating the last couple of quarters. On a year-to-date basis through September 30, we've seen market depreciation reduce AUM in these equity ETFs by $16 billion, driven by the emerging and developed markets outside the U.S., while cash flows increased AUM by $37 billion. We remain confident in the long term growth prospects in equity ETFs, including factor and ESG ETFs. Year to date, we've licensed our indexes for 83 new equity ETFs, 51 of which are based on our factor and ESG indexes. Total AUM of these equity ETFs have grown by 11% sequentially, bringing the total to $108 billion as of September 30. While favorable long term secular trends remain intact, we do expect ABF run rate growth to continue to moderate in the near term, as AUM growth potentially remains constrained by market pressures. In Q3 we saw effective basis fees decline by 0.06 basis points. This was consistent with our expectations for continuing fee pressures and was primarily driven by a shift in product mix. We continue to expect lower fee products to capture a disproportionate share of new flows into equity ETFs. And we expect a further decline in our average basis point fee levels, as part of our efforts to capture volume and achieve continued run rate growth. Our ETF partners are continually evaluating their market opportunities for existing and new products, as well as the optimal positioning and pricing of those products. As such, we have discussions with all of our key ETF partners about our fees and fee constructs on an ongoing basis. Now let's turn to slide 13, where we provide some additional detail on quarterly net cash flows. Equity ETFs linked to MCI indexes are heavily diversified across strategies and geographies with about 22% exposure to the U.S. market and the remainder spread across emerging markets and developed markets outside of the U.S. Across the global ETF landscape in Q3 there was about $100 billion in net inflows into equity ETFs, up sequentially from the $60 billion in Q2. Investors continue to favor the U.S. with about 72% of Q3 flows going into U.S. exposure ETFs. Last quarter, about 80% of the flows went into U.S. equity ETFs. Outside of the U.S., cash flows into non-U.S. equity ETFs have been relatively muted with only about $28 billion in Q3. The overwhelming majority of these flows were into domestic equity ETFs, where the ETF exposure and the listing country is the same, pointing to investors concerned about investing in the global market. Now turning specifically to MSCI linked ETF flows, we experienced similar dynamics to the market. On a year-to-date basis, we've seen solid flows into equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes with U.S. exposure, capturing about 10% of total U.S. exposure equity flows, roughly in line with our share in this market. Equity ETFs based on our indexes in key growth areas, such as factor and ESG, continue to gain momentum. Equity ETFs based on our factor and ESG indexes on a combined basis captured 43% of cash flows into factor and ESG ETFs on a year-to-date basis. In Q4, we continue to see additional pressure on AUM levels, given broad market volatility. Despite the recent market headwinds, we remain confident in the long-term secular move to index based investing and our ETF provider licensing strategy to increase our market share through volume growth and drive long-term run rate growth. Turning to the next section, we provide an update on our capital, liquidity, 2018 guidance, and our 2019 planning framework. On slide 15, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. Our balance sheet remains strong, allowing flexibility and giving us the firepower to capitalize on the right opportunities at the right time. Having this flexibility will allow us to generate strong returns for our shareholders, as we evaluate the best uses for our cash. Year to date, we've repurchased about 2.6 million shares at an average price of about $151 a share for total value of $388 million. Turning to slide 16, we have some updates to our guidance. We're raising the bottom end of our operating and adjusted EBITDA expense target. In Q4 we expect some additional costs related to compensation, investments and marketing for our widely used indexes, and also severance, as we continue to optimize the organizational structure. Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $743 million to $750 million. And adjusted EBITDA expenses are expected to be in the range of $658 million to $665 million, likely coming in at the high end of those ranges. Before we get to our planning framework, I'd like to take a moment to highlight our substantial progress over the last three years and the alignment of our long-term compensation strategy with shareholder interests. Reflecting on the company's evolution, our strong financial results have been directly attributable to our focus on client needs, innovation, and the consistent execution of our strategy. We've delivered a nice acceleration in our growth rate, particularly in our recurring subscription business. We've improved our subscription run rate growth from an organic growth rate of 8% in 2015 to 11% this year. We believe that our all-weather franchise brings great value to our clients through different market cycles. We're well-positioned to serve a wide spectrum of investors in multiple client segments. Furthermore, we've been highly focused on driving efficiency and productivity gains to free up resources to enhance our products and further improve profitability. As a result, we've delivered a healthy rate of margin expansion. Finally, we're very focused on ensuring that capital is optimally deployed to enhance shareholder return. The market has recognized the company's success and has driven an increase of over $6 billion in shareholder value over the last three years. We're highlighting this value creation because of its significance and because it is aligned with the multiyear PSU awards granted to our executives in 2016. These awards were intended to align our executive compensation program with our three-year strategic plan and shareholder interests. The value is based on the achievement of a challenging multiyear TSR CAGR performance metric. This incentive has worked very well and will cliff vest in Q1 2019. While the award is accrued over the vesting period, that is Q1 2016 through Q1 2019, there will be a related payroll tax upon vesting in Q1 2019. This will be offset by an income tax windfall benefit driven by this vesting. The actual impact will be dependent on the share price over the measurement period and on the vesting date, but it is likely to be a net benefit. The multiyear PSUs granted in 2016 cover three years of the annual PSU component of long-term incentive compensation for senior executives. And therefore, these executives did not receive any PSU grants in 2017 or 2018. Given the uniqueness of the size of the grant, we will be excluding the payroll tax expense as well as the income tax windfall benefit from our adjusted figures in 2019. The dilutive impact of these shares are already accounted for in our diluted share count. Now let's turn to slide 18, so I can take you through how we're approaching 2019. We're currently working through our planning process. And we'll give you our 2019 guidance when we report Q4 2018 results. But in the meantime we wanted to provide you with some color around what we're seeing in the market and what we're doing to capitalize on these trends. We believe that market trends remain overall favorable. Globally, professionally managed assets continue to grow. Investors are focused on drivers of performance and risk, and the value generated by managers. Growth in index based investment also continues to be a key element and tailwind for our business, driving strong demand for our content and services. Investments we've made in these areas are paying off. And our subscription business continues to benefit from these trends. Our ABF revenues are also benefiting from these investments with strong growth in areas like factors and ESG, which continue to gain traction with investors and are increasingly becoming a key component of the investment decision process. However, ABF revenue may at times face near-term challenges, depending on flows and pricing. We expect to continue to invest in high return projects. We've improved our systems, processes, and culture, which has enabled us to quantitatively track and manage our investments and expense base to drive continued innovation, effective capital allocation, and enhanced return on investment and shareholder returns. Finally we continue to approach share repurchases in line with past practice, by repurchasing more shares when there is softness in the market and when we have more excess cash, and fewer shares when volatility is low and we have lower excess cash balances. In summary, our recurring subscription business continues to grow at a very healthy pace. We expect to continue to invest in areas around content, technology, and services to drive top line growth. Our results this quarter have demonstrated our consistent strategy and execution, which has resulted in robust shareholder returns. We're confident in our long-term growth prospects. And we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, we'll open the line to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. Wanted to start on the Index subscription side of the business. I think some of you, and I think Henry you as well, mentioned that there's been more interest in the U.S., and EM in particular struggled, I think non-U.S. developed as well. So I noted the – or I noticed the 3Q's nonrecurring subscription sales in Index being a little bit softer here. We're really flat with last year. So just wondering if those customers clearly are having a little bit of a harder time? At some of your core customers, is it harder to get pricing? Is there a – is the sales environment tougher? And in particular, what's the look into the fourth quarter, given that that environment continues to be pretty poor, and the fourth quarter is supposed to be a big sales quarter for you generally. Thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, Alex. No real change whatsoever on our clients with respect to Index subscriptions and interest in all the various categories. So our pipeline remains healthy. There is no abnormal situation one way or another. I think there are always timing considerations. And, Kathleen?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. No. Alex, thanks for the question. To your point, recurring sales being flat year over year, a couple things to kind of point out to kind of take that in context. Number one, prior year Q3 was fairly strong, so some of it is just related to comps year over year. But really importantly, Q2, remember, was a really high sales quarter. In fact, highest recurring sales ever, up 53%. So we had a really strong Q2. When you look at it over a longer period of time, rather than just discrete quarters, on a year-to-date basis, we feel really good about the performance of the Index product segment and particularly the subscription portion of that franchise. Recurring sales year to date are up 19%. All the regions look pretty good, particularly seeing great strength in EMEA and Asia-Pac. And in fact, our retention is very high at 96%. So when you look at it in the context of the full year performance, we feel pretty good about it.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. So no worries about the environment or the expected 4Q, big quarter usually in the fourth quarter I guess is what I'm hearing here.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Exactly. I mean nothing really. As Henry said, pipeline looks pretty good right now.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Then just shifting gears real quick on the expense side. I appreciate all the commentary. But you're clearly acknowledging the challenges on the ABF side. And it sounds like maybe next year there could be a little bit of a reaction if I heard you correctly. But I'm still a little bit surprised that you're getting rid of InvestorForce. Clearly, it's a tough environment. And you've been seeing that coming. And people have been asking about your expense flex. But now you're coming in at the higher end of the range it seems like. So maybe just flesh it out a little bit. I think some people would have hoped for a little bit more reaction quicker to what's going on in the marketplace.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So on InvestorForce and FEA, the commodity analytics business that we sold earlier in the year, the – it's an answer to we are dramatically always looking at our focus, our strategy. And anything that deviates from that strong focus on the strategy and doesn't belong will be sold. And especially in a very good high market valuations. So that's that one. On the overall sort of tone of the market and psychology of our clients, it's pretty robust. Clearly, there's been volatility around recently. But we haven't seen any issues or any cracks or any concerns or any worries that have been reflected in their budgets or in our sales to them or our dialogue to them at this point. So we remain cautiously optimistic about our continued success with those clients. Look, on the expense base and the rate of growth of expenses, our view – we kept expenses in the 5% to 6% expense growth range when revenues were only 200 basis points above that. Now that revenues are increasing, particularly subscription revenues, we want to deliver operating leverage. But we want to continue to invest in the business. Everything we do basically gets expensed, and therefore that will be reflected on a higher expense base and expense growth of the company. We do not want to – so let say if we were to grow substantially higher than we currently are growing on the top line, we do not want to widen the operating leverage of the company, given the huge opportunities we have available. We want to take advantage of that incremental growth to share it with shareholders. Part of that gets invested and therefore reflected in the EBITDA expense growth. And part of it gets dropped to the bottom line in operating leverage.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So just to add to that a little bit. As Henry alluded to, look, our priorities and focus continues to be driving strong top line growth and controlling expenses. But as Henry said, look, we've got some great opportunities here. And we're very confident in our ability to execute. We've got an excellent management team, our bets are paying off, and we've got a track record of high return projects that are paying off, factors, ESG, fixed income helping drive multi-asset class. So it makes sense that we kind of look at these high return projects and execute them as fast as we can. Now if you look at the kind of ramp up in the run rate in expense level, there are some non-recurring type things expected in the balance of the year, which I referenced, including some investment from the marketing side and particularly some severance, a little bit higher severance in Q4. So and we think that that's the smart thing to do to kind of optimize the cost structure as we go into 2019.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone. I was going to ask you about the Analytics business. Looks like the net new recurring subscription sales there are the strongest that we've seen so far this year. So if you could comment on that. And then also the – this is your fourth quarter of 7% organic growth in Analytics. And sort of with an outlook towards can you sustain that level?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for the question. So it is precisely because related to the question you're asking that we kind of put an emphasis on that in my comments, my – in the script. So we feel increasingly confident that we have built the basis of the ability to have steadily increasing growth. We have actually been relatively conservative in the way that we've communicated around that to you all. And we wanted to give some color as to the examples that are driving that. So this is very much what I would call the accretion of functionality, the accretion of client focus, which we continue to believe will deliver more value. So this is more of a steady story than a rapid change story. But everything that we're seeing in terms of our client relationships, our pipeline, and the nature of the analytics we're adding to the pipeline leads us to believe that this will continue in the right direction.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Sorry. Kathleen, I just wanted to follow up on that comment on the high return projects. And I think I fully appreciate that. I was wondering like outside of factors, ESG, fixed income, which obviously – the obvious ones, like what are some of the other ones in there that you guys are spending some of that money in?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So I think that, across each of our product lines we have significant opportunities. Kathleen in her comments I believe had referenced some of our custom index growth. We're investing in that infrastructure in the Index business. And in general our ability to deliver a range of different types of content, such as thematic indexes in the Index world. We have pretty significant investments in fixed income, which are cross product lines. So some of those are mostly focused in Analytics, where I reference them. Also some new initiatives in Index. We were investing in our platform in Analytics, which is initially building out for Analytics itself that segment. But as I referenced in my comments, it has positive impacts in things like ES&G, where that content is going forward. So I would say that within each of our product lines, we have some pretty attractive opportunities, many of which I think have been referenced over the calls in the last few quarters.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Okay, that's good to hear. And then just one other question from me. So with the cash balance you have, it sounds like maybe buybacks remains a key priority. But just curious like, what kind of deal would make you do M&A over a buyback?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: It will be a high return to the investment, to the capital outlay and a very strong strategic focus. And unfortunately, we're not seeing much of the former in terms of the properties that get sold are being sold at extremely high valuations. And therefore we sit it out. We're hoping that at some point, market conditions will create opportunities for us to see better returns and coupled with very strong strategic focus on what we do. But in the meantime, we spent a lot of time in last 12 months looking at our strategic focus and found these two areas. So the FEA, which is the commodities part, and the InvestorForce. And we had an opportunity to sell them to people that would make better benefit of it.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Right.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, good morning. On the guidance, it implies a sequential step up in adjusted EBITDA expense, sequentially I think of $6 million to $13 million. What are the top two – top one, two items driving that increase? And, Kathleen, can you quantify the one-time items that are in that implied Q4 expense guide?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So let me talk about Q4 first and then we can go into 2019. Yeah. I mean, we've got a little bit higher in terms of severance in Q4, a couple million dollars higher. And then some incremental investments, both technology and some marketing around our most widely used indexes. In terms of implications then for 2019, I mean when you think about the cost base and the ramp up, 2018 to 2019, it's really similar to what we've talked about in the past in that you think about the cost structure that we have and our cost base being primarily people and technology, and 60% of our census (44:29) being in emerging market, when you kind of think about that and layer on kind of year-over-year merit, if you will, and investments that we want to do in all of the areas that Baer just articulated, that's really the path when you think about a 2018 to 2019 walk.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: And we'll spend a bit more time on this on Investor Day. But it is very important to emphasize that we continue to be highly focused on a balance between continued margin expansion, which we want, we like, and investing in the business to capitalize on the significant opportunity that we have. And we'll create higher revenue growth. So it's a balancing out between the short term. We do not want to be milking the franchise at all. We want to be investing in the franchise. We have been doing that even in the face of major margin expansion the last three years. And obviously it's been rewarded by shareholders. That we plan to continue on that balancing out, not to – we're not planning to decline margins or anything like that. We want to continue margin expansion. But if we grow faster, we will increase EBITDA expenses faster. We will not keep them flat. And therefore it'll – based on the investment opportunities, I have a major margin expansion that will feels – make us all feel great, including me as a big shareholder of the company, but take away the value creation in years to come.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. As Henry said, look, it's a balancing act, right, because there are several things that are important to us in that we're absolutely focused on and obsessed with quite frankly. And that is strong top line growth and continuing the momentum and the trajectory there. Controlling expenses, while also being able to fund the really good investments that we have. And positive operating leverage over the long term. And just smart capital allocation, making sure we're using our capital and cash and putting it towards the best use all the time.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: And by the way, this is not a change of direction. We're not seeing really any change. This is what we've been doing for the last three years. Now we were more constrained in doing it when the rate of growth was lower, and therefore, we had to keep the rate of EBITDA growth lower than if we are growing faster. But we're committed to continue margin expansion at the same time as obviously investing for even higher growth in the company.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then regarding the three-year equity incentive plan, as it comes to a conclusion here in the near term, what should we expect the new incentive plan to look like, at least at a very high level? I'm curious if there will be a similarly heavy emphasis on total shareholder return for top execs.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, we like that huge alignment, me as a shareholder that happens to be the manager of the company, really like that complete alignment of shareholder interest and board interest and management interest in one objective, and that is to drive the share price higher. And therefore, whatever we end up doing in the next few years will be focused on TSR. There is obviously a little bit of a focus in RSUs that are time vested, are not sort of share price driven in order to dampen that volatility in some of the members of the middle management team of the company. But at top of the house, including me, it has to be driven by complete alignment with shareholders. So now the second question is, whether we end up doing a multiyear plan or an annual plan, I think it's – those are discussions that are going on with the board. We have – we want to align the incentive plan to the strategy. The last, the three-year plan, had the three-year front-loaded shares, were aligned to a three-year strategy that we agree with the board. And it was very effective. And we don't know yet if that's going to be similar, or it's going be annual grant. But whatever it is, it's got to be a high level of sort of a manager/shareholder interest and a high level of drive of alignment on share price.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Kathleen, in the past you've talked about the downturn playbook. And just given the volatility in the equity markets in October, did that trigger you to implement your downturn playbook? Is that what's driving the 4Q severance? Or basically is – are the severance actions more a normal course of business? Yeah, just any color on that.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, Toni, let me introduce the concept. And then Kathleen can comment on the specific numbers. The – what we have been doing in the company is in our constant strategy, trying to understand all of our opportunities to service clients and grow the franchise and therefore create more shareholder value. And in the process of doing that, we also review our organizational structure, our different management teams. Are they are in the right place, in the right seats, in the right locations? And all of that. And to the extent that we don't see a complete alignment on that, we are taking actions with changes on the organizational structure or changing of the individuals. So that's what's driving. This is not any different that we've done in prior years. There is always an undercurrent, an underlying amount of severance in every year. This quarter, fourth quarter, will be a little bit higher, because it just happened to a group, a lot of those changes. But that is the underlying driver and philosophy on all of this.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, that's right. And thank you. So, Toni, we're always looking at kind of the organizational structure, the cost structure, and always questioning, how we do things better, more efficiently? So there's always going to be a little bit of this sort of activity. It's a little bit elevated in Q4. But in response to your question about the downturn playbook and kind of let's think about that in terms of looking toward 2019. We are also always looking at that downturn playbook and how do we strengthen it? How do we modify it? How do we enhance it? And so as we think about that and we think about the possible scenarios and market conditions in 2019, it's very important to us that we kind of ensure that we are a nimble organization and able to kind of adjust up or adjust down from market condition. And so we're always kind of looking at and refining that downturn playbook and thinking about it in the context of, what are the things that are kind of self-adjusting costs and costs that don't impact top line growth? Versus the things that you want to go to last, in other words, pacing of investment. So that's kind of how we think about it. And we're always kind of looking at it and refreshing it to make sure we're ready to go.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: I would just add something else, given that there have been a few questions on this topic is, clearly, any kind of market volatility, any kind of global economic potential slowdown or trade wars or tensions, we need to be humble about them and the impact on them. But we want to stress to you, we are not seeing any changes to our business because of that. And on the contrary, part of us think that those things present significant opportunities to enhance our franchise. So we're not giving you an indication of, we're concerned, we have problems, or whatever. On the contrary, we feel that that's – those were the comments about the all-weather franchise. We feel that this presents major opportunities for our clients to use our products.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And just for my follow-up, I know this has been asked before in a couple different ways. But I just want to make sure I'm very clear on the message here. So the last time you had an Investor Day, there was a pretty significant investment ramp-up in expenses and basically lower margins as a result. And what I think I heard you say, Henry, is that now it's more that you're committed to expanding margins. There will be some investments, because you do have these growth opportunities. But we shouldn't really think of this as a repeat of 2014. Is that the right way to think about it?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Correct. It's not a repeat of 20 – whenever that was, 2014. It's to give you an update of how we're thinking. We haven't done one in a long time. Tell you how excited we are about the opportunities that we see ahead of us. How we can increase growth of the top line commensurate with those opportunities. And what are the investments that are required to achieve that in the content of an expanding margin?
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. I was wondering, can you talk about maybe a shift in the demand environment? Obviously with the more volatility in the market itself, maybe some of your products would be a little bit more relevant and some less relevant. Just trying to get a sense based on some of the shifting AUMs that we're expected to see and we have seen.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure, I'll make a few observations. As Henry said, clearly we don't have a crystal ball. We can't see the circumstances. And we're not complacent. But I think actually some of the examples that I gave of our most recent sales and the general direction of where we're headed is that most of what we do is infrastructural to our clients. It's not highly dependent on market levels. It is the way that they run their business. It's the content they use. It's the processes they use. It's the exposures they have. So having been through this now several times – we had difficult markets in 2000, 2001, 2002, clearly, the financial crisis. I feel quite confident that our products and the need for our products is very resilient in that context almost across the board. The clear exception is of course those things which are linked to market levels themselves, which will by definition come down linked to the market. And then I think the other element is clearly in a sustainably difficult environment, our clients will – there are two things occurred. There's just generally cost pressure, looking everywhere for cost. And at the margin, that puts a little pressure on us. But it's not the nature of the need. It's just the clients' push for efficiency. And then finally going even further, if consolidation in the industry accelerates, historically, we've found that our – major cause of our cancellations can be consolidation. But those are getting kind of well ahead of ourselves. I think the most – my bias would be from my view of this in the past and my current vantage point, that in the early period and in a short term correction, we would have a tendency to be seen to be resilient compared to what's going on in the rest of the market and maybe some of our competitors.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: And back to that point Baer, I mean we've looked at – we've looked back a decade and looked at the subscription growth each and every year during that time period. And it's been quite strong in every year.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. And then just one kind of question building on that. You talked about some of the trade-off of pricing for volumes, which I assume is market share. In the environment where there's more volatility, will you start to feel that pricing pressure on your core business? And in some of the newer initiatives, are those coming in at lower price rates? I'm just wondering as we look back historically, in those volatile markets does pricing become a larger issue? And in some of the areas you're switching to, is pricing coming in a bit lower again to gain market share? Thanks.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: So as a broad observation, across what we're doing generally, the pricing is not coming in lower is the headline, right? So our pricing power is generally consistent or even in various categories, as we've spoken before on some of these calls, our pricing power has increased notably in Analytics as an example. So my sense would be – and then if we go back historically, more of those things are linked to our competitive – I would say our competitive competencies at the time. So going back, let's say, a decade ago, we had some – quite a bit of pricing pressure on equity analytics, but that's because we weren't competitive enough in certain areas. So my sense is we're pretty strongly competitive in our main categories. I do think that a tougher market always leads to some price competition. But for sure we're not feeling that yet.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Henry Chien with BMO. Your line is now open.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about the wealth management opportunity. If I'm hearing correctly, it sounds like that was a meaningful sort of growth driver for the subscription – or Index subscription business. Is that sort of the case? And is the dynamic there similar to the active asset management space? And in terms of the adoption of passive?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And just any kind of color on what's going on there? Thanks.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure, yeah. So let me try to structure my observations in the following way. One, clearly the wealth segment is today significantly smaller for us than the asset management. Two, the growth rate is higher. It's, I think, I believe, our highest segment growth by client segment in the last quarter. We're investing more there. Many of the trends that we've seen in other segments, notably the growth of Index products, increasing risk management, and benchmarking, et cetera, are increasing. So our strategy is to continue to invest there. And our plan and hope would be that you will see sustained growth in that segment on the quarters going forward.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay, great. And just kind of following up to some of the prior questions. In sort of a more volatile environment, and I guess this is more of a high level question, are you seeing an impact in how your clients are thinking about the use of passives?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Not really.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Really?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: The volatility has been so short that it's a very, very short period. It hasn't affected structural behavior.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good afternoon. Thank you. My first question is just on productivity or efficiency, net of investment. I know you spoke a lot about incremental investment. But curious how you're thinking about productivity going forward in light of any initiatives, including One MSCI go-to-market? I know you highlighted $0.08 in the quarter. Just curious how we think about that number on a go forward basis?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, look, we are extremely focused on that. And the two examples there will be, when you look at our head count on the last one or two years, head count increase has been very modest relative to the sales and revenues of the company and the amount of innovation we've done. And then secondly, our – on the client coverage side, our productivity levels have actually increased probably about 20%, 25% in the last two, three years.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: And so just on...
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, great. And – sorry, go ahead.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, I can just add a little more color there in terms of how we look at it. I mean, look, the culture here is that we're very, very careful about spending levels and always scrutinizing productivity and efficiency. And you've seen us kind of make some great strides the last couple years in terms of leveraging some emerging market talent. And you'll see us continue to do those sorts of things.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And just a follow up question, I'll turn it over. Just on ESG, you talked about the business doubling in three years. How do you think about that growth rate going forward? I realize it's the law of large numbers. But is the market big enough for the business to double again in three years? Thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, we can't obviously speculate whether it's going to double or not, but the opportunity is huge.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good morning. Question regarding on the All Other (1:04:32) segment, following up the ESG question. Not much discussion of the real estate portion of that group. I wonder if you could add some color to that in terms of how it's performing? And what the expectations are going forward? Perhaps as you're really eyeing the cost structure here going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So that – clearly, the big driver of the Other segment right now is ESG, real estate beginning to have an uptick in terms of sales and profitability. But it's not yet in a position of making significant contributions to that segment. But we're hoping that – we're very optimistic that it will.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Got you. And then, Kathleen, just a little bit of housekeeping here. Interest income has obviously ticked up for you guys quite well over the past few quarters. Obviously you got an interest – a rising interest rate environment. And you guys have more cash on the balance sheet. But has there been a change to your philosophy in terms of your investments that's helping drive some of that interest income as well?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: No, it's really just the cash balances and just better execution on the – and yields that we're getting. No change in strategy there.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Okay. So just still going to see -what you see in this quarter and last quarter, we should still see that continuing?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yes.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Your line is now open.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi, just wanted some clarification on your previous comments in relation to timing considerations linked to Index sales. So can that be a function of the market environment at all, that as conditions worsen, that the signing get pushed out? Or it's just issues where a contract gets signed a few days late?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: No change with respect to the market environment. It's just simply the number of renewals that we've negotiated in the quarter gave you a little bit of overgrowth compared to the prior quarter and the future quarters. So it's just timing.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Got it. And with the stronger growth in sales more broadly in recent quarters, is there any pull forward perhaps from 4Q? Or should we continue to expect that nice bump from 3Q to 4Q?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, we can't – I mean we haven't done the call for Q4. So we can't be forecasting what's going to happen. So I think it's not appropriate for us to say in a call like this what will happen in Q4 at this point. Right? We'll – let's take you into the end of January.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon now I guess. For that ESG business, do you think of that as a benchmark type business with long term pricing power? Or as the business matures and more competitors come into the space, would you expect pricing to get more competitive over time?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Look, we're definitely trying to create the standards for measurement and investing in – according to ESG criteria, one hand. On the other hand, I'm not sure that there will be just one absolute standard to this. There may be a few competitors in the space. And whether that leads to pricing pressure or not, I don't think so. I mean a lot of our clients are following the MSCI kind of metrics. And we've had meaningful pricing power there. But right now we're very focused on penetration on that across the world.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then maybe a quick one for Kathleen. Just within the asset base fees, I think there was a $2 million quarter-over-quarter decline in your non-ETF, that institutional passive category. I know there's a bunch of moving parts in there and some of that is kind of recorded on a lag. But can you speak to that sequential decline that we saw in the third quarter?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. I mean you're exactly right. There is some timing stuff going on. There's a one-quarter lag. If you look at run rate, year-over-year run rate is up 24%, lots of new licenses. It's part of the business that we feel really good about the trajectory and the continued growth here.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Andy Wiechmann for closing remarks.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Imani. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We really appreciate the continued support and belief in the MSCI story. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. And as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with any additional questions. Happy to be helpful wherever we can. Thank you, everyone, and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question and one follow-up. Further instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Andrew Wiechmann, Head of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Bridget. Good day and welcome to the MSCI second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter 2018. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we've prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You're cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures on pages 23 to 27 of the earnings presentation. We will also discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of acquisitions or divestitures. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Andy, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. The record second quarter sales and the exceptional financial results are as a direct result of our deliberate and targeted investment in core, strategic areas of our firm. This investment to accelerate growth and profitability are centered around three areas; delivering actionable solutions, creating differentiated content and flexible technology to develop that content and enable it for use of our clients. Let me elaborate in each one of these areas. First, actionable solutions refers to the usage of our products and services by our clients to achieve their specific investment objectives. Such usage may involve single or multiple MSCI product for services. The usage may also be supported by insight from our research team to help our clients understand how those tools can be utilized. We have been aggressively enhancing these actionable solutions by building out our client coverage our services, our research capabilities, and making investments in this content and this technology. As you know all too well, the investment industry is undergoing a massive transformation with participants trying to sharpen their business models, creating efficiencies and scale, and trying to understand the drivers of performance and risk in their portfolios. This transformation is creating a huge opportunity for MSCI, manifesting itself in the great success that we're having with our solutions selling which will Baer discuss in more detail later. Secondly, our relentless innovation in differentiated content is based on key bets. They are in equity content, such as are ESG Ratings, our enhanced Equity Factor Models, ESG and factor indices as well as our broader range of global custom and specialized indices. The key bets are also in fixed income and multi-asset class content, such as our new liquidity analytics, our enhanced library of cash flow models, our broader security coverage and our enhanced multi-asset class factor model; and also in private asset class content, such as our private equity and private real estate risk models, and our new global real estate information products. Thirdly, these bets in actionable solutions and in differentiated content will be enabled by our investments in state-of-the-art and flexible technology in everything we do, from accessing outside data, processing to create content for us and for our clients, and enabling the use of our content by our clients. In the last category, we are developing a truly unique client platform that will greatly enhance the value of our content as well as content from our clients and other third-parties. This client platform will provide functionality not currently available in the market and which will easily integrate within client workflows. In the realm of technology, we're also increasingly employing proprietary and third-party machine learning and AI techniques to scale up our ability to gather and analyze data, automate and enhance the efficiency of many of our data processors, as well as generate unique research insights for our models. In summary, clients are just beginning to embrace the full range of capabilities across MSCI and this is showing up in the increased sales and also record financial results of the company. Like Baer and our COO, Laurent Seyer, I've been spending half of my time on the road over the last year with C-level executives at many of the world's largest investment organizations. What I hear from many of them is that they want more engagement from MSCI to provide them with the products, the services, the research that they can use to help them solve their investment problems and capitalize on their business opportunities. Therefore, we're tremendously energized by the enormous opportunities ahead of this firm. We are further excited by our ability to attract very talented and experienced professionals. In the last few months, we have announced the addition of the following senior executives. Our new Chief Technology Officer and Head of Engineering, Jigar Thakkar, had an impressive track record at Microsoft in software engineering leadership positions. Our new Head of Client Solutions, Russell Read, over the last two decades served as the Chief Investment Officer of Alaska Permanent, Gulf Investment Corporation in Kuwait, and CalPERS in California. Our new Head of Asia-Pacific Coverage, Jack Lin, brings over 20 years of experience at Amundi, Pioneer, Janus, and Franklin Templeton. George Harrington, our new Global Head of Index, Futures and Options Licensing, brings over 20 years of experience in financial markets and global (9:03) changes at Bloomberg most recently. Stéphane Mattatia, our new Head of Index Products in Europe, brings over 15 years of experience in structured products at Société Générale. And lastly, and not least, our new Global Controller, Jen Mak, joins us from Honeywell where she was the Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. MSCI is becoming a magnet for extremely talented people with a mission to change the investment world. I am confident they will help the MSCI franchise to scale new heights. Lastly, we're obsessively focused on investing only in our most core and attractive growth areas. We are highly disciplined about divesting of our product lines that are not fully aligned with our strategy, particularly if we do so at attractive market valuations. We announced this week that we'll be divesting InvestorForce, reflecting our commitment to allocating capital to its most strategic and highest return possible. This very intense focus on strategic core areas, effective capital allocation and maximum operating efficiency has allowed us to generate double-digit organic subscription run rate growth in Q2, substantially higher than the growth levels just a few years ago. Given the enormous growth opportunities and our track record of execution, we are excited about our long-term outlook. Let me now turn the call over to Baer.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Henry. I'll start on slide 5 highlighting in more detail the manner in which we are serving clients in new and innovative ways. The versatility and utility of our content and applications allow us to package our offerings for a wide range of use cases and help clients adapt to the fast-changing investment industry. Driven by our keen focus on increasing market penetration, there has been growing momentum in many of our key client segments, such as asset owners, asset managers, wealth managers, and broker dealers. Each segment experienced double-digit year-over-year subscription run rate growth and they collectively comprise around 85% of our subscription run rate. Let me elaborate further in each of these categories, starting with asset owners. Asset owners are increasingly insourcing portions of their investment activities. Consequently, these clients are using our analytics, ES&G contacts and our indexes, including factor and ES&G indexes to assist them with understanding their portfolio risks, managing their exposures and achieving their overall investment objectives. Following a recent multi-product solution sale, a large U.S. pension fund, who already uses our market cap indexes as policy benchmarks, will begin to implement factor strategies across their plan. The pension fund chose to license our multi-asset class factor analytics platform to support them in portfolio construction and risk management. They also licensed our models to allow factor exposure reporting to their plan board and for evaluating the factor performance drivers of their active portfolio. Additionally, they made an allocation to track an MSCI Factor Index, leading to downstream revenue for us. Our client coverage and research teams with support from the executive team played a key role in helping the client understand how the range of our capabilities can be used together. These type of opportunities have driven year-over-year subscription run rate growth of 16% across the asset owner client segment. Turning to active asset managers, this segment is increasingly looking to differentiate themselves and explain how they create value. To enable this, active asset managers are turning to MSCI and leveraging our content like factor analytics to construct strategies that demonstrate differentiated alpha and manage factor bets. Increasing numbers of clients are licensing our ES&G ratings to highlight favorable ES&G practices. This is also our largest segment for multi-asset class risk and performance analytics. These opportunities drove year-over-year subscription run rate growth of 11% across this client segment. Within broker dealers, we're finding numerous new opportunities to help them better serve their retail and institutional clients with structured products, like index-linked notes or factor overlay instruments increasingly with ES&G tilts. Overall, year-on-year subscription run rate growth was 10% within this segment. This opportunity has been further enhanced by growing liquidity in the MSCI-based index and futures options markets. Q2 run rate in futures and options, based on our indexes, was up approximately 36% year-on-year. We're seeing similar One MSCI demand from wealth managers, whose need to build model portfolios based on our indexes is helping to fuel 10% plus growth rate within this client segment. We are better able to identify these type of opportunities through enhanced go-to-market strategies. In addition to our established client relationships at the user level, we are increasingly engaging the C-Suite at our clients and leveraging our research team to engage with investment professionals at our clients about how they can use our products and services to help them achieve better investment-related objectives. Now let's turn to slide 6. Slide 6 highlights some of the key statistics, which reflect the benefits of these opportunities. As you can see, more and more clients are using products from across all segments, and our largest clients are growing at a higher growth rate than the rest. We also see the benefits of these opportunities in our strategic account manager program. Our strategic clients comprise our largest clients, representing 41% of our total subscription run rate, and both key statistics such as 11% subscription run rate growth and 95.7% retention rate. We've had a strong pipeline of new product enhancements in the first half of the year, which will continue into the next two quarters. With that, I turn the call over to Kathleen.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll start on slide 7. Q2 was a great quarter. Our franchise is as strong as ever and we continue to execute at a high level as you can see by the exceptional revenue and EPS growth and strong cash flows. We are executing many organic growth opportunities and building on our track record of delivering robust returns. We remain very focused on driving a disciplined approach to our investments. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by recurring subscription revenue with continued strength in index and ESG, up 13% and 25% respectively. ABF revenue growth was fueled primarily by growth in AUM of equity ETF linked to our indexes, with average AUM in MSCI-linked equity ETF up 31% from the same period last year. This was largely driven by strong cash inflows over the last 12 months with MSCI-linked equity ETFs capturing 21% of total market share over that period as well as market appreciation year-over-year. On slide 8, you can see the drivers of adjusted EPS growth. Our strong execution in the quarter resulted in high-quality earnings growth, mainly driven by the operating momentum we continue to drive. The EPS benefit from higher revenue is primarily driven by the tailwinds provided by our investments over the years in areas like factors and ESG, and engagement with clients at the C-Suite level. We experienced a positive impact as a result of tax reform and increased interest income from cash investments, partially offset by incremental interest expense due to the new financing. Now, let's turn to our segment results on slide 10. Within the Index segment, we had strong subscription revenue growth driven by higher growth client segments, like wealth managers, broker dealers as well as asset managers, coupled with outsized growth in our newer modules. We continue to deliver new content. For example, we launched 125 new China A Indexes and expanded our ESG module history. Our focus on expanding use cases and gaining new clients helped drive growth of 7% in our Analytics segment, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the divestiture of our FEA business. Asset managers and asset owners were significant contributors with year-over-year run rate growth of 11% and 12%, respectively. We remain cautiously optimistic about the momentum we are seeing. Within Analytics, on July 30, we announced the planned divestiture of InvestorForce, which provides workflow services used by investment consultants to construct the performance reports for their clients. The sale is expected to close in late Q3 or early Q4. In our All Other segment, the growth was mainly driven by ESG, with strong growth in EMEA, which represents 41% of total ESG run rate; and strong growth in our ESG Ratings product as investors increasingly integrate ESG into their investment processes. Slide 11 provides a summary of our key operating metrics by segment. Organic subscription run rate growth further accelerated, up 10.2%, substantially higher than the 4% level just five years ago. Net new was up over 50% across all segments. In Index, we had strong growth in asset-based fee and subscription run rate, up 21% and 12%, respectively. We've had great momentum in asset-based fees, as we continue to drive asset owner mandates and licenses to our indexes for new equity ETFs and passive funds. Within the Index subscription run rate, we generated 14% growth in EMEA due to continued expansion of content and deeper client engagement. Asia also performed well, up 15%, driven by momentum in China and Japan. Our largest client segment, asset managers, grew 10% in subscription run rate as our innovation continues to enhance our content and services. We've also had great success with sales into segments like asset owners growing 23% and wealth managers growing 29%. We continue to gain traction in selling factor and ESG modules with subscription run rate up 42% and 43%, respectively. Custom and specialized modules have also performed very well, growing 22% and 20%, respectively. Index recorded its best recurring sales quarter ever and the Q2 Index retention rate remained very strong at 95.9%. Within Analytics, the run rate growth was driven by continued success within our multi-asset class analytics with run rate up 10% and within our equity analytics up 7%. The analytics retention rate was 92.1%. Cancels in Analytics were higher compared to prior year and were driven by broker dealer and hedge fund clients, where we saw client cost pressures with the closing of trading desks, hedge fund closures, and partial cancellations at clients looking to reduce costs. We're increasing our efforts around refining our go-to-market strategy and client service model to mitigate and offset cancel risks. The recurring net new growth for Analytics was up 55.5% versus the prior year with strength in sales of multi-asset class products to asset owners and asset managers. On a first half basis, net new was up 15%, excluding the impact of the FEA divestiture. Sales and cancel activity in this segment are lumpy due to the more sizable and complex deals in the pipeline. Given this lumpiness, we look at the longer-term run rate trend as we assess and evaluate the performance of the product segment. You can see by the momentum in our Analytics run rate that we continue to execute our roadmap to deliver improved growth. Slide 12 highlights the drivers of our asset-based fees in more detail. Equity ETFs linked to MSCI Indexes now totaled slightly over 1,000 ETFs and reflect one of the most globally diversified group of ETFs in the industry with about 20% exposure to the U.S. markets and the remainder spread across emerging markets and developed markets outside the U.S. Year-to-date, we've licensed our indexes to 59 new equity ETFs, 38 of which are based on our factor and ESG indexes. The total number of equity ETFs benchmarked to our factor and ESG indexes is 326, which represents 26% of all equity ETFs based on factor and ESG indexes, more than any other provider. Total AUM of these equity ETFs linked to our factor and ESG indexes have grown by 36% compared to last year, bringing the total to $97 billion as of June 30. Total AUM was down 2.6% from the end of Q1 and was primarily driven by a decline in market values and a modest cash outflow from the equity ETFs linked to our indexes. We saw cash flows predominantly moving into U.S. and global equity ETF, and out of emerging markets and developed markets outside the U.S. The market declines and flows out of EM and DM ex-U.S. also impacted the average basis points, given that these ETFs are typically relatively higher fee products. Looking at our mix, cash inflows went when primarily into products with lower total expense ratios, which tend to carry lower average basis point fees. We continue to expect lower fee products to capture a disproportionate share of new flows into equity ETF. And we expect a further decline in our average basis point fee levels as part of our efforts to achieve continued run rate growth. Our ETF partners are continually evaluating their market opportunities for existing and new products, as well as the optimal positioning and pricing of those products. And as such, we have discussions with all of our key partners about our fees and fee constructs on an ongoing basis. Now, let's turn to slide 13, where we provide some additional detail on the quarterly net cash flows of the equity ETFs linked to MCI indexes. Given the movement this quarter, we think it is important to provide some commentary around the Q2 flows and our longer-term view of the space. Let's start with what happened with global flows. As you know, there was an overall slowdown in global flows into equity ETFs during Q2. Specifically, there was $60 billion in net flows in Q2 into equity ETFs, which was only about half of the $120 billion average over the last five quarters. Furthermore, of that $60 billion, about 80% went into U.S. equity ETFs as investors are favoring U.S. exposure. There were several factors that drove the slowdown in geographic rotation. Investors have heightened uncertainty due to international trade tensions and geopolitical risks. These concerns, coupled with and related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and recent international market underperformance, drove investors out of emerging markets and developed markets ex-U.S. and into U.S. funds, including higher-quality fixed-income funds. Now, turning to MSCI-specific flows, these dynamics resulted in net outflows from equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes during the second quarter. On a first half basis, we had strong flows and market share gains. ETFs based on our indexes captured flows across all markets and into key growth areas such as factor and ESG indexes. In emerging markets, ETFs based on our indexes captured flows of about 36%, reflecting our strength outside the U.S. and significantly higher share of equity ETFs in these markets. ETFs based on our factor and ESG indexes on a combined basis captured 25% of flows, and U.S. equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes captured 14% of flows, markedly higher than the 10% we captured in all of 2017. We remain confident in the long-term secular trends in the ETF space and our strategy of structuring our licensing agreements with ETF providers to increase our market share through volume growth to drive long-term run rate growth. If there is ongoing market volatility, we believe we are well positioned to manage through periods of downturn given the strength of our subscription business and the readiness of our downturn playbook. If you look at the last 10 years through other market downturns, our index subscription run rates have continued to perform well, growing around 10% or higher each year. Turning to Analytics, slide 14 provides you with additional detail on the Analytics trajectory. Following investments in restructuring initiatives over the last several years, we've driven gradual improvement in both run rate growth and margin. We continued to enhance our offerings and go-to-market efforts and have seen accelerating growth in our focus areas of equity analytics and multi-asset class analytics. These two areas make up nearly 90% of the Analytics run rate. Additionally, equity analytics is a key component of and differentiator for our factor indexes, providing a key benefit to our high growth Factor Index franchise. Outside of these areas, we have a few smaller product offerings which have had lower or negative growth. For certain products, we're in the process of enhancing the capabilities and migrating functionalities to improve growth. For non-core products, we have divested these offerings with the divestiture of FEA in Q2 and the recently announced sale of Investor Force Holdings. Run rates for FEA and InvestorForce represented approximately $8 million and $17 million, respectively. And we do not expect a meaningful impact to the expense base as a result of the divestitures given our continued focus on investing in other areas to drive growth. On slide 15, we provide an update on two strategically key areas of integrated content innovation where our bets are clearly paying off. Our growth in factors continues to be driven by the growing interest in diversifying exposures and understanding and designing portfolios around factors as clients seek to provide differentiated investment products. Regarding ESG, new clients drove about 50% of recurring sales in the quarter. As ESG increasingly becomes an integral part of the investment process, we're focused on maintaining our position as a leader in the space. We continue to invest in our capabilities, broadening our ratings coverage, which currently stands at 13,000 issuers. We continue to scale up, supporting our global team of over 170 research analysts with increasing use of AI and machine learning technologies. As of June 30, there was nearly $11 billion of AUM in equity ETFs linked to our ESG index, which grew 74% year-over-year. Turning to the next section, we provide an update on our capital, liquidity and our 2018 guidance. On slide 17, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. With the completion of our $500 million notes offering in May, our leverage has increased slightly above the high end of our targeted leverage range. The proceeds from this financing, combined with the existing cash on our balance sheet, has resulted in a very strong cash position. Consistent with our past practices, we intend to remain disciplined around the use of that cash and deploy it opportunistically for repurchases during times of increased volatility and targeted bolt-on M&A. Additionally, our board of directors approved a 53% increase in our quarterly dividend on July 31. We're also increasing our dividend payout ratio target to a range of 40% to 50% of adjusted EPS from the previous range of 30% to 40%. This reflects the strength of our franchise and our confidence in our continued strong financial performance. Slide 18 highlights our strong track record of returning capital. Year-to-date, we've deployed $223 million to repurchase a total of 1.5 million shares of our stock. With the exception of the change to our dividend policy, our approach to capital allocation remains the same with no changes to our leverage target or our approach to repurchases. Lastly, as you see on slide 19, we have one update to our guidance. We expect interest expense of $133 million as a result of the May financing. Otherwise, our guidance and long-term targets remain the same. Also, I'd like to point out that while our adjusted EBITDA expense guidance range is consistent with our previous guidance, we currently expect to be at the higher end of our guidance range. In summary, we had a very strong first half of the year as the team continues to execute extremely well against our strategy. The investments in high ROI projects have been a major tailwind for us as our franchise continues to strengthen. Our growth opportunities continue to expand and we are focused on continuing to deliver strong top-line growth. We very much look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, we'll open the line to take your questions.
Operator: And as a reminder, we ask that you please only ask one question and one follow-up at this time. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Would love for you guys to comment a little bit about the – I don't know if it's the topic du jour, but the announcement from Fidelity yesterday to basically move to a zero management fee product. Now, I know it was index mutual funds. I don't think you have a lot of exposure in that area anyways. But just curious what do you think that signals, if it's a change from the trajectory that we've been on when it comes to fee erosion in general. And I guess maybe just related to that, I think you made a comment around you will always negotiate and have discussions with your customers. Just want to press if there was anything new in that or why you made that comment, Kathleen, I think it was you. So, any bigger picture comments would be helpful here as well.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: No. Thanks for that question, Alex. There is relatively no new information coming out of the announcement of Fidelity. Basically, it is part of a trajectory in this industry, like any other industry, that when you have attractive returns in certain parts of the world, capital flows to that, participants flows to that, and it puts pressure, obviously, on pricing. So, we expect that to continue, for sure. We also expect that to be a long-term trend with certain step functions along the way, but it's a long-term trend. And therefore, we are focused with ourselves, with also our partners in either mutual fund managers, or index fund managers, or ETF managers, to optimize our opportunity in the context of those trends and those competitive dynamics. And what that is, is focused on what we call run rate growth or revenue growth and optimizing the tradeoff between volume and pricing and positioning obviously of our offerings and, in their case, their offerings, their investment offerings to the client base. So, that's what we have been doing for a very long time. If you want to think about it, that's what we did back in 2012 in the context of a large client leaving us at the time, and we ended up with recovery and a great result after that. So, that's that. Now, with respect to the dialogue we have with all of our clients, including our largest clients is, obviously, we constantly have debate and discussions as to what is the right positioning strategy. They tell us what the view, their right position strategy for their investment products and how we fit into that as the supplier of the indices into those products, what is the appropriate distribution, to what type of client, what clients are more price sensitive, what client are less, what clients are focused more on liquidity of products versus long and hold, and therefore how do we optimize the volume price tradeoff in order to come out with a large amount of market share and a large amount of revenues. So, there's no difference what we've been doing in the past. My sense, Alex, is that those conversations will clearly continue at a fast pace and will intensify as the industry tries to find an equilibrium in all of this and tries to pick the winners and the losers in that equilibrium, and of course we want to be a large player among the winners.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you. And just shifting gears for a second, and I was very pleasantly surprised about the sales performance or net sales performance this quarter. Maybe if you can just flesh it out a little bit more. I think you've made comments or prepared us in the past that the second half of the year should be really where sales accelerate, given kind of like the changes you've made to the compensation structure. So, was there any pull forward, anything you would point out that maybe the second half may be on a different trajectory now or why was the second quarter just such a surprising stand-out, I guess?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Look, I think the second quarter, similarly to the fourth quarter of 2017, are just early indications of the capital allocation we're making in terms of – let me back up, the strategic focus that we're trying to put in the highest and more strategic growth areas of our company as opposed to the ones that are not. And the ones that are not, we either divest them completely or we harvest them. So, that's the strategic focus. The second part is the capital allocation we provide. We're putting a lot more capital on those strategic areas that are giving us high ROI opportunities, and medium or lower capitals to the ones that don't, but continue to be strategic. And obviously, in terms of profitability and, especially, funding of these investment initiatives, we are obsessively focused on continuously creating efficiencies in the company in order to free up money for profitability and free up money for investment. So, that's no different. So, what you see in the growth rate, for example, Alex, is that clearly, we're very focused on factors – factor investing and within the whole compendium from factor analytics to factor indexes, and the like. We're very focused on the ESG ecosystem from ESG Research and coverage of securities, to ESG Ratings to ESG Indexes, and all that. And that is, obviously, another growth drivers of this. Within Analytics, when you go to page 14 of the slide, we wanted to give you this slide so you can see that the area that we care the most about, which is multi-asset class analytics and equity analytics, are the areas that are growing the most, 10% in the last period here on multi-asset class and fixed income, and 7% on equity analytics. What the drive is, is this other area which has, this slide, $54 million of run rate and, by the way, this $54 million does include the $17 million run rate of InvestorForce that would obviously be out of that once we close that transaction. That is a little bit of a drag. And therefore, we're either divesting or improving or harvesting parts of that. So, what you see here is, in the growth of the revenue, it's obviously the investment that we're making, but also a little bit of a change of mix which is indexes is growing faster, ESG is growing faster, factor analytics are growing faster, and we're either divesting or depriving capital from those areas that are lower growth areas. And therefore, we will anticipate to see a continuation of this, but in a gradual process with some lumpiness quarter-by-quarter because of the Analytics segment.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. My first question was, I was hoping – Kathleen, you talked about your confidence in your recession playbook, and I was hoping you could just expand a little bit in terms of what some of those steps would be that you would take. Even now, it sounds like you're accelerating your index subscription growth, even though the backdrop is tough for the active managers. So, I was hoping for a few examples, anecdotes of what's in that playbook basically.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Sure. So, first, I'd say, when you think about our cost structure, it's important to kind of understand that we're largely a people business, right, so we're comprised of people. And so, one of the things that we're constantly looking at – and we very much have a mindset of continuous improvement. We're constantly looking at, are we doing everything as efficiently as possible. And so, we're always looking for opportunities to drive efficiencies and leveraging technology to efficiencies. So, that is something that we're continuing to use as a lever for improvement. In terms of should we go into a downturn environment, we look at our cost structure, and we say, okay, well, what are the components of our costs that are variable. And those are the types of things that we would lever up and down. For example, there are portions of compensation costs, obviously, that are variable costs. And so, those would be the levers that we would go to, and we would look at things that – first, we would look at things that would not impact our ability to invest and continue to drive top-line growth. So when we prepare that downturn playbook, it's very much prioritized in terms of kind of what are the Tier 1 things that don't impact our ability to grow. And then, we would have lower on that list other items.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just maybe just to round out the capital allocation comments you made. I guess you guys just sold InvestorForce. Is there an ongoing portfolio review of the company, did that just come up? Just some color on if there's anything in the back there.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, portfolio review is always an ongoing process. I mean, we're doing that all of the time to make sure that we've got the right assets with the right growth profile in our firm in the portfolio. So, we've looked at the areas that have been lower or negative growth and said, those are – we're going to address that, as Henry said, either by divestiture or by improving that growth rate – enhancing the product and improving that growth rate. So, we've done, as you've noted, the two small divestitures here in terms of FEA and the pending InvestorForce divestiture. We're going to continue to look at the portfolio, but there's nothing substantial right now.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Henry, you mentioned at the beginning of the call a number of new executive appointments, and there were quite a few there. So, I was wondering if you've had any, I guess, higher-than-unusual turnover or is it more related to expansion or a change of strategy? And could this result in a change in culture? And I'm not trying to imply that this would necessarily be negative, but just wanted to hear your thoughts on that. Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, we've always been, Toni, a company that does both. We promote from within and bring talent laterally at all levels of the company. We try not to be either or, because there is always a great opportunity to bring new fresh, new blood – new fresher blood into the company and, obviously, reward the talents of the people that are in the company. So, there's no change in that here. Secondly, all these hires are part of the investment plan that we have in key strategic areas. We've mentioned C-level selling with our clients and solutions selling. So, Russell Read will play a large role in there. We talked about the technological transformation of the company. So, we have a saying inside MSCI that we need to become a Silicon Valley high-tech company. Whether we're there or we have a long way to go, I don't know. But we, for sure, will do that very hard, and Jigar comes to help us achieve that. We talked about the – clearly, Asia is a big region that we want to focus on. We've had a vacancy there for about a year and a half in the head of that region. Laurent has been managing it day-to-day from London. So, that's a backfill there. Another example is, obviously, you heard us talk about the opportunity – the large opportunity we have in building index futures and options linked to MSCI indices, already helping exchanges do that around the world. So, we've beefed up that area with George Harrington coming to – so that we can put a lot more emphasis and grow that category, and so on and so forth. So, I don't think this is a change of policy at all. I don't think this an outside investment. It's all embedded in the total run rate of EBITDA and EBITDA expenses and all of that. And there's no change in policy and there's no change in the culture, because we've always done it this way.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then while the retention is still exceptionally strong for each of the segments, the Index retention rate was down about 110 bps year-over-year and Analytics down by about 180 bps. Is there any one time items in either of those segments, just to help understand why the rates did drop even though they're still in the 90s? Thanks.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Toni. No, there's no particular one-time item there. Look, the retention rates, they kind of move up and down a little bit within a particular range. But 95.9% for Index and 92% for Analytics is very much within the kind of normal range of what we would expect.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. I don't know if you already covered this or not, but I was hoping to get a little more color on the sales activity in the Index and Analytics and where there are lumpy items in the quarter and just how we should look at the sales on a go-forward basis.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think the biggest thing here is we've been very consistent in our objective to show steady improvement in Analytics growth. And it's precisely the point that I was trying to make on slide 5 about the ecosystem that as our capabilities improve and as our clients see us execute effectively, it's become something of a virtuous circle. So, I think that we've been consistent in that story about Analytics. I think, there's nothing extraordinary in the Index numbers, per se. So look, we've said this before and it will continue to be the case that we cannot manage every – particularly, certain large sales may come a little – just after the quarter end or just before. But my headline here is, I wouldn't read too much into it. I think it's a consistent performance. I don't think it's an unusual performance. And we wouldn't view this as being an outlier in any way, and it's part of a steady trend.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So particularly in Analytics, where sometimes you can have larger deals that can kind of skew a quarter, in this instance, that's not the case. It was really – the strong sales are really comprised of many kind of normal sized deals, I would call them.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on the Index, were there, I guess – it sounds like there weren't any extraordinary size deals or...
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: No.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: No.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: A little confused there.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: No. Not at all. Just I would call it was a normal – normally successful quarter. Nothing unusual, no particularly outlier deals or anything that's worthy of comment.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it was pretty much broad, strong performance across the board within – if you look at index subscription, whether you look at it by content area, if you will, factors and ESG driving strong performance, each of the client segments doing really well and each of the regions showing strong performance as well.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Henry, on the whole Fidelity thing and, I think, JPMorgan a couple of months ago, do you think that we're going to see more and more of the index funds and ETFs using ETF providers as calculation agents, at least in the retail space? And can you give us – I know it's probably tough to answer, but at least a sense of magnitude of how the fees might differ if you're a calculation agent versus providing the index itself? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So I think, Chris, there is no question that this category will continue to grow and that is the focus that we have at MSCI, how do we capture the significant amount of this growth in all this ETF and index funds and passive categories with our indices, how do we position them and all of that. And as part of that, we use tools such as pricing in order to capture volume and market share. We believe that in a growth trajectory of any product or any industry, the name of the game is to capture a lot of market share, because when it becomes fixed, it's a lot harder to do that, and then it's just a price game, right? So we do that. Now, our indices are obviously invested by us and calculated by us. Other entities provide calculation services to clients that are sort of white labeling or vanilla calculation services. We tend not to do that. We only do that when either us or the client makes the content, so to speak, the index strategy together with a client, and then we serve as calculation of that using our universal securities, our infrastructure and the like. So, we're doing this with a few of the ETF managers that have been launching products recently and we get paid basis points on the basis of that. But we believe that we're adding value in terms of the creation of the content, not just being a calculator that can easily be replaced by somebody else in the future.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. You had an uptick in – and I know you talked about this a little bit earlier, but you had an uptick in the subscription portion of the growth rate. I wonder if you could provide a little bit more color on how you think about that, both short term and long term, and how sustainable that is.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, there are two things that are – there are three things. One is, we clearly are trying really hard to consistently grow our subscription run rate in the low-teens, right, in the 10% to 11%, 10% to 12% kind of area. Given the recent past, say, the last five, seven years, it has not been growing in that area. The subscription run rate grew in the kind of 10% area in the five years leading up to 2017, or five years leading up to that. And then we're now trying to migrate to like 11%, 12% type of area. But we don't know, obviously, how successful we can be. We're doing that by kind of three areas. The easiest area is divesting the things that have low growth or negative growth, and that's the categories in Analytics that we were talking about before. The second area is be an innovation machine so that you're adding content to that subscription that is growing at a much faster pace. ESG and factors will be in that category. And then thirdly, then making sure that the big ship (56:22), which is the big ship (56:23) of indices in the subscription who are multi-asset class risk and fixed income, for example, are not being dilutive to growth, but are actually being accretive to growth. So those are the three categories. So you will, hopefully, see a continuation of this. If we continue to be effective at innovating and creating new content that, therefore, may start small, but over time becomes bigger and are higher growth rates, such as the factor space and the ESG space, and continuing to make constant improvement in growing the bigger run rate and then harvesting or getting rid of the things that are dilutive to that.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, Joe, just to point you to the data, you probably know that it's there, but in the appendix you can see total company and by segment subscription run rate growth over the last five years. So, you can see all of that information there. And you can see from that that our obsession and focus on driving that improved run rate growth is yielding itself in the numbers and the performance, and we're continuing to focus on that.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. And just as a follow-up, I know you talked a little bit about pricing also in the opening remarks. How do you see pricing trending? And is that a tool for you to take market share or penetrate new markets? And how do you see the balance there with the margin profile? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So remember, pricing – we are a multi-product company. We're not a multi-business company, we're a multi-product, one business company. So, therefore, pricing varies by product line. We do price increases in our index subscription, we do price increases in a lot of our analytics. We're beginning to do price increases in our real estate product lines and the like. So then, we clearly have been doing price increases on our particular ESG and factor indices or what we call institutional passive type of products. The category that pricing is either static or declining is the ETF category, sort of as an example. So, we continue to see that happening as scale builds up and efficiency builds up in the industry and as people are trying to capture the market share in the industry. And we are a provider of the index into those managers. And therefore, we want to align our strategy in terms of content, in terms of pricing and in terms of volume, our market share to the strategy of those ETF managers. So, that will definitely continue. What we want to focus on is the growth of the run rate, which is made up of volume or market share, and pricing. In the past, there has been an enormous (59:36) amount of focus on only the pricing part, not the volume part, but the pricing is a tool that is being used to drive and market share in order to create higher revenue. And we'll continue to see that in the industry and we'll continue to do that ourselves.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good afternoon. Thank you. Was hoping you could sort of make any comments on self-indexing, I know you've spoken to your customer base. Any updated views on that or what you're hearing that may be different and sort of your viewpoint there.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, so we believe that will continue in the marketplace, and let me tell you why. Look, in the distant past, indices were used only as references to build portfolios. It was more of a guide to build a portfolio. What is happening now is that indices – the building of indices and the creation of indices, they are becoming the portfolio itself. The index is the underlying basis of the portfolio itself. So therefore, it will be – it is ingenious to think that the entire investment industry is just going to rely on third-party indices to beat the underlying basis for their actual portfolios. And therefore, you will see clients create portfolios all the time, all the time, right. That's what their job is, creating portfolios. Some of those portfolios will be created by clients and be – have that referenced against an index. Some of those portfolios will be created by client with an underlying third-party index, like ours. And some of those portfolios will – the clients will say, look, I created a portfolio, I want to turn it into a formulaic approach to the portfolio and, therefore, I'll call it self-indexing. So, I don't see why that will not continue or even accelerate, because it's part of the portfolio creation, portfolio management process in the world. So, I see that happening, and that doesn't mean that is a threat to us. If anything, we will help clients create self-indexes in order to – because that's the job. We help clients achieve their goals. So part of their goals may be creating self-indexes, and in those self-indexes, for example, we may be the underlying securities, because we have that. We may be the underlying calculation of it and so on and so forth. So, we see that evolving in the industry.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And just a follow-up, you had mentioned factor and ESG indices are, I think, 23% market share, which is pretty large. Maybe if you could frame for us how that compares to your overall market share and how you think about that market share and runway going forward on the factor and ESG. And then just curious how that compares to how you judge your overall market share? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: We will get back to you on the exact numbers to make sure that we have the same information. We don't want to take a little time on the call, but we'll get back to you. And if anybody has that question, we can do that as well. What we can tell you is that we are the largest provider of factor indices in the world and we're the largest provider of ESG indices in the world probably by a wide margin – by relatively wide margin. So, we are the leader in the space, in number of indices, in number of ETFs underlying this indices, passive – other institutional passive funds underlying this indices and all of that, and we intend to remain doing that. And therefore, we have a meaningful amount of market share here that we want to continue and increase. And we can give you the exact dollar amounts in terms of market shares, and the exact amounts of the assets benchmarked to this passive or active and all of that.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Sure. We will connect offline. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Question on your ESG business. How much of your growth there would you say is from market share gains and how much is really just kind of going after a whitespace opportunity?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Whitespace opportunity, there is no such thing as displacing anybody in this space at this point.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then, for my follow-up, as we look at your asset-based revenues, can you maybe give a little bit more color – I know you spoke about it briefly earlier, but a little bit more color on the really impressive growth you've seen in your non-ETF revenues?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: On the passive side, so that – on the ABF, the asset-based fee category is made up of three components, right. The largest component is, obviously, ETF fees. The second largest is other forms of passive fees that are not ETF, that could be institutional passive, as we call it, and the like. And the third category is the futures and options on our indices, which is obviously growing pretty large. So on your question, which is the second category, the reason it's growing a lot is for two reasons. One is that, obviously, the category of institutional passive is growing just like the same way you see ETF, which are basically mostly passive, growing. The over-the-counter, so to speak, as opposed to exchange-traded category, is also growing, either institutional passive or mutual fund passive, and that is obviously providing that growth. The second growth is on the pricing. The part of the category that is market cap indices has had relatively low pricing for a long time, particularly the institutional part of that. But the ESG and factor part of that we're pricing at a much higher level, sometimes multiples of the level that we're pricing the market cap part of that category. And that is creating significant benefit. So, specifically, when a pension fund decides to invest passively, but not in ETF – I'm saying passively on ESG mandate or a factor mandate, or better yet the combination of factors and ESG, the index fee associated with that, either passively managed or actively managed, in this case, obviously, we're talking about passively managed, is higher than the market cap – the traditional market cap category.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Henry Chien with BMO. Your line is open.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just had a question on some of the changes or the additions to your management team. And I was just curious on the sales side, I mean it seems like you're targeting a number of new areas in the industry, whether it's wealth management and broker dealers. And just curious how you're thinking about the sales strategy there and are you sort of accelerating your sales push to sort of take advantage of that demand for these new products?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yes, for sure. Absolutely. So, I think those are both categories where we have clearly seen attractive growth over the last number of years and we felt that the business was both at an inflection point in terms of its scale and its growth potential that additional senior leadership could really make the most of that. So, I think it's really a sign, if you like, from a – not from a product point of view, but from a client point of view of – partly product in the futures and options area and partly client type, of the continued diversification of our portfolio. And the point that I was making on slide 5 of how our ecosystem becomes a virtuous circle. So, we're very pleased that we feel we can make these sort of investments, because that's what they are. They're investments in our colleagues, in humans, and we really feel confident that they will pay off in the next year and the years ahead.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. And just then my follow-up, in terms of the investment cycle, is the priority still ESG and factors, or – any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about product investment? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: I'm sorry. Repeat that question again. We...
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. So, I was just curious on your, I guess, investment plans for products. Is it still kind of staying the course and continuing to invest in the ESG and factors, or if just any updated thoughts on whether you're kind of exploring new areas as well?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. We clearly have a full hand here with the current content and also the technology to enable that content, both to produce that content, but also to distribute that content to our clients. So, that's already a fairly full deck of things. But we are gradually investing in other areas. Private asset classes is one example there. Clearly, we have been investing in the real estate – in the private real estate area that we don't talk about much on these calls, we should in the future. We are putting sort of seed investments in infrastructure, for example. Obviously, we have made investments in – that's on the performance side. On the risk side, we made investment on the private equity risk models and the private real estate risk models and the likes. So, that's one area that we are focused on, on the product side. And as you mentioned, on the client side, we have big opportunities on wealth, on exchanges, be it with futures and options. At some point, we will want to expand our coverage of life insurance companies, for example, and the like. So, we're only scratching the surface in many of these newer client segments.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. That's super helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question is from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Your line is open.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi. Just one from me. I just wanted to dig a bit further into the dialog you're having with ETF issuers. So, are clients negotiating price reductions around all of the MSCI-linked ETFs they have or around a specific ETF? So, whether it's like the old suite versus the new. I guess, you probably have more pricing power on the larger more liquid established products. And just to tack on to that, are they using this threat of self-indexing as a potential bargaining chip?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: No, most, if not all, of our clients are not. They want to do business with us and we have great relationships with them. So, it's not a question of threats or else I'll go anywhere. I mean, we believe that we add enormous amount of value to our clients, particularly our ETF manager clients, especially by the large following exemplified in the $14 trillion of assets that are following MSCI indices. So, to some extent, when a client launches a new ETF, it's a little bit of a call option in converting a bit of that amount of money into their products or attracting it into their products. So now, we don't comment on specific negotiations at all, whatsoever. But for sure, we always talk about everything. We talk about the new product lines. We talk about existing product lines. We talk about new geographies, because we look at the ETF market as if it were a one giant market and all homogeneous, it's very, very different. You have segments – you have geographies. The competitive dynamics in Europe are very different than the competitive dynamics in the U.S. and completely different than the competitive dynamics in Asia. Within those markets, the competitive dynamics on low cost retail products is very different than the competitive dynamics on institutional ETF or ETF that are highly used by institutions. The value proposition is very different. Institutions are looking to move large amounts of money with high liquidity and very tight bid/ask spreads. A lot of the retail marketplace is a buy and hold kind of investors and so on and so forth. So, we're looking to segment all of that market and have ongoing conversations with our clients about all of the components of that to maximize the fabric of or the tapestry of revenue in the context of volume and price and differentiation and value added in each one of the categories, whether it's a market category, or segment, or a geography, or a product segment.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Thanks.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew Wiechmann for closing remarks.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you so much, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We really appreciate the continued interest in the MSCI story. We look forward to keeping you guys posted on our progress. And as always, please feel free to reach out to me with any additional questions. Hope, you all have a great day. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question and a follow-up. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Wiechmann, Head of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Good day and welcome to the MSCI first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we've prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You're cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find a reconciliation of the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures on pages 23 to 27 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Good day to everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you can see by the first quarter highlights shown on slide 4 of the presentation we posted this morning, we delivered exceptional financial results during the quarter on the back of the significant momentum that we have been building. We delivered double-digit revenue and run rate growth, a 24% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a record 49% growth in adjusted EPS. I am thrilled to see the significant acceleration in our growth over the last several years with subscription run rate growth, excluding foreign exchange, improving from about 4% in Q1 2013, five years ago, to 9% this quarter. This acceleration has been driven through our continued focus on enhancing, expanding and, very importantly, integrating our core One MSCI franchise. Over that five-year period, we have added over 40,000 new indices to help our clients more effectively invest in a specific market, in the specific strategies and themes. We expanded and deepened our ESG coverage to include several thousand additional issuers, and incorporated a broader and richer set of ESG insights for our clients. We enhanced our global multi-asset class factor models, our suite of factor indices, and, most recently, we released our factor classification standard and Factor Box that have been fairly well-embraced. We work with our exchange partners and the trading community around the world to develop a dramatically deepened liquidity pool, a multi-country, multi-currency index futures and options. As a result, we have seen the quarterly volumes in futures and options based on our indices more than triple. This is an area of continued focus for us and significant upside potential. In addition to the strong financial result delivered during the quarter, we had several key accomplishments and notable milestones over the last few months that we believe add to our momentum and track record of enhancing and expanding our One MSCI franchise. We partnered more closely with clients like Jackson National Life Insurance Company who replaced our competitor's U.S. equity indices with MSCI indices for its external managers in their variable annuity business. Our excitement grows as clients choose to work more closely with MSCI because of our quality, reliability and cohesive investment framework. Over the quarter, we also launched a broad range of new China indices to allow investors to more effectively invest in the market in advance of the China A-share inclusion in our global indices later this month. Our focus on China is another area of continued investment because we believe with the opening of the country, both inflows and outflows of capital, it presents a significant opportunity for MSCI over the years. We worked with Thomson Reuters to integrate our multi-asset class risk analytics within Eikon, their flagship technology platform, to allow investors to understand areas of potential risks and undertake risk management of their portfolios within the Eikon platform. We established partnerships with Citigroup, Donnelley, Confluence and others to help mutual funds streamline new SEC reporting obligations to calculate and disclose certain risk and liquidity measures in their portfolios. Lastly, we remain extremely focused and committed to a very disciplined and consistent approach to capital optimization in terms of our capital base and our capital mix. In the recent soft and volatile market environment, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for a total value of about $210 million at an average price of about $145 since the beginning of the year. I will now turn the call over to Baer to provide additional color on our focused strategy and also, very importantly, to do an overview of a case study of a key investment area for us that illustrates well our ability to sustain growth by innovation and focus on continued investment across the investment process.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Henry. In my 18 years at MSCI, I've been proud to participate in the ongoing transformation of the company. As highlighted on slide 5, we believe we have the right strategy, focused on empowering our clients to make better investment decisions through differentiated content, flexible technology and applications, and actionable services and solutions. We continue to see many new potential areas of attractive growth aligned with this strategy within our core markets. And we are increasingly confident that we have the right systems, processes and talent to identify, evaluate and execute on these opportunities. On slide 6, we want to showcase in-depth one high return investment area that highlights how we can fuel a long trajectory of growth through product expansion and evolution and continued industry adoption, not too dissimilar from what we have done with our index franchise. Through our interactions with clients and as a result of grown societal and investor demands, we identified ESG as an important investment consideration and an attractive long-term growth opportunity well over a decade ago. Consequently, we embarked on a path of developing our leading ESG franchise through a combination of organic and inorganic investment. Over the years, we have greatly expanded our ESG offering and help drive change within the industry, transforming our offering from a screening tool for investors to identify and exclude companies with certain exposures into a suite of offerings to help investors achieve their ESG objectives. By broadening and deepening our research coverage and by creating a consistent and systematic ratings methodology, we have developed a framework that can be used by clients to construct portfolios to achieve certain ESG objectives, identify ESG risk exposures, and increasingly generate alpha. Today, we have ESG ratings coverage of 13,000 issuers, including equities, fixed income, and government-related entities, plus selected ESG information on a much broader set of companies. Similarly, this systematic approach provides a natural foundation for ESG indexes, which are increasingly being used for index product creation in equity ETFs and institutional passive allocations, as well as for benchmarking purposes, as asset owners are increasingly giving active mandates with ESG objectives. As of March 31, there were over $10 billion of AUM in equity ETFs linked to our ESG indexes, which represents about 57% of the total market for ESG equity ETFs and is up 99% from a year ago. Additionally, we have been gaining traction in discussing ESG with fixed income investors and we are seeing increased adoption of ESG ratings among them as well as increased use of our fixed income indexes, which we provide in partnership with Bloomberg. Most recently, we have seen opportunities for factor investing to be integrated with ESG ratings, which is further enabled by our Factor ESG Target Indexes. This allows clients to create highly targeted portfolios. We continue to see many other attractive opportunities to apply our ESG content to new use cases within a broader range of client segments. The continued investment and expansion of our offering in ESG has been further enabled by the adoption of new technologies. This is a product area that utilizes a significant amount of unstructured non-standardized data. In order to drive productivity and improved operating leverage, we have begun to incorporate natural language processing and artificial intelligence capabilities to automate the extraction of data points and to leverage this technology in our production environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kathleen to discuss the financial results, segment results, capital activity and guidance for the year ahead in more detail. Kathleen?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Baer, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll start on slide 7 and take you through our financial performance. Following on the momentum of last year, we delivered very strong financial results for Q1, driven by both strong ABF and strong subscription revenues. We delivered double-digit recurring subscription revenue growth, driven by continued strength in index and ESG and a slight acceleration in the analytics growth rate. Average AUM in equity ETFs linked to our indexes was $780 billion for the quarter which was up 9% from Q4 2017 and 49% from Q1 2017, driven by strong market appreciation and nearly 30% market share capture. We continue to be focused on driving efficiencies and maintaining ongoing positive operating leverage, while at the same time making investments to build out our capabilities. We see many attractive organic growth opportunities and are sharply focused on driving productivity to fund these investments. The diluted and adjusted EPS growth of 55% and 49% respectively represented the highest quarterly year-over-year organic EPS growth ever achieved by MSCI. The 139% growth in cash flow from operations and over 200% growth in free cash flow benefited from the increase in operating profits and very strong cash collections. On slide 8, you can see the drivers of adjusted EPS growth. We executed well during the quarter with a strong operating growth complemented by tax favorability. Of the $0.16 improvement from tax, about half was attributable to tax reform and half attributable to higher stock-based compensation windfall benefits and improvements to our international tax rate. Additionally, we experienced a slightly higher FX headwind. In Q1, the net EBITDA impact of the depreciating U.S. dollar was unfavorable by $3.5 million, driven mainly by appreciation of the euro, the Hungarian forint, and the pound. Now let's turn to our segment results on slide 10. Overall Index revenue growth was driven by further acceleration in the growth of equity ETF-related revenue, non-ETF passive revenue, and exchange-traded futures and options products. Index recurring subscription revenue growth was also very strong with growth in new modules and strong traction in client segments like wealth management and banks and broker dealers. In the Analytics segment, we're seeing the benefit of the strong sales we booked last year, which are now converting into revenue growth. Within Analytics, we successfully executed the divestiture on April 9 of FEA, which was a non-core product that served energy and commodity companies. FEA was a lower growth product for us and represented approximately $8 million of run rate. We do not expect a meaningful impact to the Analytics expense base as a result of the divestiture given our continued focus on investing in our core areas to drive growth. Finally, the strong growth in our All Other segment was mainly driven by ESG where growth continues to accelerate, as Baer highlighted earlier. Slide 11 provides a summary of our key operating metrics by segment. Our run rate growth of 16% continues to benefit from our sales momentum and the AUM growth experienced over the last year. Index operating performance was largely driven by strong growth in asset-based fee run rate, which was up 38% in Q1 versus prior year. We continue to gain traction in selling factor, ESG, custom and specialized modules, and we've had success with sales into segments like wealth management, hedge funds, and banks and broker dealers with year-over-year run rate growth of 24%, 16% and 13%, respectively. Index cancels were up modestly off a low Q1 2017 level and impacted recurring net new growth. Cancels were primarily driven by client events such as reductions in office locations and continued consolidation. The Q1 index retention rate remained very strong at 96.4%. Within Analytics, the run rate growth was driven by continued success with our factors analytics offering, up 9% year-over-year, as there is growing focus on factor investing. We also saw strength across multiple client segments, most notably in asset management up 13%; asset owners up 11%; and banks and broker dealers up 9%. Despite this momentum, overall Analytics net new was down during the quarter due to the timing of sales and cancels and elevated cancels in some of our smaller product areas. As a reminder, in Q4, we had very high sales coinciding with very low cancels. Following that very strong net new performance I mentioned on the prior earnings call, net sales and canceled activity in this segment is typically lumpy. This is becoming increasingly so as we're seeing more sizable deals and more complex deals in the pipeline, and this is what we saw in Q1. Our pipeline, however, remains solid and retention remains strong at 93%. We continue to be confident about executing our roadmap to deliver improved growth across this product segment. We see significant opportunities to continue to partner with our clients and help them more efficiently and effectively achieve their investment objectives. We're well-positioned to meet their demands and continue to evolve to meet their growing needs. Our run rate growth for the All Other segment was largely driven by ESG. As Baer highlighted earlier, ESG growth continues to accelerate and Q1 sales were up 54% versus prior year, its highest on record. Slides 12 and 13 provide some additional detail on the Index segment. On slide 12, we demonstrate how we continue to grow our Index subscription franchise. Institutional asset owners and asset managers continue to grow at a healthy rate despite continued headwinds on active management. The continued momentum in these established client segments is fueled by upsells of newer modules such as our factor, ESG, custom and specialized modules. Additionally, there is an accelerating focus on and adoption of Index products within client segments such as banks and broker dealers, wealth management and hedge funds as these clients are increasingly using our index content and services as a more efficient way to achieve their investment objective. We've been dedicating coverage resources to cover these segments and we're increasingly investing time to help these clients understand how our indexes can help them achieve their objectives. As passive and index-based investing represents an increasingly large part of global markets, it creates further demand from these client types as they develop index-based strategies in trade-in or create index-based products. We continue to be excited by the ongoing prospects of our index subscription revenue business. Turning to slide 13, we show additional details on our asset-based fees. The upper-left chart highlights the exceptional growth we're seeing across all components of asset-based fee revenue and across all index-linked investment products. During the first quarter, we licensed our indexes to 35 new equity ETFs, 28 of which were based on factor and ESG indexes, bringing the total number of equity ETFs benchmarked to MSCI indexes to 1,033, which represents 22% of all equity ETFs, more than any other provider. There were net inflows across ETFs based on most of our index families, with particularly strong flows into developed markets outside the U.S. and emerging markets, and into ETFs linked to both our flagship and new index categories, as highlighted in the Appendix on page 20. As index providers seek to capture additional inflows and AUM with lower fee products, we continue to execute our strategy of structuring our licensing agreements with providers with the intent to increase our market share and drive long-term run rate growth in our equity ETF asset-based fees. We expect lower fee products to capture a disproportionate share of new flows and, as a result, we expect a continued decline in our average basis point fee level. Exchange traded futures and options, based on our indexes, continued their exceptional growth and benefited from higher trading volume due to the market volatility during the quarter. As we expand the number of index futures and options products based on our indexes, engage with exchanges and educate the trading community on our indexes, we expect the global liquidity for our trading community for our index futures and options to grow. During the quarter, we saw 25 million futures and options contracts traded globally based on MSCI indexes, up 37% versus the prior year. The MSCI Emerging Market Index Future traded on ICE U.S. was the fourth largest index future globally based on open interest. Turning to Analytics, slide 14 provides you with an update on the run rate and the margin trajectory over the last several years. Over the last few quarters, we've seen gradual improvement in the run rate growth to the current level of 8%. We're beginning to see revenue growth improve on the back of strong sales throughout 2017. We continue to see strength in our core focus areas of equity analytics and multi-asset class analytics, particularly with factor analytics and within asset owners and asset managers as clients increasingly want these offerings to help them understand the drivers of performance and risk and to help them more effectively and efficiently achieve their objectives. We're focused on executing our strategy and achieving the acceleration in revenue growth that will drive further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion into our long-term targeted range of 30% to 35% over time. Turning to the next section, slide 16, 17, and 18 provide an update on our capital, liquidity and our 2018 guidance. On slide 16, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. Our gross leverage is at 3 times at the low end of our stated range of 3.0 to 3.5 times. The leverage target range is a long-term target. And at times, our leverage may drop below the range depending on our near-term cash needs and market conditions. And, similarly, our leverage may increase above the range at times after we execute a financing. The board of directors has authorized the company to opportunistically explore financing options, although any potential financing is subject to market and other conditions and there can be no assurance as to the timing or certainty of a transaction. We'll continue to monitor our excess cash position and the market for potential financing windows. Now, let's turn to slide 17. As we said in the past, we're constantly striving for the most efficient capital structure to maximize returns for our shareholders. Our strategy is consistent. We continue to view repurchases as a central part of our return of capital strategy, and we'll continue to repurchase shares opportunistically. We'll repurchase more shares when there is volatility and softness in the markets and when we have excess cash and fewer shares when volatility is low and we have lower excess cash balances. Year-to-date, through May 2, we deployed $210 million to repurchase a total of 1.4 million shares of our stock. We've already deployed more cash for repurchases than in all of 2017, demonstrating our commitment to this strategy. Lastly, our weighted average diluted share count increased slightly during the quarter, up from 92.5 million as of Q4 2017 to 92.6 million this past quarter as a result of additional dilution from employee stock unit awards that are tied to total shareholder return. Lastly, as you see on slide 18, we're maintaining our guidance for 2018 in all areas, including interest expense at $116 million which assumes no additional financing. In summary, in Q1, we continued to execute against our strategy and exercise disciplined financial management on all fronts with a very solid start to the year. We remain excited about our growth opportunities for the balance of 2018 and beyond, and we very much look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, we'll open the lines to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon. My first question was in the ESG case study that you guys showcased is there a way to break that out geographically? Just trying to get a flavor of whether the trend there is becoming more prevalent in the U.S. as opposed to what, I guess, we've historically viewed as more Europe-centric?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So this product line merely started to a large extent and was more prevalent in Europe, particularly the Nordic countries in Europe. But it has now significantly expanded in the U.S. market with the U.S. asset managers because, obviously, they need to compete for mandates among those European asset owners and some of the Canadian asset owners and some of the more advanced American asset owners that are focused on this area. So, that has, therefore, been a very sweet spot for us because we have excellent senior relationship with a lot of these big asset managers in the U.S., and, therefore, have been educating them and helping them think through how they integrate ESG ratings into their investment processes. So, therefore, there has been a very meaningful growth for us in the U.S. with the asset managers. We also are spending a great deal of time educating the asset owners, mostly the pension funds, in the U.S. who are lagging the Canadians and the Nordics and many of the other Europeans. So, that's another leg of benefit. And then, lastly, in this particular quarter, we had outside sales coming out of Asia from a small base but that also points us to a lot of optimism that the trend of ESG integration into the investment process is beginning to catch on in Asia. But, for now, the predominance of our revenues are coming from the U.S., which is the larger part, Europe second, and then a small revenue base from Asia but with a lot of optimism that that will increase significantly over time.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And I guess a similar question as my follow-up is more on the analytics side of the equation. Like are there faster-growing areas? Are there slower-growing areas? Is there any way to characterize the different pieces of that puzzle there?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Sure.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Go ahead, Baer. You can go ahead and I'll...
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. I'll make some broad observation and then turn it over to Kathleen. So, clearly, we distinguish between three buckets, maybe the simplest way to look at it: our core risk analytics, our equity-related factor business and some of the less core areas. So, we've clearly had slower growth in some of the less core areas and that has prompted us to take the action, for example, with FEA this quarter which we've posted. The equity analytics area is generally growing at the rate that Kathleen had mentioned, so call it high-single-digits or low-teens, depending on the particular area that you're looking at. And our core risk with core clients in analytics, we've had low-teens numbers in the last quarters. So, our view is that we have a strengthening story with equity factors broadly in the market and we just have a continual, steady improvement in our core risk analytics with core clients. And we will continue to focus on trying to solve the small product issues. So, that's how I'd broadly characterize it.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, let me just add a little bit of the numbers, Manav, just to give you some more color, and I'll talk about it both in terms of client segments and then content, if you will. But in terms of where we're seeing the stronger growth, well, first of all, let's step back. You're seeing the increasing trajectory, right, with run rate growth up to 8% this quarter. That's 6% FX. But in terms of where that is being driven, in particular, client segments or asset manager segment, as I mentioned, up 13%; our bank segment up 9%; and then as we've talked about, factor analytics run rate up 9% year-over-year. So, that's where we're seeing the positive strength.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Can you talk about the rationale for considering the increase in the debt to EBITDA to be on (32:08) 3.5 times? What do you think is a more reasonable level of debt at this point and is the likely usage just share repurchase and dividends or is there a potential for – or increasing potential for M&A?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, as Kathleen indicated and I mentioned it in my remarks, we are obsessively focused on what is the more slimmed down capital base that we can achieve, what is the best balance between equity and debt and in our investment plans organically internally, what are the highest return investments that we can make. So, very simply, how do we tighten up as much as possible the denominator and the mix of the denominator, and how do we increase to the maximum of our abilities the numerator to get the highest return possible on our capital? So, in the context of that, MSCI is a very large capital generator. Every single quarter, every single year, we generate capital, and, therefore, we are increasingly looking at ways to return that capital, taking advantage of volatility and softness and all of that. And as we are deleveraging, by the end of the year, we'll be in the high 2s in terms of gross leverage, and as we expect interest rates to increase, we are beginning to look at whether this is an opportune time to take advantage of the demand that exists in yield and particularly the demand that has existed in our bonds that are trading. And then in terms of the use of proceeds of something like this, it is definitely in terms of slimming down our capital. We always look at everything in terms of the M&A market. There hasn't been anything that has been very appealing strategically recently. And obviously the valuations are high. There is a lot of people tripping over these businesses, and, therefore, we stayed out of the way and are likely to stay out of the way unless something very, very appealing strategically comes along at the right return levels or price levels. So, therefore, you should expect that if we end up doing a financing at some point, it's going to add to the excess cash in the company and it will be deployed over time in terms of buybacks at a very opportunistic level. The last thing that I would say is, you've got to take a view on the market. And we view the market will be volatile, will be choppy, for a lot of reasons. People are trying to find their footing on monetary policy and fiscal policy. They're trying to find their footing on geopolitical risk and midterm elections in the U.S. and so on and so forth. So, we think it will be a target-rich environment to be opportunistic in buying back shares, if it does materialize.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, Henry. And then just one follow-up on the comment on integration of the risk and analytics into Thomson Eikon. It seems like a definite positive. Frankly, I'm surprised you weren't already integrated there. So, maybe just talk about that effort and any impact it could have on sales in the near to medium-term.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, look, in terms of the last piece, these things takes time, right? And some of these partnerships work well and some of them may be slower. But, importantly, we have a very strong philosophy at MSCI that we are increasingly executing on more forcefully of – if you look at the analytics product line, you can divide it up between content: the equity risk model data, the fixed income risk model data, the multi-asset class risk model data, a lot of our analytical libraries like the performance attribution algorithm, the Value-at-Risk algorithms and the prepayment models and all of that, think of that as content. And then think of Eikon and BarraOne and RiskManager and things like that as the workflow application that helps our client use that content or enable that content. So, anyhow, we have an open architecture in which we would like to put our content in every other application that exists in the world so that the client has a choice. They can either use that content in their own proprietary application. They can use it in third-party applications like Eikon or FactSet or others like that or they can use it with our own applications. So, in order to really – the way to look at is that if we sell five units for every unit of content, we like to sell 20 units for every unit of content no matter where in the world and no matter what at the choice of the client. So you're going to increasingly see us do more of this.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. You've highlighted fixed income a number of times over the past few calls and you've made strides on analytics and multi-asset class side. And with regard to benchmarking, I noticed on slide 6 the ESG fixed income indices. So I was hoping you could just update us on your capabilities in fixed income benchmarking products and sort of what's next in that category?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure. I'll make a few brief observations. So our focus in fixed income benchmarking is on innovation. So we're looking at a range of investment strategies in fixed income and we have been consulting with clients around them. So, as you have noted, our fixed income analytics are a critical part of our broader multi-asset class analytics. And in turn, we believe that being able to help clients solve fixed income portfolio construction questions or opportunities is central to that fixed income analytics opportunity. So the short answer is we're focused on fixed income strategies, and it's tied in more broadly with our broader One MSCI fixed income analytics and multi-asset class strategy. And you'll see more of that as we progress this year.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask about ESG as well just given the strong performance this quarter. Could you just talk about in terms of product sets, like, is it asset managers are buying the data, the ratings? Is it the ESG research reports, or is there something else? And could you also just give us an update on the competitive landscape in ESG? That would be really helpful. Thank you.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure. Okay, sure. Yeah. So, asset managers are primarily buying the research which manifests itself both in written research reports on individual companies as well as on data feeds with various ratings and other content in them which they integrate into their investment process to ensure that their portfolios are either compliant to certain specific ES&G criteria or that they're aware of those type of risks or even opportunities. So, that's the main driver there. The additional driver is that we spend enormous amounts of time with the very large global asset owners such as pension funds, sovereign wealth, et cetera. And those type of actors, particularly those who have a public face, are increasingly setting mandates both indexed and active using ES&G indexes. And, finally, we've seen very attractive growth in ES&G ETFs. So, that category, while relatively modest, I referenced it in my comments earlier, is growing at a very, very, very dramatic pace. And in view of its size, we see that there's still enormous upside there.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And does anyone compete with you in ESG?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Oh yes. I'm sorry. Yeah. So, we have a range of – I would say, that our competitors are mostly localized still in ES&G. So, there are a number of players both whether in EMEA or in the U.S. Some clearly are bigger well-known market names such as Bloomberg, are starting to operate in the ES&G area. But for now, I think it's fair to say that it's a fairly fragmented landscape where our role as a leader is pretty clear.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. Analytics saw some good improvement again this quarter. Can you remind us of the long-term financial targets there? I think you said 30% to 35% margins and how quickly can you get there?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yes. That's right, Joe. Thanks for the question. We're looking at a long-term margin target range of 30% to 35%. We've been making some really good progress in approaching that over the last several years as we've shown you and as we've talked about on each of the calls here. And I think it will take a little bit of time yet. I think it will take, I'd say, probably another at least 18 months to 2 years, 2.5 years to get solidly and consistently being in that range. And, again, it bounces up and down a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But I think in another 18 months to 2, 2.5 years we should be in that range.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. And then my follow up, I was wondering how cushioned do you think you are from market volatility or a downturn. I guess I ask because it sounds like your product suite is expanding. And then just for point of clarification. Do you also have relationships with FactSet and S&P Capital IQ? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, look, I think, the majority of our revenues are coming from subscription revenues that lied in either a huge upstream in the environment or lied a downturn in the environment. So, therefore, we're pretty insulated from either big bullish environments or various environments over time. And it's pretty sticky obviously, as you know. Then obviously minority of our revenues are coming from either asset-based fees or in the case of ETF or institutional passive or transaction-based fees. Now, there are very strong secular trends going on in these areas that when there is a market downturn, obviously, there will be market depreciation, but there's also inflows into this given that secular trend. One other thing that we have observed over the years, and I don't know if it's going to happen all the time, but is that in periods of significant market volatility, a lot of asset owners that want to be equitized, meaning they don't withdraw from the equity market, sometimes take passive approaches rather than active approaches. So, I would not bet that in a market downturn there will be both a market depreciation and a significant outflow of investment from institutional investors that retail investors make. But I think we're very comfortable with where we are there. And we also have a lot of scenarios to the extent that there are huge corrections or better markets. We have quite a lot of levers in the company to tighten or reduce our expense base to ensure that we protect some, maybe not all of it, but some of the profits of the company.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, Joe, we do a lot of scenario analysis and scenario planning both to the upside and the downside to say what will we do if these set of conditions materializes. And to Henry's point, we have various levers that we have identified and analyzed and prioritized to say, if there is a downturn environment, if we are to – how do we act, what do we do. And I call it our downturn playbook but we've got a prioritized list of things that we go to. And it's the normal sort of variable, sort of, costs that you would think about in terms of compensation-related costs, and timing of things, and other discretionary expenses. So, we do a lot of the scenario planning and day by day, daily monitoring of the situation.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, what I would add to all of this more philosophically is that we love to be hedged at MSCI. Some people call it diversification. I call it hedge in which we want to have bet in Asia, and the Americas, in Europe. So, if one region of the world is not doing that great, the other region of the world is going to do that well. We want to be hedged between U.S. markets, developed ex-U.S. market and emerging market. Sometimes the U.S. market is doing great so we have a lot of upside there. If the U.S. market is not doing well, but Europe and developed Asia is doing well, we go there, and in emerging markets, likewise. We want to be hedged on currencies, right. If the dollar gets strong, we win. If the dollar gets weak, we win. If the stock price goes up, we feel very good. If the stock price – our stock price goes down, we buy back a lot of shares. So similarly, if equity values are great, we have a lot of equity offering. If fixed income becomes bigger, that's when we're investing in fixed income, and so on and so forth. So that is philosophically and that is the direction that you're going to see MSCI more and more, how do we make sure we continue to do well in good markets and bad markets. And it doesn't matter where in the world, the action is and where the weakness is.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. The first question is I was hoping you could maybe update us on the integrated selling strategy that you talked about previously. Any metrics on sales force productivity. I know you had introduced a coverage incentive plan and senior account manager program. I know you talked a little bit about it at Q4. Any update on that.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, yeah, quite a lot that we have done in that area, and we still have a huge upside on that. The first thing is that we have obviously put most of our integrated selling effort into our largest client, the top 100, 100-plus clients in the company in which in addition to product salespeople we have good senior relationship manager that integrate all of that and are having dialog at the C-level of the client. And we're happy to report that the run rate growth of that client base is meaningfully higher than the run rate growth of the company and the retention rate is meaningfully lower than the retention – the cancelation rate – the retention rate is meaningfully higher than the retention rate that in the rest of the company. So, that is a very strong proof and has incentivized us to keep going in deepening that approach in those relationships. Secondly, we are increasingly working and training our product salespeople to identify opportunities. So, for example, in one big New York account, the analytics consultant was helping the client sort of integrate a lot of analytics and saw the opportunity that the client will be interested in ESG ratings and ESG indices and all of that and brought in the team to do that and we were able to make a large sale on that front. So, I think this is the way to go because it's really two things. One is that we used to sell only at the user level. We're increasingly selling at the C-suite level. And then second, and related direction, is we don't want to sell widgets, meaning just equity indices or ESG ratings or equity risk models or multi-asset class risks. We want to help clients solve a comprehensive set of solutions that are going to help them generate revenues, lower costs, and scale up their own operations. So, that is a big part of what we're trying to achieve, to combine all of our product lines into a set of outcomes or a set of solutions for the client.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. That's a very – sorry, go ahead.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Just to add some data to that. As Henry said, the run rate, the growth rates on these, we call them the SAM (51:52) accounts, are a couple points higher. The retention rate is a full 2 points higher on these SAM (51:58) accounts, so really strong retention rates. And it seems to be a really effective approach to selling.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you. And just a follow-up question. I'll turn it over. Could you maybe talk about the unvended market in risk management? Specifically, how much client internal spend is not outsourced yet and potentially could be on risk management that there could be upside for you and how you think about that particular piece. Thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Look, so, the vast majority of the money spent is still in-house in building technology, models, cleaning data sets, adding to those data sets and all of that. And our strong view is that the investment industry, particularly the investment management industry, is not going to be able to do that sustainably for the next years. This is a similar approach that happened in Industrial America in the 1980s in which they used to do a lot of things and then they started getting hit by the Japanese which had built a very – an ecosystem of reliance on suppliers and distributors and all of that. So, similarly to that, the investment management industry is beginning to go through a process like that. And, therefore, a big, big part of what we want to do in analytics for the client (53:42) is capitalize on that demand by clients to buy a platform, if they want to think of it that way, a platform that they can run their investment operations on that is going to have data, models, all sorts of data of any kind, all sorts of models of any kind and all sorts of analytics, performance analytics, risk analytics, asset allocation analytics, portfolio construction analytics in all their areas of investment whether it's equity, public equities, private equities, public bond, private bonds, et cetera. And it's very efficient for them to lower cost and to scale up their operations and maintain or make sure they don't lower their own profit margin. So, that's a big runway in analytics and, therefore, that is where we are gradually making investments on. That's where gradually where we're having discussions with the CEO and the CIOs of our client organizations to be able to achieve that kind of way. If we do that well, in terms of the demand, identifying it and in terms of the infrastructure that we're building to achieve that, there's a huge amount of runway in what we call the analytics product line at MSCI.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Your line is now open.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi. So, coming back to the open architecture, so now you have Eikon at Thomson Reuters, where are you not plugged into and how significant of a distribution opportunity is it for analytics or is it just merely incremental?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Sure. So, the primary other distributor that we've had historically is FactSet, which is the sort of largest scale one that we've had over time. So, I think what's happening now is that we are taking the sort of open platform and open content philosophy that Henry alluded to and we will make it significantly easier for third-parties to work with us. So, I think that I would say that we have been philosophically entirely open platform since we bought Barra in 2004. But because of the broad range of different types of feed, databases, et cetera that we've had from all over the business, that's often not been very easy for our clients to integrate. So, one critical aspect of our One MSCI strategy has been significantly enhancing and streamlining our data operations and including making a lot of progress on APIs, et cetera. So, I think we're really just scratching the surface in this category. And if we look forward in the next 12 to 18 months, we'll see this accelerate. But if we look forward even beyond that to, let's say, a three to five-year period, this will clearly become a much more central to how we operate. And we hope to distinguish ourselves not merely by the excellence of our content but also by being significantly more user-friendly to work with having more flexible platform and technology and enabling a whole range of third-parties to work with us in flexible ways. So, I would say that we're really at the beginning of this strategy in terms of making it scalable.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. And a follow-up on ESG. Have you seen any sort of increased demand incrementally or focus on ESG because of the whole gender equality MeToo movement?
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Look, I don't think we can clearly link any specific growth in sales to that. But what it is, it's emblematic of the broader context. So, there has been a whole range of very visible topics such as the gun topic in the United States and there are clearly ongoing huge focus on the environment across the globe. I mean, there's a litany of these. So, in essence, what is happening is that either officially through, let's say, a large public pension funds, a body of retirees who are putting pressure on them not to invest in certain categories of company or exposure, equally individuals through instruments like ETFs are taking active choices not to invest in certain categories. So, the point being is that all these societal pressures of various times ultimately have to reflect themselves in how people allocate capital. And we don't think that that's going away and that it will continue to play out for quite a number of years ahead.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon. So, your press release, your earnings release today talked about how on May 1 the board authorized the company to explore financing options and potentially take the leverage ratio up. What are your current thoughts on the leverage that the business model can support at this point?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: We continue to believe that as we have believed in the last few years that a gross leverage of 3 to 3.5 times is the right one. We did a lot of extensive analysis in terms of particularly the sort of the return on equity. If you had a ratio lower than that or higher than that, will that impact the return on the valuation and the return on equity? So, that's what we – I don't think it has changed at all. And, therefore, if we drop significantly from that range, we will want to access the market. And if we do a financing maybe within that range or maybe higher than that range, I think the issue is that these things are discrete events. You cannot continuously obviously do it in a way that you remain within a very, very specified range, right.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So, it is my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Andrew Wiechmann, Head of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Development, for some closing comments or remarks.
Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your continued support. As always, feel free to reach out with any follow-up questions or additional clarifications. And we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. Thank you, again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program. And we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Wiechmann, Head of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Andrew Wiechmann: Thank you, Daniel. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, and are governed by the language on the second slide of today’s presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings. During today’s call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You’ll find reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 26 to 30 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chief Executive Officer; Baer Petit, our new President; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thanks, Andy. I apologies for a little bit of scratchy voice and cough. Like many American now, I’m battling a cold. As Andy indicated, Baer Pettit, our President will be joining us on this call and will be joining us going forward. As some of you know, Baer has worked side by side with me for over 18 years and building this great company. I will provide a brief intro, and then pass it on to Baer for – go our few slides and then Kathleen for the financial review. As you can see by the full-year results on Slide 4, we are seeing the enormous potentials and power of the MSCI franchise and the progress that we have made perfecting this – our go-to-market strategy, our continued company innovation and the enhanced capabilities that we’ve been building across our software applications and services, all of which have been delivered as one integrated company. These record results and strong performance have not happened by accident. They reflect a very strong progress that we’ve made over the last few years that we’ve been reporting to you on our organization, and how we’re executing against our – both our strategic and financial roadmap. So we saw also an acceleration in some of our key leading indicators with subscription run rate growth of 11% versus 7% in 2016. We saw recurring net new sales for the quarter and the year with growth of 60% in Q4 and 37% for the full-year, reflecting again the strong progress we have made as an organization and as a team, in this particular case, in product development and client engagement. We remain absolutely committed to continue to generate positive operating leverage for our shareholders through our relentless focus on enhancing productivity throughout the company. Kathleen will discuss in more detail, but it’s also worth noting that we will be benefiting significantly from the newly passed U.S. tax reform law in 2018, both in terms of a lower effective tax rate going forward and very importantly the ability to repatriate a meaningful amount of our international excess cash. As in prior calls, we want to tell you, we remain absolutely committed on optimizing and having the most efficient capital structure in our company and returning any excess capital back to shareholders along the lines of the same principles that we have outlined in the past. So in sum, we expect all of this will further enhance, what we call, our financial algorithm. We’ll continue to drive very attractive long-term shareholder returns. Let me turn it over to Baer now.
Baer Pettit: Thank you, Henry. Slide 5 illustrates the increasingly important role that we play within the investment industry. The content, applications and services that we provide to our clients are mission-critical to their core investment activities, such as allocating assets, constructing and optimizing portfolios and understanding and managing investment risk and performance. Because we are central to our clients’ core activities, we’ve gained unique insights into their investments needs and key objectives. Furthermore, because of our success, our products have become established within the industry as a common framework for defining and measuring investment risk and return. The framework that we delivered to our clients provide, for example, a framework for defining the universe of investable equity securities provided by our All Country World Index, or ACWI, a common language for defining and measuring the performance of a specific market or a strategy, such as that provided by our equity and real estate benchmark indexes; a common language for understanding the absolute and relative environmental, social and government attributes of an issuer securities, such as that provided by our ES&G content and indexes; and a common language for defining and understanding the systematic drivers of risk and return in a security or a portfolio through our widely-accepted, multi-asset class risk platform, our world-renowned factor models and our recently introduced factor box and factor classification system for commonly used factors. Because our offerings provide frameworks for analyzing aspects of the investment process, a broad range of participants within the investment industry provide us with their thoughts and insights. They provide viewpoints on how to more effectively measure our market or calculate risk and return, as well as their thinking around the latest investment trends and additional tools that may be required to capitalize on those trends. Our ability to synthesize this feedback from all parts of the investment industry increasingly positions us as a thought leader around emerging investment trends. This feedback allows us to create new content, applications and services, and modify our existing ones to make them more effective. This virtuous circle has allowed us to stay at the forefront of key industry trends like global investing, ES&G and Factor investing and multi-asset class risk and performance management. Because of this feedback loop, clients increasingly want access to tools and knowledge across the firm, not just from a single product line, with the large majority of our clients using products and services from more than one of our product lines. During 2017, we achieved several key milestones and witnessed several notable events that reinforce the growing relevance and importance of MSCI. As previously reported in September 2017, there were approximately $12.4 trillion of assets benchmarked to our indexes globally. As of January 30, there were over $807 billion of ETF assets, or one-fifth of the equity ETF market moving to our indexes. The ETF assets linked to our indexes are up more than 57% from one year ago. Additionally, we’ve received an unprecedented level of industry attention in media coverage around index inclusion events, such as the announcement of the coming inclusion of China A-shares, the consultation on the potential inclusion of the Saudi Arabia market into our emerging market index, as well as around the growing significance of ES&G investing and the value of MSCI ES&G content and indexes. Please turn to Slide 7, where we highlight some of the recent initiatives that we have been pursuing to fuel our integrated franchise. We are increasingly taking an integrated approach to engaging with our clients and are spending more time with C-level executives, where we are becoming an even more important partner by helping them to understand emerging trends and how MSCI can help them to take advantage of those trends. We have also introduced regional operating committees, which help to optimize our go-to-market strategy for each region to address the specific needs and business models of our clients. In addition to increasing levels of engagement and the sales process by MSCI’s senior executives, notably by Henry; our Chief Operating Officer, Laurent Seyer; and myself, we are continuing to hone a consistent approach to delivering the full suite of MSCI products and capabilities. As a result of the senior level approach to selling, together with the introduction of our coverage incentive plan compensation program and our senior account manager program, we have achieved increased levels of growth from our largest clients, with 19% year-over-year run rate growth from those clients who have greater than $2 million in run rate and a 14% improvement in sales productivity since 2015. We have also been heavily focused on providing anonymous content and enhanced applications and services across the organization to better serve our clients. By having integrated client coverage, research, data, and technology group supporting all product lines, we’re better suited to share our unique IP and leverage our differentiated know-how to deliver innovative and high-quality content. Answering executive-level feedback from our integrated approach to clients, we’re leveraging our integrated research and data teams to deliver differentiated new index models, as well as differentiated multi-asset, risk and stress testing models. Additionally, we’re levering – leveraging our integrated research data and technology teams to release new applications and services that empower our clients to use our content more efficiently and more effectively. For example, services like index metrics and our custom index development offerings help our clients understand the factor in ESG attributes of an index and to build new indexes. Additional Analytics capabilities released in recent years like benchmark aggregation, performance attribution, data management and reconciliation, and enhancement to our regulatory services, including our liquidity analytics and services that help clients meet their end or regulatory requirements help our clients to address key operating challenges. These additional capabilities together with enhanced content in areas like fixed income analytics have helped drive a 11% year-on-year run rate growth in the fourth quarter within our multi-asset class analytics offerings. We saw $46 million of total growth sales in 2017 from multi-asset class analytics, where fixed income capabilities were a key driver of our success, with $12 million of total new sales associated with fixed income analytics. Our integrated franchise continues to be a significant competitive advantage for us and an important driver of our attractive growth trajectory. On Slide 8, we wanted to highlight two of the more notable areas of content innovation, where having an integrated franchise has allowed us to benefit across products and client used cases. By having well-established position, reputation and research team in factor analytics, we have been able to create a cohesive and systematic multi-factor set of index families that is being rapidly adopted as benchmarks and for content mandates and ETFs. We’re uniquely positioned to preserve right tools for analyzing, communicating, and implementing factor strategies. As of December 31, 2017, we had over $208 million of run rate related to factors across all of our products, and we have seen a two-year CAGR of the factor-related run rate from 2015 to 2017 of 16%. Our factor analytics tools help investors to understand the factor attributes of a portfolio and to construct portfolios to achieve specific objectives, while our factor indexes provide the mechanism to implement those portfolios. Similarly, as ES&G considerations are increasingly central to the investment process, MSCI has established position in ES&G content, our broad and deep security coverage and our consistent systematic ratings framework provides a natural foundation for ES&G indexes. Furthermore, our established research and deep relationships with asset owners have accelerated the adoption of ES&G indexes within the investment process. As of December 31, 2017, we have over $83 million of run rate in ES&G content and ES&G indexes, and we have seen a two-year CAGR of the ES&G-related run rate from 2015 to 2017 of 31%. Of note, the iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF became the first and only ES&G ETF to cross the $1 billion mark in AUM. We believe we’re well-positioned to continue to identify and benefit from emerging trends in the investment industry in the future. With that, I’ll turn it over to Kathleen to discuss our financial results, segment results and guidance for the year ahead. Kathleen?
Kathleen Winters: Thanks, Baer, and good day to, everyone, on the call. I’ll start on Slide 9 and take you through our financial performance for the quarter. We delivered another quarter, with double-digit revenue growth, 14%, driven by growth in asset-based fees of 41% and recurring subscription revenue growth of 9%. During 2017, we saw AUM and ETF linked to our indexes grow to $744 billion, a 55% increase, more than half of that increase came from cash inflows into ETF linked to MSCI indexes. Operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses, which included elevated non-recurring severance expenses in the quarter increased year-over-year by 8.4% and 10.5%, respectively. Full-year expenses of $615 million were in line with our most recent guidance provided during our last earnings call. Severance expense was $7.7 million for the quarter, an increase of $6.9 million from the prior year, of which $4.8 million was within Analytics. These efficiency actions have an associated cost save of approximately $13 million, with $9 million related to Analytics and will enable us to allocate resources to our key growth areas. We delivered attractive operating leverage with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 170 basis points and adjusted EPS growing 42%. On Slide 10, you can see the drivers of adjusted EPS growth in Q4. The biggest drivers of the increase in adjusted EPS were strong top line growth and continued alignment of our tax profile with our global operating footprint. This growth was partially offset by an increase in expenses related to ongoing investments in severance to achieve efficiencies. The alignment of our tax profile with our operating footprint, the impact of various discrete items and the positive impacts of share-based compensation excess tax windfall benefits contributed $0.11 to the adjusted EPS growth. This was partially offset by FX. We recorded a net estimated charge of $34.5 million associated with tax reform, which included a tax charge related to repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities. This charge is excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Similarly, we expect that any future charges resulting from refinements two and further guidance on tax reform will also be excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Exclusive of these non-recurring tax reform related charges, our adjusted tax rates for the fourth quarter and for the full-year were 22% and 27.5%, respectively. Slide 11 provides the full-year summary of financial performance. As you can see, we delivered very strong results for the full-year with revenue growth of 10.7% and adjusted EPS growth of 31.4%. Free cash flow came in at $355 million for the year consistent with our guidance. As a reminder, 2016 free cash flow experienced several favorable non-recurring and timing-related items related to tax reforms, prior period tax over payments, as well as early payments from clients that drove an elevated free cash flow level in 2016. Adjusting for these items, the normalized 2016 free cash flow was $340 million. The growth relative to the prior year normalized free cash flow reflects the strong financial performance for the year, partially offset by higher interest payments. Although collections were higher, they were somewhat slower than anticipated, attributable mostly to our tax realignment work as we adjusted billing entities for some of our international clients. Overall, we’re very happy with our execution and results in 2017, and we’re excited about our momentum heading into 2018. On Slide 12, we’d like to share the exceptional sales and net new sales performance we saw as we close 2017. We delivered record gross sales, recurring sales and recurring net new sales in the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2017. We executed well in the quarter and converted a significant amount of pipeline into signed deals, particularly within Analytics. Index run rate grew 23% with Q4 being another quarter of double-digit subscription run rate growth. Analytics demonstrated a nice acceleration in subscription run rate growth of 8%, or 7% ex-FX. The 7% ex-FX run rate is up from 3.8% in 2016, a clear acceleration of growth rate. We experienced particular strength in EMEA and Asia with subscription run rate growth in Q4 of 14% and 13%, respectively. While the subscription growth in the Americas remained in line with the growth in past years at 8%. We’re seeing the benefits of our enhanced go-to-market strategy, our continued innovation and product enhancement and the increasing power of our integrated franchise. One point to mention is that, we’ve seen a higher percentage of our annual sales occurring in the fourth quarter and a lower percentage in the first-half of the year. Specifically, we’ve seen about one-third of our annual recurring sales booked in the fourth quarter in each of the last two years, compared to 27% to 28% in each of the prior three years. It’s difficult to say, whether this will be a continuing trend, but this change in linearity has possibly been driven by the budgetary processes of our clients, as well as our coverage incentive plan that was implemented in 2016. We’re keeping a close eye on it, as we build the pipeline for 2018. We’re very pleased with the strong performance in 2017 sales and the team is now focused on continuing to build and execute on the 2018 pipeline. Now let’s turn to our segment results on Slide 14. Index revenue grew by a significant 22% this quarter, the highest rate of growth since 2011. This included strong growth in ETF-related revenue due to cash inflows and market appreciation, growth in non-ETF passive product revenue and exchange traded futures and options products. Index subscription revenue grew at 12%, reflecting our continued sales momentum and high retention rates with growth in new products and traction in our client segments. In the Analytic segment, we delivered revenue growth of 3%. The growth in revenues typically lags the growth in run rate. Contributing to this lag, we’ve seen the onboarding and implementation periods for some large clients lengthened, reflecting growing complexity of client needs. We’re beginning to see the benefits of our fixed income investments with $12 million of total gross sales in 2017. Also, we continue to invest in our new Analytics platform, additional service capabilities and our go-to-market efforts to drive revenue growth to higher levels. Finally, our all other segments delivered revenue growth of 21.5%. percent. ESG revenue was up 24%, driven by continued strong recurring sales, which were up 47% for the quarter and 32.5% for the year. We believe ESG is in the early stages of its evolution. ESG has the potential to become a key component of investment mandates throughout the world and we’re well positioned to provide a framework for analyzing ESG issues that will be widely adopted. As we have discussed in the past, we’re investing to leverage new technologies in natural language processing and machine learning to enhance efficiency and drive productivity in this product. Next, in terms of real estate, revenue was up 17% on a reported basis, and up approximately 12% on an FX adjusted basis. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by growth in our market information product and strong momentum in North America. We continue to focus on further improving the performance of this segment with initiatives to enhance sales, product capabilities and productivity. We believe there is an attractive long-term market opportunity for this offering. Slide 15 and 16 provides some additional detail on the Index segment. On Slide 15, we show four main categories of index modules and the four-year run rate CAGR for each categories. Despite see pressure and headwinds on traditional active asset managers, we continue to deliver consistent revenue growth, driven by the strength of our offerings and new products and some high-growth client segments. Newer modules, such as our Factor & ESG Modules have been increasingly in demand. We’re seeing more and more investment mandates, which include Factor & ESG considerations, such as minimum volatility, value, momentum, low carbon, as well as socially responsible and governance-related considerations. Similarly, we’re witnessing very strong demand for our custom and specialized index offerings, which help clients achieve a differentiated or unique adaptive. We’re also continuing to gain traction further penetrating client segments, such as broker dealers, wealth management and hedge funds. More broadly, as passive and index-based indexing represents an increasingly larger portion of global assets, there is an increasing need from all markets participants to understand the underlying indexes. We continue to be excited by the ongoing prospects of our subscription revenue business. Turning to Slide 6, we show additional detail on our asset-based fees. Starting with the upper left chart, we recorded strong growth in asset-based fee revenue across all index-linked investment products. As of December 31, there were a total of 992 ETFs benchmark to MSCI indexes, an increase of 9% from the per year, or roughly 22% of the equity ETF market. Revenue from non-ETF passive products was up 28.3%, reflecting strong growth in institutional passive and index-based mutual fund AUM, including higher fee-type products like factor and ESG. Revenue from exchange traded futures and options continued its exceptional growth, increasing 41% and reflecting the developing liquidity pool and broadening trading community around multi-markets, multi-currency index futures and options. On the bottom left, you see that in addition to the very strong cash flows into and market appreciation – and market performance in the developed markets outside the U.S., we experienced strong AUM growth in both emerging markets and the U.S. In the lower right chart, you can see that average run rate basis point fee for the period at 3.04. While the decline in fee rate has slowed, our primary focus is not on driving higher fee rates or moderating the decline in fee rates. We are very focused on increasing volume and market share and driving long-term growth in run rate. Turning to Analytics, Slide 17 provides you with summary of the margin and growth trajectory over the last several years. On the upper half of this slide, we show the Analytics margin progression starting with 2014. During 2013 and 2014, we invested heavily to bolster the technology infrastructure and the client service organization. We then undertook a series of restructuring initiatives during 2015 and 2016, which combines several products and sales organizations, rationalized and streamlined several functions, as well as prioritized investments into the key product and client growth areas that were most strategic for the firm. We continued the restructuring in 2017 with our Q4 realignment and reprioritization initiative, which resulted in a slight decline in the margin in 2017 to 27.4%. Excluding the increase in year-over-year severance expense, the Analytics margin would have been above 28%. We’ve largely right-sized the expense base and focused our investments in key growth areas. We’re now working on achieving acceleration in revenue growth to drive further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion into our long-term targeted range of 30% to 35%. Over the last few quarters, we’ve seen a gradual improvement in the run rate growth to the current level of 8%. In the fourth quarter, we saw recurring sales up 35.5% and recurring net new sales up 178%, as a result of having both strong sales and a reduced level of cancels. It’s important to remember, however, that quarters can be lumpy, but we continue to remain cautiously optimistic about this momentum. We saw strength in Equity Analytics, as clients increasingly need our content sets and applications to differentiate themselves by more effectively constructing portfolios to achieve their desired investment objectives. Similarly, our multi-asset class content applications and services help clients manage, understand and support risk and performance across single or enterprise-wide multi-asset class portfolios. We’re helping clients manage and reconcile data, as well as meet regulatory requirements, such as end port. And our applications and services also help our clients operate more efficiently, often delivering services and capabilities at a fraction of the cost of internal operations or multiple vendor solutions. Turning to the next section, Slides 19 and 20, provide an update on our capital, liquidity and our 2018 guidance. On Slide 19, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. As a result of tax reform, we can now more efficiently access a significant portion of our cash held outside of the United States. In terms of leverage this quarter, we are at 3.2 times well within our stated range of 3 to 3.5, as a result of growth in our adjusted EBITDA. Although, there are significant benefits for some tax reform, we are not making any changes to our capital allocation strategy. Even with the access to additional cash overseas, we will continue to approach share repurchases in line with past practice by repurchasing more shares when there’s softness in the market and when we have more excess cash and fewer shares when volatility is low and we have lower excess cash. We continue to review repurchases as an important part of our return on capital strategy and will continue to repurchase shares opportunistically. On Slide 20, we share our 2018 guidance. As you can see by our expense guidance, we will continue to be diligent at balancing investment activity with controlling costs. In addition, I’ll point out that our long-term targets remain the same. As we reflect on 2017 and the company’s ongoing evolution, I want to highlight one element of the company’s transformation of which we are particularly proud. We’ve been intensely focused on creating an organization with world-class financial management that will enable us to effectively make and implement decisions based on appropriate information and ultimately to allocate capital to its highest return uses. I’m excited to say that, we’ve made enormous progress enhancing our financial and process discipline. We’ve improved our systems, processes and culture, which has enabled us to quantitatively track and manage our investments and expense base to drive continued innovation, effective capital allocation and enhanced return on investment and shareholder returns. Of course, there are always additional improvements to make and we very much have a culture of continuous improvement, but we are very proud of the progress the team has made in this area. In summary, 2017 was an exceptional year for MSCI and reflects our commitment to executing against our strategy. We’re uniquely positioned to continue to innovate and assist our clients by providing mission-critical tools and services to meet their evolving investment needs. We remain excited about our growth opportunities for 2018 and beyond and we very much look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, we’ll open the lines to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. I want to start where you actually closed, which is the capital side. I think, Kathleen, you mentioned there’s no change to capital allocation. However, you’re building up a lot of cash. And I hear you that markets could get more volatile and you want to have some some dry powder for buybacks. But we’ve been saying this for a year, markets keep on going up. So at some point, I wonder how much it is in the best interest of shareholders to keep piling up cash? I mean, if you’re really excited about growth, maybe you should be buying back your stock, or maybe you should rise a dividend. So maybe you can address that a little bit. And maybe also, Henry, how does M&A factor in this? Because again, you’re building up some cash here, and it might be some things out that I could fit nicely into your offering? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Thanks, Alex, that’s a good question. Look, we’re very, very keenly focused on organic growth in the company. We believe that we have a lot of the footprint necessary to capitalize on all the opportunities that we see in the market. And if there’s any M&A, is kind of fillers here and there. But there’s also a lot of bullions in the M&A market. So we look at certain assets and the evaluation has been stretched. So we have felt that we can do that organically and fixed income Analytics is an example of that for ESG, potential is our examples of that, et cetera. So we’re not really converse and to play therefore any kind of bigger acquisitions, if anything it’s just smaller icons alike. And one area we’re very focused on is technology, natural language processing, artificial intelligence and things like that, right? So therefore, that brings the question of the capital back to what do we believe if it’s not there, right, if it’s not for any kind of acquisitive growth. Look, I – we believe that we earn a bull market, and sooner or later, there’s going to be a correction and we want to capitalize on that. And obviously, if a long time goes by and it doesn’t happen, then we’l have to reassess and move forward. But for now, we – the tax law just past. The excess cash currently on the balance sheet to date in New York or in the U.S. is $250 million. We have not been yet able to bring it back. It will take few months to bring it back, because there’s a lot of procedures associated with it. We think it could be up to $350 million or so that we can bring back. We’re still analyzing all of that, because we don’t want to pay large withholding taxes in various places. And that now creates a little bit of a larger amount of excess cash we can deploy, now we’ll be patient. I think, at the end of the day, look, I realized what you’re saying. But I also don’t want to wake up and say, we deployed all these cash back to shares and then a month later, there was a correction and we didn’t capitalize on.
Alex Kramm:
Kathleen Winters: Yes. Just to echo what Henry said, look, we think there’s about 350 and possibly more than that that will bring back. But it doesn’t come back immediately, it does come back most likely in the first – by the end of the first-half. But a lot has to happen to get that back in terms of auditing of legal entities, their withholding tax in local jurisdiction. So we want to make sure we are smart and diligent and we’re brining it all back in the most cost-efficient manner back we can, and we’ll continue to be disciplined from a capital allocation standpoint and wait for those moments of volatility.
Alex Kramm: Fair enough. Thank you. And then just secondly, I guess, to shift on to the cost guide, I think, you didn’t give a lot of detail there. So two things really that I’m curious about. One, how about FX, like what kind of – I mean, I think FX historically when the dollar weakens and that’s not a good thing for your cost base and your margin. So just wondering, what you’re going to build in, in terms of rate there? And then secondly, we’ve been at this goal deduction environment as we just talked about, and obviously, your asset-based fees are going up, et cetera. If that actually turns around like Henry is waiting for, it sounds like, I mean, what kind of flex do you have on the cost base? Thank you.
Kathleen Winters: Yes, a couple of questions you have there. So from an FX standpoint, I mean, you’re right, in terms of the impact to us, but it’s typically very minimal. We are typically – have some good natural hedges in place. And so we see really small impacts from an FX perspective. In terms of the ADF environment and AUM levels, that does turn around and we see a correction downward movement. Obviously, yes, we get impacted by that. And as the percentage of our ADF fees grow as a percentage of total company, there is more of an impact there. So we are really, really diligent at doing scenario planning, and saying, okay, we’re going to build a base plan, but less scenario plan for both an upside and a downside. And if a downside happens, what do we do and what are our levers. So we’ve been pretty detailed about looking at what levers we do have in terms of variable expenses. And in particular, we would look at things like the variable component of compensation and we watch very closely. And furthermore, we kind of track as we go. We plan the year and we say, yes, we wanted to do a certain level of investment spending. But we are tracking it very closely as we go before we kind of pull the trigger on each level of spending.
Alex Kramm: That’s very helpful. Thanks, again.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the improvement in the Analytics. How sustainable is that? I know we’ve been building up to this for a couple of quarters, and what’s really paying off you there?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, good question, Joe. The – obviously, this is – has been hard work for the last three years or so. And I just want to reiterate what Kathleen said, which is a quarter doesn’t make a year. We feel very pleased and very proud of what we did in Q4. But this is kind of a product line that gets lumpy on us. So it don’t normalize the fourth quarter yet. I mean, we’ve got to wait that four or five quarters of similar performance before we feel like that, right? And that’s how we look at it internally. And so what has worked for us is an extreme focus on repositioning the product line, right? And focusing on the areas of the product line that are core and we want to grow and harvest parts of the product line that where we want to invest in or spend. And obviously, the core of the product line is equity analytics, fixed income analytics, and multi-asset class risk and performance. And we do have a – I don’t know, $20 million of run rate that is not the core that is being harvested and that’s growing at a lower growth rate and that’s always that obviously, we’re managing. So that’s one thing that has helped us put the resources in the right places. Then the position with the product line with the client base, let’s say, equity analytics. Everyone is trying to invest along factor lines, or understand what their factor portfolios are. So we are more proactively talking and consulting with clients as to how they can use this set of risk models and this set of analytics to be able to help them, particularly the active manager clients and the hedge fund clients, they’re sort of long – equity long short hedge fund clients. So that has created a meaningful amount of growth for us on equity analytics. On multi-asset class analytics and risk, the initial position of this product line was, okay, we’re going to put up a tool in your shop, it’s going to grow performance, attribution and risk analysis and you’re going to use it for that. And that’s obviously is a primary use case. But a lot of our active manager clients are saying, it has to be more than that. I got to be able to use this framework to help me scale the business and cut a lot of costs inside the organization to cut a lot of cost. So we go in there and help them integrate the thing and that’s why somewhat it delays in recognition of revenue, right, integrated thing in a way that it fulfils those two objectives that it is a platform for them to scale their business, communicate internally, and report to their clients and understand risk and performance. But at the same time, it’s got to be a way for them to create efficiencies and lower the cost structure and eliminate a lot of resources. So that has helped us a lot. Lastly has been fixed income analytics. We started initially investing in a lot of fixed income analytics portfolio- fixed income portfolio analytics in the context of the changes that are going on in that place with the acquisition of point by Bloomberg, and that was the initial focus and we continue to do that. But what we found out was that that we had a lot more payback. If we took a lot of that fixed income analytics and play it hard on the multi-asset class risk and performance and go get a large mandates for banks, for example, or big fixed income players. So this – last quarter, we are extremely proud that two of the most significant fixed income managers and banks subscribed to our multi-asset class risk and portfolio analytics, largely on the basis of our fixed income offering. One large bank in Asia and one of the largest fixed income asset manager dedicated fixed income asset manager, particularly with a lot of our loan offerings and things like that. So that has driven the revenue growth and all the efforts in integration, where the client has driven the local cancels.
Kathleen Winters: Yes. Let me just reiterating a little bit of what Henry touched on. Look, Q4 was obviously a great quarter for analytics, and frankly, we’ve seen some really nice momentum during the course of the year. If you look at the recurring subscription sales for Analytics, remember, we started Q1 being down from a year-over-year perspective and then trended upward each and every quarter this year, so really nice improvement. And what we’re seeing some improvement in the operating environment, we also are seeing that the covered organization is executing really well, and remember, we have our sales incentive program in place now since 2016. So great quarter. We’re beginning to see what we’ve been talking about for a couple of years now in terms of returning to higher growth. But I really want to stress as we know, the quarters can be lumpy in terms of sales and cancels. Q4 had a great combination, where we saw both high sales and low cancels. So we certainly shouldn’t take the Q4 performance and try to extrapolate that or assume every quarter would be that good. We will get some variability on this from quarter-to-quarter.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. And then my second question just, can you talk a little bit about the demand for passive investing heading into 2018? What kind of this trend and how prepared are you for a downtick in AUM, or slowdown in momentum? And now you are going to have more cash available. So I’m wondering how diversified do you think you are if I do think you are, if this is the year that things finally slow? Thanks.
Baer Pettit: Sure. Hi, it’s Baer here. So clearly, we have to distinguish the market movements, which we’re not going to take a specific position on, and you can make a judgment yourself as to how you feel that might end up. But in terms of passive and index investing, we don’t see that there is a change in the outlook. We continue to see increasing allocations from investors, both from institutional and advised investors. So I would say, the trend is continuous. The market level correction could have a slight impact on that. But in terms of the overall direction, we’re not seeing anything that’s different from what we’ve seen over the last quarter’s or years. And it’s also migrating. Obviously, the big part of all of this was market cap. So think of it as transition exposures and markets and sectors around the world. And we doing very well there with the DM part, OEM and all of that the country and everything. But that’s the one chart that we show you there. And now we’re seeing that going into attributes, so these are more or less – almost like less supply-driven, meaning not supply securities, but you know how our objectives in investing in momentum and investing in low –in high-quality stocks or whatever. So that is just in the early stages of a huge evolution. And behind that is now is the ESG component, which is kind of take the market caps and we weigh them on the basis of ESG and manage the portfolio passively or actively. And that’s the early stages and we are by far the best position to capitalize on that. And we’re already beginning to get a little bit of, still very early stages. So this institutionally our clients saying, oh, you got to help me combine the factors and the ESG into one holistic portfolio. So we got a long, long way to go here that will significantly expand the market and our presence in it.
Joseph Foresi: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni Kaplan: Hey, good afternoon. Baer, I think, you mentioned 19% growth from large clients, right? Would you attribute that to more like competitive wins, or pricing, or budget expansion, or is there something else driving that, because I thought that that was a very strong statistics?
Baer Pettit: Sure. I think, it’s all of the above, because there’s such a significant portion of our revenues that is hard to attribute one particular factor. I think, it really is – the most significant element is the deepening of the relationship and their consciousness of what we can offer across the various product lines and critically the connectivity between those. So clearly, we’ve – there has been some price component in it, but less for them than for this – for some of the medium-sized clients actually. But it’s chiefly the deepening of relationships, where they are using more of our tools more broadly within the organization.
Henry Fernandez: And big component of that has been – the – again, the approach we’re taking, as Baer indicated, we’re deepening on the relationship, which is traditionally MSCI has been built by subject matter experts in MSCI, talking to the individual user in the organization of the client. And therefore, obviously, that made it into a product sale very specific to their equities, or fixed income, or risk, or whatever. So the approach that we’re taking and is led by Baer, Laurent and me on the road constantly is to go see the C-level people, the CIO, the CEOs of our largest client. And basically, we go there with a value proposition. And the value proposition is, look, we are a – we have an incredible franchise that can help you achieve your strategic goals and objectives, or creating new products and direct revenue, cutting costs, medium regulatory requirements. Do you want to be a strategic partner? Do you want us to be a strategic partner to you or not? And if you do, let’s do a one day brainstorming session and let’s come up with all the various areas that we can help you achieve your goals and objectives. And so we’ve done a few of those and they’re incredibly powerful. And loan released things come out of that. So that we’re now trying to obviously – we’ve done, I think, quite a lot of cases, but we’re now scaling it to the – I think we have a like 125 clients or so in this category over the – not over them yet, for sure, at a strategic partners level, there is a big commitment of time resources from them and us. But considering those with all of that, yes, they want to embrace us to be partnership.
Toni Kaplan: That’s great. And could you also give us an update on pricing? I think, in index, last year, you were raising prices about 5% to 7%, and also in Analytics, you were raising prices. So could you give us the sort of price increases this year for both segments? Thanks.
Kathleen Winters: Yes. Toni, hi. It was pretty consistent this year with the prior year in terms of both the price increases and price as a percentage of sales for both index and analytics. I mean, we typically try to plan pretty conservatively in terms of how much we’ll get from price. But in fact, in Analytics, we did quite well this year versus how we planned the year. So we’re pretty happy about that.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Christopher Shutler: Hey guys, good morning. On the new factor style box, which we saw the press releases over the last couple of weeks on that. Just talk about what the go-to-market plan is? And then also just stepping back on a factor ETF, how should – what’s your good kind of average fee rates you use for the factor ETFs relative to the plane vanilla flagship?
Henry Fernandez: Okay. So let me take the first one there. So the go-to-market strategy on the factor box. So first of all, the launch that we had was extremely positive and there’s a clearly a big demand in the market from clients to have a common language. And I think that that is true to – definitely through the institutional market, but even much more so in the advisor market. So the plan is to both work on communicating first of all, because we just launched it this framework across all of our client types and then work with them to adopt this chiefly as a method of communicating to their clients about the nature of their portfolios. So we’re early days on this, but the initial response has been extremely positive and we had a quite a number of meetings set up even in the last week or so since we launched in. And obviously, these things don’t happen. I mean, everything at MSCI, as Baer went through in his slide, is a looping system, right? So we have been consulting with a large, large number of clients on this certification for the year-and-a-half or so. So we got enormous amount of feedback and excitement from them, so that’s already baked into even before the kind of official launch of it. Look, on fees on – for example, the fees on factors, we take a fairly similar pricing approach to market cap on ETF and retail funds and things like that. So that’s not that’s different. Obviously, in some domestic markets, if we’re saying we’re launching a factor ETF on MSCI U.S., or in Japan or whatever, it has to be congruent with the pricing of domestic or domestic portfolios in ETF as opposed to government pricing, right? The area where we have gone exceedingly well is in the institutional market, four factors and ESG, which is given the market cap indices, we make good money, but it’s relatively lower compared to ETF and others in the ETF. What we’ve been able to do is significantly ramp up the fees that we get paid in those index portfolios that are institutionally managed, mostly separate accounts or own vehicles by passive managers on factors and ESG. And the principal reason for that is, when we engage with institutional clients on this topic, typically, these decisions have a very material impact on their investment outcomes or process, and the alternatives that they would have to do that are higher fee. So we can both have an attractive fee for ourselves, add value to the clients and provide them with an economic incentive to work with us.
Christopher Shutler: Okay, thanks. And then going back to Analytics just maybe another way of looking at it. I mean, as you look at your – the pipeline stats, I mean, how does the pipeline look today versus in the last couple of quarters? And maybe refresh us on the incentive plan change that you made a couple of years ago and how that could play into seasonality in that business?
Kathleen Winters: Yes. So the pipeline is looking pretty strong right now. And as we look at kind of how pipeline looked going into Q1 last year versus how it looks going in this year, we’re in about the same position. And remember, as I said and given to your seasonality question and your question on the incentive plan, we’re seeing a greater percentage of sales – new sales coming in the fourth quarter and last coming in the first-half. So the sales incentive plan now has the entire sales or coverage organizations aligned to sales and cancels metrics. And we think that’s being very effective. And like I said, you’re seeing that come through in the strength in the Q4 results.
Henry Fernandez: But it’s also – it’s clearly this increase in the fourth quarter versus the rest of the year. Obviously, it’s not just us, right? It is – the clients have increasingly designed budgets for the year and way towards the latter part of the year to see where things are headed in their organization and if there is an extra budget, they want to spend it. So that is gone, right, and going to the following year. So that has played a bit of a role there as well. So maybe in a not more normalized environment and budgetary process of our clients that gets reduced, but that’s becoming a little bit of a new norm right.
Christopher Shutler: All right. And then just a couple of quick cleanup questions. You touched on the cash, the $890 million of cash, assuming that you do repatriate 350-plus of that. How much of the total total cash pay should we ultimately view as excess cash?
Kathleen Winters: We – the amount out of, what I’ll call, the minimum cash balances, the operating cash hasn’t changed from what we historically have said. So $100 million, $125 million in the past we said in the U.S. and about $75 million outside of the U.S., but now it’s tangible right. So you don’t have to think about it in terms of the regions anymore, but just in terms of total excess cash balances. So continue to think about it consistent with what we’ve said previously.
Christopher Shutler: Okay. And then I’m sure it’s going to be in the proxy, but…
Baer Pettit: I’m sorry to interrupt you, try to keep everyone to two questions here, so we can get everyone’s questions. So I apologize…
Christopher Shutler: Okay, fair enough. I’ll – yes, I’ll follow-up offline. Thanks.
Baer Pettit: I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
William Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone. So a question for you on the Analytics strength that you’ve been talking about, very impressive. And I wanted to ask a little bit about where it was coming from specifically as a few big deals versus lots of small deals, and then new clients versus up-selling existing ones? And then also in terms of the timing, if there was anything there other than the seasonality that you’ve highlighted in terms of a secular cyclical change in client demand?
Henry Fernandez: So the – first of all, the hero of the quarter within Analytics was obviously fixed income Analytics in the context of both a multi-asset class offering being subscribed or purchased because of the strength of our fixed income, or the example that I gave of a pure play fixed income manager. So we have more of the pipeline. But again, there would be lumpy. But we’re very excited about that because of all of the investments that we’ve made so far, and new investments that we’ve made but are not yet into the product line. So a year or so ago we are correct team of mortgage repayment models experts in the U.S. and they developed very, very good classic models and all that. And we’re going to put that into the product line and that may help us penetrate the U.S. fixed income market more. So that’s the hero. Yes, increasingly, our Analytics sales and that’s also why they get lumpy are larger deals. So the average or medium ticker is moving up. And now, every quarter, we have a number of million-plus sales that, in the past, was maybe one, and therefore, that’s operating. But in addition to that, we’re also selling a lot of other smaller-ticket items for medium case uses and the like. So it’s a combination of all of that. And the other piece to this thing, as I said, is that we’re positioning this – we use to position it as a tool. We’ll give you a tool, you figure out what to do with it and call us when you have issues. We’re positioning this thing as a solution and the services that need to go with that solution to help the client use the tools, right? And we have some early successes of that, but we definitely are excited about the potential of that coming.
Kathleen Winters: Yes. So just to add a little to that, because we’ve got this mix of both some bigger ticket items, as well as still having a pretty high volume of lower dollar, I’ll call it, sales. We’ve got this high-volume asset, where our systems and processes becomes so important in terms of being able to have the wide system that gives us good timely accurate data and the process to use the systems. The organization has gotten much tighter and we’re much more rigorous about how we use our sales force to enable us to look at pipeline to take that pipeline and put it into the different stages of pipeline and then effectively manage and push those things through pipeline to execution. So the systems and the process is really, really important. From a – just to give a little more color in terms of regionally, we saw strength for Analytics in each and every region. The total net new for the year was very strong across all three regions and things strengthen the Asset Manager segment and the Banking segment, in particular.
William Warmington: Got it. For my second question, I wanted to ask about selective. I’ve been hearing their name a lot lately and wanted to ask about what their no name super low-cost model means for the industry, and if it means anything for MSCI, in particular?
Henry Fernandez: Sure. So I think that they are a perfect normal example of increasing competition in business, in industry that growing very attractively and which clearly is creating enormous opportunity for us. As of today, they are not a material competitor for us. But I would say that our general approach is to really look at any client needs that arise from developments in the industry and try to be as flexibility as we can in serving them. So I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more of these that appear over the next few years. But I think we’re very confident about our value proposition and we’re very confident that we have a very broad range of index solutions, not barely the name benchmarks, but helping our clients create custom indexes and other types of solutions that server their needs. So I think, it’s perfectly normal, capital is competition. We’re comfortable with it and it’s not having a material impact on us today, but we’re not complacent.
William Warmington: Got it. Thank you very much for the insight.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Good afternoon, I guess. My first question is just on the ESG side. It clearly sounds like, it’s getting more and more attention, your numbers are showing it, too. I was just wondering, what the organic versus inorganic opportunities there might look like from your perspective?
Henry Fernandez: It’s – there’s certainly a revolution happening in this space, which is, in a small integrated world, we all have to be cognizant. Of the sustainability of all of our institutions was occasional government or religious or whatever, political, et cetera. In this case, it’s obviously, the institutions of capital it’s more of enterprise which is companies and investors in those companies or issuers of bond then investors and issuers of bond. So everyone is focused on being universal owners that followed by the investor for example, I want to a company for a very long time. I need to ensure the long-term sustainability of that company. I don’t want to ensure that they’re not going to get into social programs because of sexual harassment or environmental issues or obviously, government issues. So this is spreading pretty well and fast in the investment industry and we’re aiming that because of our position in the marketplace. So I see a huge amount of runway there. Secondly, we are extremely well positioned to use this low ESG content into a variety of ways. Clearly, content itself like ratings, we’re the number one rating agency, so to speak in the industry matters, equities and fixed income right now. Secondly, – the turning those ratings into weeks, into portfolios and from ability. And then thirdly, which is an area that we’re putting in place is how do we use ESG as factors – market factors that determine incentive risk and portfolio – incentive risk and return on portfolio. So we’re well positioned to be the integrated provider of all of that to our clients. So a lot of our growth is organic and is largely going to remain organic. We have looked at our few acquisitions here and there. They were more complicated to buy them and integrate them to do it ourselves, so we passed and – but we continue to look particularly in each areas. But right now, it’s been focused on organic growth, right, not inorganic.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it. And then the other question I had was just broadly around method and maybe it’s too early for you guys to see anything. But any trends you’re seeing within your clients in response to that regulation going live now?
Baer Pettit: Yes. Look, I think, it is quite early. Clearly, the – there’s kind of, what I’ll call, the technical first moment of executing on some of the transparency, which I think in terms of our systems everything has been fine. And I think, in terms of the competitive landscape and the impact on our clients, it is really too early. So, there’s – clearly, there has been some prognosis amongst the market analyst that the impact on the – for example, the equity analyst industry could be dramatic. But it’s just too early, so we’ll have to see how that plays out during the course of the year.
Henry Fernandez: Look, over time, it’s not negative for us, maybe a positive. There’s clearly a change of business model here, and there’s intermediation of “research,” if you want to think about it that way. So question is what role will MSCI play? Nontraditional role that MSCI play to fill in the vacuum of providing a different kind of research to evaluate securities and portfolios and the like. And we we’re kicking up sort of brainstorming session about vocabulary way too early to tell.
Manav Patnaik: All right. Thanks for that, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Anjaneya Singh: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask the question on the expense guidance earlier another way. It seems the midpoint of your guidance is implying an acceleration versus the growth that we saw in fiscal 2017. So could you just give us some color on the moving pieces in that outlook, and how should we think about the level of efficiency initiatives maybe offsetting the base expense growth? Thank you.
Kathleen Winters: Yes, thanks for the, Anj. Yes, if you look at midpoint, there’s a very slight increase in terms of how we’ve kind of managed and guided expenses in the past. Look, we’re really focused on balancing, both investment and expense growth. We’re very confident in our ability to execute on investments. We’ve got an excellent management team in place, a processes, as I’ve talked about previously are even more robust than they were in the past. So we’ve really got a really high-level of confidence in terms of being able to execute on what are quite frankly some really high-return projects. And we got a track record now of delivering on those high-return projects. You can see the results in Factors and ESG. You can see fixed income starting to payoff. So given the high-return projects we have, it just makes good economic sense to accelerate these investments.
Anjaneya Singh: Okay, understood. And then for a follow-up, could you just talk about what’s causing the onboarding or implementation periods to extend in Analytics? Is just happening with selected clients, given the larger tickets you referenced, or is it happening more broadly? Just trying to understand why it manifested so dramatically this quarter? Thanks.
Henry Fernandez: Hey, look, I – what I said before, which is the position of the product line from – here’s a tool and we’ll implement it to – here’s a solution and the services to achieve that to help you do a lot more inside the client organization. So that that’s going to take more time. And therefore, the recurring revenue of those recognized until we’re done with that phase – the implementation phase, which are one-time fees and those will be – there’ll be one-time charges that go – one-time revenues that go, but the recurring gets delayed and that’s a little bit of what’s happening with this delay in revenue recognition. But look, there’s nothing to worry about. We’re just telling you that’s why – that’s happening.
Anjaneya Singh: Understood. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Kayvon Rahbar: Hi. This is Kayvon filling in for Hamzah. You may have covered this already. But if you could maybe go back to, say, five years ago and maybe give us an understanding of any of the changes of the competitive dynamics in the indices business in terms of new entrants or fees those sort of things?
Henry Fernandez: Well, in index, it’s relatively stable, obviously, ESG five, seven years ago, it was a very, very different industry. So we’ve become a huge player in it during that time. And in analytics, I think that there has been a rationalization of the equity analytics providers and we come out on top in all that and a multi-asset class a little bit like that. In multi-asset class, there was – people only fixed income, not only in equity, I mean, not only multi-asset class, but was strength in fixed income only, or only in multi-asset class the strength in equity only. There’s conversion a little bit. In our case, with the entry into a lot of a fixed income and private-asset classes. So that’s what is happening. And obviously, larger players have come into the picture or is it black or is large player here and has been for a long time. Bloomberg have seen some kinds of offerings that they’re trying to work and factor as it comes into offering. So this will be a competitive landscape, but it’s a wide open field with a huge amount of used cases and users and each competitors are very unique differentiated sort of positioning that they’re trying to capitalize from. And we feel that even though competitive is not intense at this point.
Kayvon Rahbar: All righty. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum: Thanks, guys. Just one quick question, a lot of them have been asked already. But it sounds like you guys are trying to be a little bit cautious on the Analytical side based on some of the sales being more pushed to the back-end of the year. Are we going through a period just heightened investment as we go through this below market here, especially on the equity side? I guess, a little more and more commentary given just the overall environment that your customers are going through now, and what that may be contributing to their potentially to make investments in the technology now?
Henry Fernandez: Well, first of all, I mean, we want to be cautious, because we have been here before for three years, which would say, things are getting better and then next quarter things don’t, right? So and we’re telling you precisely the same things we’re going do both internally, because quarter doesn’t make a year to begin with for sure. So – but we are cautiously optimistic, because there are two, three things. I mean, literally, every asset manager pension fund in the world who have a system like and we offer in order to make them productive, scale out, understand risk and return and all of that. So that value proposition in general is very strong. What happens is that, it needs to be sort mixed into the process of what they have internally their legacy system, their culture, who is using what and all of that. So that gets into a melting part of things. So we’re trying to sort that out with a lot of our clients. And then lastly, I – we are very optimistic about that the repositioning of this. If you go sell a tool for risk and performance, people have to come up with additional budget to do this. If you go sell it, yes, it’s going to do risk and performance, but it’s going to help your streamline your operations, cut costs, communicate better, then it comes out of – they have funding. They will restructure. They will get rid of certain people. They will do certain things and I mean grew for us, so that’s the process. So we’re cautious, for sure, because we’ve been here and we don’t want to be telling you a thing that we will believe in. But we’re also be cautiously optimistic, because this thing is going our away.
Keith Housum: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stephen C. Davidson - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Sonya. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter 2017. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find reconciliation of the equivalent GAAP measure in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 25 to 30 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chief Executive Officer; Baer Petit, our new President; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good day to everyone. We reported another strong quarter, driven by the continued execution of our growth strategy, our focus on research driven innovation, and our continuing efforts to create innovative content that we can integrate across our applications and services. Now please turn to slide 4 for third quarter 2017 highlights. First, in terms of revenue growth, we returned to strong double-digit growth in revenue once again this quarter. We are particularly pleased with this very strong growth in asset-based fees, where we saw robust growth across all types of index-linked investment products, particularly with respect to revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI indices. We continue to believe that growth in the ETF market is still in the early innings and the year-to-date record cash net flows into ETFs linked to MSCI indices is a testament to the growth potential of this market for us. Year-to-date, through October 31, 2017, there has been record cash net flows of $114 billion into ETF linked to MSCI indices, already three times larger than the full year 2016 levels. Turning to operational efficiency, on the expense front, we continue to strive to make efficiency and productivity gains across the entire company in order to free up resources to enhance our products and services and applications and further improve profitability. I would like to briefly comment on the efficiency initiatives that were announced today. We have been keenly focused on efficiency and productivity efforts across the company, which have allowed us to optimize our capital deployment for shareholders. With our announcement today, we're stepping up our focus on capital deployment by re-positioning and re-prioritizing capital, particularly in the Analytics segment. Kathleen will provide you with additional detail in the call. Finally, in terms of capital optimization, there has been no change to our approach to returning capital to investors. Last quarter, our board of directors authorized a 36% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend, as you all know. We continue to be very opportunistic in repurchasing stock to ensure we're optimizing the deployment of capital for shareholders. This means, as we have said before, that we expect to repurchase more shares when there is softness and volatility in the market, and fewer shares when volatility is low. And we will continue to follow this approach for the time being. In summary, third quarter 2017 was another very strong quarter for us, characterized by strong revenue growth, continued gains in productivity and efficiency, continued strong investment in our firm, and a disciplined deployment of capital. Please turn to slide 5 now, where we highlight the power of the integrated franchise that MSCI brings to clients. Our franchise is very powerful because we offer products, services and research that help our clients address some of the most important and critical investment problems in the world. We would not be able to generate an additional $43 million in run rate related to Factor Indexes without Analytics, which is a key part of that integrated franchise. And we're also able to generate an additional $60 million in run rate related to ESG indices, because of the power of our index franchise and our ESG franchise and as a result of the combined power of these integrated franchise. This quarter, I will focus some of my remarks on our research and content development capabilities, and how they drive the creation of our differentiated content. Let us now turn to slide 6, where we highlight MSCI's strategy for meeting the needs of a changing market. And an important part of this strategy is the leverage of our content. We are witnesses – tremendous changes throughout the investment industry and these are creating enormous opportunities for us. We provide truly innovative, mission-critical content that is necessary for investment institutions to design and implement current and future investment strategies. For example, we are expanding our suite of indices. We are continuing our Factor innovation. We're looking to achieve broader and deeper ESG security coverage. And we're expanding our fixed income Analytics for fixed income portfolio managers. At the same time, all this differentiated content is delivered through client applications, third-party applications, and our own proprietary applications to help managers operate more effectively and efficiently. In terms of our proprietary applications, our goal is to create an integrated platform that combines all the technology, all the content and all the analytical assets of MSCI through a single interface and client experience. And we continue to make progress in the development and the creation of that integrated platform. In terms of providing services and solutions to clients, our goal is to provide those tools and those services to help clients use and recognize the full value of our content and our applications, and to help them become more effective and efficient in their investment processes. Please turn to slide 7, where we highlight the breadth and depth of our research and content development. Our research and content development group is spread across 23 cities and 16 countries, is responsible for creating our innovative content and therefore, they're very essential to our growth strategy. There are a total of 175 employees in research and content development, and 36 of them have PhDs in various sciences. In this past quarter, this group of research and development content colleagues held over 1,000 research meetings with clients and presented at 123 conferences around the world. On this slide, we highlight the areas where we help our client address issues relating to their equity portfolios, fixed income, and alternative portfolios and multi-asset class portfolios. We believe that this view of our offering, in addition to our segment reporting, provides valuable insights for shareholders into what clients find valuable about our offering. On slide 8, let me now bring our differentiated content to life for you through three case studies. With case study number one, one of the largest asset owners in the United States approached MSCI for a custom multi-factor index that reflected their specific investment strategy. In essence, they like our diversified multi-factor in index methodology, but they also wanted some customization to eliminate size as a factor and to adjust the weightings of various factors in order to better reflect their strategy. Over the course of one year, our team conducted many simulations and through discussions with the client designed a custom strategy index to support a $300 million allocation. With case study number two, a large global fixed income asset manager approached us to implement a fixed income portfolio construction, performance attribution, and risk management tool across multiple locations globally. We provided them with the software and the data to model their portfolios, construct portfolios using a fixed income factor model, and calculate performance and risk attribution using a consistent methodology. Lastly, with case study number three, a large global asset manager was already working extensively with MSCI on index and analytical tools, but not around ESG. The clients concluded that MSCI ESG ratings and data should be leveraged internally across asset classes to help the investment teams evaluate the ESG risks and opportunities of their portfolios. The ESG integration use case was the main driver for this sale. In addition, the client has also decided to launch ESG-specific products in 2017 using ESG indices. MSCI ESG content is now being rolled out to hundreds of analysts and portfolio managers within this client organization. The ESG ratings and data are delivered to this client through multiple channels, such as MSCI ESG Manager, our own application, Barra Portfolio Manager, another one of our own applications, and via a third-party application platform. These three case studies demonstrate the power of our research-driven approach to helping clients address their most pressing investment challenges. Now, you can see why we are so excited about the growth prospects of MSCI and why we are delivering such strong financial results. As we announced earlier this morning, we're very excited that Baer Pettit has been appointed President of MSCI and Laurent Seyer has been appointed our Chief Operating Officer. Each of these appointments became effective on October 31. As President, Baer will directly oversee the day-to-day management of all of our business functions, from client coverage and marketing to product management, research, technology, data and content operations and project management. Furthermore to better align our operating structure with our focus on client relationships and client experience, one of the key pillars of our long-term strategy, we have repositioned the role of Chief Operating Officer within our company from a products and operations approach to a client and go-to-market strategy approach. Accordingly, in addition to serving as Chief Client Officer, Laurent Seyer will become our new Chief Operating Officer reporting to Baer Pettit. These appointments are intended to acknowledge both Baer's and Laurent's many contributions to MSCI and to prepare MSCI for the growth opportunities that we see ahead and therefore our desire to broaden and deepen our senior management team to take advantage of all those great opportunities. Please join me in wishing them well in their new roles. With that, I would like to turn it over to Baer to say a few words to all of you.
C. D. Baer Pettit - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Henry, and good day to everyone on the phone. I'm pleased to join the call today as we communicate our strong third quarter financial results. This is a very exciting time for MSCI as we continue to execute our growth strategy and capitalize on the many opportunities that we have before us as a firm. Furthermore, I'm looking forward to speaking with our investors and analysts in the quarters ahead as we continue to communicate the compelling strategy and successes of MSCI.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Baer. I also would like to bring your attention to another announcement we made this morning. This past Tuesday, October 31, our board of directors appointed Marcus Smith to serve as a new Independent Director, effective today, November 2. Marcus has over 20 years of experience and leadership in fundamental equity investing and international portfolio management, and will be an invaluable asset to MSCI and our shareholders. We are thrilled to have somebody with Marcus this experience in the asset management industry join at this exciting time in our firm's growth. With that, I would like to pass the call to Kathleen. Kathleen?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Henry, and good day to everyone on the call. I'll start on slide 9 and take you through our performance for the quarter. Revenue growth of 11.7% was driven by strength across our segments. We had strong growth in asset-based fees and recurring subscription revenue. Operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 5% and 5.8%, respectively, as we continue to make investments and drive productivity. We're delivering substantial operating leverage, as you can see, with our operating income and our adjusted EBITDA growth, as well as diluted EPS and adjusted EPS growth of 36.8% and 29.9% respectively. Free cash flow generation in the quarter was $90 million, $45 million lower compared to the prior year, primarily driven by two items which were in line with our planning. These items were 1) higher payments for interest and 2) higher payments for taxes, as Q3 2016 benefited from tax refunds and lower quarterly tax payments. Fourth quarter is typically one of our strongest free cash flow quarters due to strong cash collections, and our free cash flow guidance remains at $310 million to $370 million, with the midpoint being above the prior year normalized free cash flow of approximately $330 million. So Q3 was a very strong quarter as we continue to execute our growth strategy. On slide 10, you can see the drivers of adjusted EPS growth. Adjusted EPS increased 30% in comparison to the third quarter 2016. The biggest driver of the increase was our strong top line growth, which was partially offset as we continue to fund investments. Additionally, the positive impact of lower share count with average diluted shares being down 4%, partially offset by higher interest expense, resulted in a net $0.03 benefit to EPS. The ongoing progress in aligning our tax profile with our operating footprint and the impact of other discrete items, combined with the positive impact of share-based compensation, excess tax benefits, benefited earnings by $0.05. This was partially offset by FX and others. Now let's turn to our segment results. Let's begin with the Index segment on slide 11 through 13. Index revenue grew 17% this quarter, the highest rate of growth since Q1 2013. Revenue growth was driven by a 30% increase in asset-based fees, which included strong growth in ETF-related revenue and also strength in non-ETF funds and exchange-traded futures and options products. Once again, ETFs linked to MSCI indexes were ranked number one for cash flows in equity ETFs globally, both quarter-to-date and year-to-date as of September 30, 2017. So we continue to be the market leader in equity ETF cash flow capture. Recurring subscription revenue grew at 9.5%, driven by growth in core benchmark data products as well as our newer products, including Factor and ESG indexes, as well as custom index products. Index recurring sales increased 32%, mainly driven by growth in core products and strong demand for new products, including Factor and ESG indexes. We are continuing our track record of growth with another quarter of strong, double-digit growth in Index subscription run rate, and retention remains high at 95.5%. In summary, this was another very strong performance for the Index product line, reflecting the benefit of the investments that we have made to enhance existing products and create new ones. Slide 12 presents detail on our asset-based fees. Starting with the upper-left chart, we recorded strong growth in asset-based fee revenue across all index-linked investment products. Revenue from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes was up 35%. There were a total of 983 ETFs benchmarked to MSCI indexes, an increase of 12% from the prior year or roughly 23% of the equity ETF market. Revenue from non-ETF asset products was up 15%, reflecting growth in AUM and an increased contribution from higher fee products. And revenue from exchange-traded futures and options increased 47%, driven by a strong increase in total trading volumes and a favorable product mix. Today, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index Future listed on ICE U.S. is the fourth largest equity index futures contract globally by open interest with 1.1 million contracts. Turning to the upper-right chart, we've captured 30% or $101 billion of year-to-date global equity ETF net flows. Since the end of the quarter and through October 31, 2017, ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes has increased to a record $701 billion, driven by $12 billion in net flows, and $15 billion in market appreciation. As shown in the lower left chart, quarter-end AUM by market exposure of ETFs linked to MSCI indexes reflected strong growth across all market segments. The developed markets ex-U.S. segment experienced particularly strong growth of $112 billion, 48% year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by net flows of $66 billion, which represented 37% of global net flows into this segment. Within this segment, MSCI EAFE index linked ETFs grew $53 billion or 52% versus Q3 2016. Lastly, on the lower right chart, you can see the average run rate basis point fee for the period at 3.05. Our strategy is to maximize revenue through differentiated licensing and optimize the price volume trade-off over the long-term. Accordingly, as lower average fee products continue to grow at a faster pace, you can expect to see the overall average fee decline while revenues continue to grow. Slide 13 illustrates the different ways we monetize our Index content, providing multiple sources of strong double-digit growth in Index run rate. This slide shows our Index content and use cases for the content. As you can see, growth in every category is double-digit. Looking at our growth through the content view, our fastest grower, Factor and ESG content, representing roughly 11% of total run rate, grew at 29%. Our research-driven Index content gives us many ways to drive strong growth and we're constantly looking for additional ways to monetize content. And we will continue to increase the integration of Index content with our other content and applications. On slide 14, we highlight the results for the Analytics segment. Analytics reported revenue growth of 3.3% or 3.7% when adjusted for the impact of FX. Revenue growth was driven by higher Equity and Multi-Asset Class Analytics products. Run rate growth, ex FX, was 5% in the quarter, as we had another quarter of favorable sales adding to our book of business. We're continuing to invest in our new Analytics platform and other discrete initiatives to drive revenue growth to higher levels. Slide 15 provides you with the key metrics for the Analytics product segment for the last five quarters. On the upper half of the slide, you have sales and cancels history. You can see that sales growth is trending up since Q1. Analytics recurring sales were up 15% in Q3 compared to the previous year, driven by growth in both Equity and Multi-Asset Class Analytics products. From a client segment perspective, the increase in sales was driven primarily by strength in the asset management client segment across our multi-asset class offering, including BarraOne and RiskManager, supported by our new Equity Analytics and fixed income capabilities. Cancels were lower by 29% compared to the prior year, primarily due to the elevated cancels we experienced in Q3 last year in our Multi-Asset Class Analytics product as well as our improved focus on maintaining high retention rates. With higher recurring sales and lower cancels, we had a 192% increase in net new recurring subscription sales. Aggregate retention rate continues to be strong at 93%, up 300 basis points compared to the prior year. As indicated on the lower half of the slide, we're seeing an improvement in Analytics performance. Both the growth of subscription run rate and subscription revenue growth rate has moved slightly higher this quarter, growing at 5% and 4%, respectively. We're cautiously optimistic that these trends will continue in the fourth quarter as we continue to see increasing sales, diminished impact of cancels and a continued focus on managing our costs, which we expect will translate into improved revenue and profitability over time. Performance in the Analytics segment continues to improve and key metrics, including sales, have increased this quarter. However, we're still in the middle of an ongoing repositioning of Analytics and the efficiency initiatives we announced today are designed to achieve greater levels of growth and profitability. These actions are giving us the flexibility to reprioritize and reposition a portion of the Analytics cost base towards higher return key initiatives like fixed income, our Analytics platform, and our managed services offering. We're doing this while maintaining overall cost discipline and delivering continued positive operating leverage. Turning to slide 16, we show results for the All Other segment. Revenue growth was up 16% year-over-year on a reported basis. First, in terms of ESG, revenue was again up more than 20%, driven by continued strong recurring sales, which were up by 18% year-over-year, principally driven by ESG ratings. A growing number of asset managers are integrating ESG into their processes and new sales are also being driven by existing clients who are broadening the use of ESG content to additional teams. We're very optimistic about the continued growth of this product line. And we will continue to invest in marketing and to build efficiencies by investing in technology infrastructure. Next, in terms of Real Estate, revenue was up 9% on a reported basis, and up approximately 8% on an FX adjusted basis. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by growth in our Market Information product. We continue to focus on restructuring the product offering and our cost structure to improve the performance of the product line. The continued strength in ESG revenue was the primary driver for the year-over-year increase in the adjusted EBITDA margin for All Other. Turning to slide 17, you have an update on our capital return activities. In Q3 2017 and through October 27, we repurchased and settled a total of 87,000 shares at an average price of approximately $104 for a total value of $9.1 million. There has been no change to our approach to capital return. As a reminder, in Q2 2017, we increased the dividend [by] 36%, in line with our target range of 30% to 40% of adjusted EPS. The lower pace of share repurchase activity was driven by lower levels of volatility in the market. We'll continue to approach share repurchases in line with past practice by repurchasing more shares when there's softness in the market and fewer shares when volatility is low. On slide 18, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. Reported cash on the balance sheet was $799 million at the end of the quarter. After deducting non-U.S. cash and our minimum cash balances for operating purposes in the U.S., the deployable cash is roughly $240 million. In terms of leverage, this quarter we are at 3.3 times, well within our stated range of 3 to 3.5 times as a result of growth in our adjusted EBITDA. Lastly on slide 19, we have our full year 2017 guidance. Adjusted EBITDA expenses are now expected to be at the higher end of the previously announced range of $605 million to $615 million. This refinement of our guidance is primarily reflecting higher severance in the fourth quarter associated with certain efficiency initiatives. The fourth quarter will include additional non-recurring severance of $5 million to $6 million above what was initially planned. We continually work to manage our cost base effectively, and these actions are part of this cost management. Part of the savings from these actions will be reinvested and a portion will generate productivity savings. The extent to which savings will be reinvested will be determined as we complete our 2018 planning cycle. This will be determined as we refine our assumptions about run rate growth, revenue growth, investment requirements and continued margin expansion. Our full year effective tax rate guidance remains at 30% to 31%, but given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the rest of the year, we're trending to the lower end of the previously stated range. We're maintaining the previously stated ranges for our full year net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow guidance. We expect 2017 free cash flow to be above the $330 million in normalized free cash flow reported for 2016, which was adjusted for approximately $60 million of discrete items. We're also affirming our long-term target. In summary, we continue to execute against our strategy and delivered another quarter of very strong financial performance. We're achieving productivity and efficiency gains and investing for growth. Our industry is transforming, and MSCI is uniquely positioned to assist our clients through the transformation and help them address their investment challenges and meet their evolving needs. We're very optimistic about our growth opportunities for the remainder of 2017 and beyond. Before I open the line for questions, I'd like to take a few moments to share another change with you. We're very sad to say that Steve Davidson will be leaving MSCI after three years. And so this will be Steve's last earnings call with us. I personally would like to thank Steve for all of his hard work and dedication to MSCI. He's made tremendous contributions in terms of helping us tell our story to the investment community in a clear and transparent manner. Steve, speaking on behalf of the MSCI team, I'd like to thank you for your leadership and many contributions. Taking over for Steve as Head of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Development will be Andy Wiechmann. Andy has been with MSCI since 2012, most recently as Head of FP&A and Business Development. I know Andy is eager to take on this new role and is looking forward to getting to know all of you. With that, we can open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Morning.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Very quickly on the – well, maybe not quickly, on the Analytics business. Obviously, we got the inflection point here positively that you had promised. And sounds like you're fairly optimistic that that will continue. So obviously, I see the numbers around retention and new sales, but can you give us a little bit more color in terms of where you're seeing success in terms of regions, customers, et cetera? And particularly, I think one of the themes this quarter has been kind of like sales cycles in Europe, given MiFID II, et cetera, coming in. So maybe you can share with us what you're seeing in that region, in particular. Thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, Alex, first of all, we're cautiously optimistic. We're not fairly optimistic. We've been there before. And as you know well, this is a product line that gets lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on the size of the ticket sales, right, which are much larger than in the rest of the company. And obviously, the size of – at times in our renewal rate. But as I said, we are cautiously optimistic. We are seeing strength in multi-asset class risk management among asset managers. We've done well in Europe, actually, as an example. We are also seeing strength, and logically so, in Equity Analytics. This is also part of the factor evolution. Equity Analytics is about factor investing. It's about understanding your own portfolio based on the (36:45) return and risk of factors in your portfolio. So we're seeing strength there across the different client segments. We also have seen a tapering of the cancellations and therefore higher renewal rates. A lot of this, and across the company, is really as a result of the global operating environment, right. We are a barometer of the investment patterns of investment institutions across the world. And as you see the global economy healing and gradually producing more growth, which is providing more earnings for companies, which is obviously propping up values in all asset classes. Our asset management clients and our asset owner clients are less prone to slash-and-burn expense control and that has benefit us also from that. We're also repositioning the Analytics product client, particularly the multi-asset class risk management and performance attribution, not only in terms of its functionality but also as a platform for asset managers of all types to create efficiencies and productivities and their investment processes, as opposed to them collecting data, building models, building technologies and the like, we are putting this proposition forward to them that a platform like MSCI can help them derive a lot of gains and efficiencies and cost management and produce significant outside benefits in portfolio construction, portfolio management and risk management.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: So, Alex, let me just add a couple of data points for you to that and thanks for the question. I mean, Henry's right, this can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but importantly, you can see the trend up in terms of the operating metrics that we look at since Q1 of this year. But regionally, we've seen some good strength, particularly in Europe. In fact, recurring sales in Europe were up quite substantially, 46% for the quarter over prior year Q3. And from a client perspective, we've seen some really nice strength in the asset management segment. On a year-to-date basis, with the improved sales and with cancels declining on a year-to-date basis, total net new asset management segment is up 132%.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for the color. Then, maybe just quickly, on the cost side, I heard the word investing a lot today. And I think you just clarified that it's more like shifting around than a lot of new investing. But when I think about your long-term cost guidance, I think it's been kind of like 5-ish percent is the long-term algorithm or part of the cost equation. Any reason why that should be changing because of all these investments you're talking about here? Maybe an early look into next year, that end?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: No. There's, Alex, no change at all in our approach to the business. We are investing significantly, but it's all being self-funded by significant amount of efficiency gains, productivity gains, reprioritizing, reallocating. We're being very, very dogmatic and disciplined about all of that and that allows us to talk more bullishly obviously about investments and also about continual margin expansion.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So in hearing you talk about the Analytics business and mentioning the word platform, it sounds like this is your competitive response to BlackRock's Aladdin product. And I wanted to just see what you thought of that and if I'm characterizing that correctly. And if so, they seem like a tough competitor, big, deep pockets and the large client. So I guess my question is how do you compete against them?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: More than anything. I mean, this is our response to the needs of our clients as opposed to any kind of view on competition. Our clients in this space are mostly active manager clients. Their business models are evolving. Their cost pressures are enormous, mostly for what we do on the other side, which is passive management, right. And therefore, we have stayed very close to them to see what kind of transformations they're going through and how do we help them on that transformation. Many of these asset management clients are multi-national, global institutions that have grown tremendously in the last 30, 40 years from basically small boutique broad based industry type of players to big global players. And through that period of time with relatively high margins, they were in-sourcing. They were doing a lot of things themselves and we see a huge trend of streamlining that, refocusing the product line, refocusing their customer areas and particularly refocusing their operations. And therefore, what we can offer them is not only the ability to do portfolio construction and performance attribution and risk management as core functions, but also do it in a way that they can create a lot of efficiencies in their investment processes. So we believe that there is plenty, plenty of opportunity there for us and anybody else because there are thousands of these kind of institutions around the world that are facing the same problem. So I don't see any of this as a zero-sum game with anybody.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. And so last question is on slide 17 on the buyback. Looking at the buyback, it's kind of like – what's going on there? I mean, you're at the level that's pretty close to where you were back in 2012 and 2013, barely above that. And so I guess my question is what will it take, since we're almost kind of coming to the end of the year, to see that become more active?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, the first thing, Bill, to sort of recognize is that, as Kathleen indicated, the net-net total amount of excess cash or therefore excess capital is $250 million, right, even though the total cash aggregate is almost $800 million, but a lot of that is outside of the U.S. and some of that is for operations outside of the U.S., some of that is for operations inside of the U.S. So with the $250 million or so, we have decided to be very selective and be very jealous of that. And therefore, we are going to deploy it when we see significant opportunities of volatility and softness in our stock. It's not a valuation issue. We believe our stock presents good value. And we're very, very bullish about the long-term prospects of the company. These are tactical issues associated with how much cash we have and therefore how we view the market. And as you know very well, volatility is at exceedingly low in the last couple quarters and it hasn't presented those opportunities, so we want to keep disciplined. And that's the best way that all of us, shareholders, including me, as the largest individual shareholder in the company, we want to deploy our capital.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yes. It's really consistent, Bill, with the way we've deployed the capital and have applied the strategy over the last several years. When you see more volatility, you'll see us be more active in the market.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. All right. Well, thank you very much.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Andrew Owen Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. This is actually Andrew Nicholas filling in for Chris. Just wondering if you could talk about Barclays POINT and Bloomberg's decision to sunset that about a year ago now, a little over a year ago. Just wondering how much you think that contributed to the strong sales quarter. And if so, is that something you would expect to benefit from over the next couple of quarters?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes. So what we've done over the last year and a half or so has been make meaningful investments in our fixed income Analytics at all levels, obviously from our traditional fixed income factor models, which we always been a leader in, to pricing models and prepayment models and all of that, and applied or incorporated all of that into our applications, particularly BarraOne in this case and have a significant amount of dialogue with our customers about that and offering that as an alternative to Barclays POINT. So there've been a few sales in that direction, but what we have benefited the most of is that – is because of that increased fixed income capability, we have gained more clients and more market share in the sort of whole spectrum of multi-asset class risk and performance. So, yes, we made that investment. A little bit of that has been paid back through fixed income portfolio managers in terms of POINT replacements, but very glad to see that that investment is paying off significantly in higher sales across the whole Analytics platform because of that fixed income capability. And therefore, that has emboldened us to continue with that investment plan, again, all self-funded, in order to see if we can continue to increase sales in the overall product line.
Andrew Owen Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, regarding EBITDA expense guidance and the one-time severance costs, can you talk about where that activity will be focused? And I apologize if I missed it, but can you quantify the annualized savings you expect to come from those changes? Thank you.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Sure, Andrew. So it's a broad program, but primarily in large part, it's related to Analytics. So there's going to be some incremental severance, about $5 million, $6 million incremental versus what we had originally planned or forecasted in Q4. And we'll be going forward with the plan in the coming weeks here and it will generate savings, still kind of finalizing things here, but I would say in the $13 million range. Some of that is going to be redeployed, reinvested. Some of it will generate productivity savings. We're still kind of working through some of the details and working through it as we go through our 2018 planning cycle, right, because importantly we want to understand what our top line looks like, what our run rate growth looks like, our revenue growth, the investment need, looking at margin expansion and talking all of that into consideration.
Andrew Owen Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Thank you. My first question is – so firstly, congratulations on all the management changes. Just out of curiosity, Henry, does this change your focus or priorities in terms of going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Not a lot. I mean, I'll continue to be the same chipper self that I am. I am as excited to come to work every day as I was 22 years ago when we created MSCI, so no change in that. Secondly, we have been operating like this for the last couple of years with a lot of the day-to-day managerial decisions being handled by Baer, Laurent and Kathleen. That has freed me up to spent about half of my time on the road visiting C level clients, which have helped us, and we'll see a lot more of the benefit of that in our go-to-market strategy, which is in addition to the subject-matter expert in our company talking to the users. We're going to the top of the house in our client, the C levels, CIO, CEO, CRO, et cetera, and present them with a holistic partnership with MSCI. So I'll be spending a lot of time with that. I will be spending even more time in our strategy and our competitive position. And lastly and very importantly, I think we want MSCI to be one of the unquestionable leaders in our industry in terms of technology and applications. So I've been spending a bit of my time at some of the big IT universities in America, some of which I went to, to try to understand how do we get them to leverage us in doing this. It's early days in all of that, but I continue to do a lot of the same things in the management of the firm and this is more of a division of labor in order to position the firm to capitalize on the incredible opportunities we have ahead of us. And this has always been a team effort at MSCI, even though you tend to hear from me quite often. But my partners in this company over the years have been incredibly – they've been the factors that have created this incredible performance in the company. So we want to continue doing that.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it, helpful. And then just broadly you talked about it before as cost pressures and the business model evolution with all of your clients, particularly your active managers. And on our side all that sounds like there's going to be a lot of shrinkage in the industry. And I guess my question is in terms of at least on the Analytics side, is the growth over a longer period of time more a question of share shifts as opposed to penetration? Just curious on your broader thought there.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Look, the investment industry as a whole is one of the most important industries of any society, right. The savings of society needs to be professionally invested. So the investment industry as a whole is growing and attracting among the best and the brightest in our global society. What happens is that there are parts of the investment industry that are growing by a lot, like passive management, wealth managers, sovereign wealth funds and the like. And there are parts of that industry that either on a cyclical or a secular basis have to rework their models, their business models. We at MSCI benefit from serving the entire spectrum of that industry and therefore benefiting from the ones that are growing by leaps and bounds, and giving them tools, and helping the ones that are not, deal with their cost pressures and the like, particularly in creating efficiencies and productivity gains through technology, data, modeling, and the like, and even creation of products like ESG products and Factor products and the like. So we look at the totality of this industry and we're only seeing incredible opportunities. A lot of people focused clearly the areas of the industry that are under stress, like obviously some active management, but that's not the whole investment industry. The investment industry is huge and global and we have that footprint, we have that brand, we have all the products, and all of that. And Analytics, it will be Analytics for wealth managers, Analytics for pension funds, Analytics for asset owners of all types, like sovereign wealth funds, and in addition to more Analytics for active asset managers that will need to retransform their operations. And we will be one of the key suppliers to them.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a lot for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Morning.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Hi.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Henry, this is a great quarter for new sales. And I was hoping – you mentioned the strength in the asset managers segment. Have you seen any shortening in the length of the sales cycle at all, any changes in the pipeline? What do you think was the real sort of catalyst for the success this quarter? And is there any reason to think that there was any pull forward from the fourth quarter?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Analytics, and our global pipeline remains robust. And again, it's a reflection of our go-to-market strategy, top-down, bottom-up. It's a reflection of the significant investment that we're making in innovation and new products and new service models, new pricing models, and all of that. And it's also as a result of the global operating environment that it is – as I said at the beginning, is gradually getting better, at least as it relates to cost management, right. So we continue cautiously optimistic. Obviously, people talk about whether certain asset classes are trophy or not. But we believe that this recovery that we're seeing from the nine-year financial crisis is taking hold around the world and a lot of people are looking to do things and the like. So we feel very good about that and our pipeline reflects that. Now there could geopolitical events or market corrections or things like that, that'll slow it down. So we're seeing a little bit of a shortening of the sale cycle. Obviously, bigger pipeline, all of that is boding – is going to bode well for us, but again, it's all gradual and it's all lagging a little bit, right. Obviously, part of our business is leading such as the ABF. And part of our business lags the recovery in the global markets like the subscription business.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. And you mentioned a number of, obviously, leadership appointments, changes this morning. And so what are sort of the initial things that you're hoping to accomplish, I guess, or accelerate maybe, just over the next year or so?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, first of all, as I said before, we have been operating like this for two years already or so. So from that point of view, the incremental sort of change is marginal, because when we appointed Baer to be Chief Operating Officer and Laurent Seyer to be Chief Client Officer, they had a very strong partnership. And when Kathleen came onboard, I began to delegate a lot of the day-to-day decisions to them. And I will spend a great deal of time with them every month or every quarter going through every part of the company. So that is already happening. So what I'd like to do is to continue to what I said before, which is we have enormous opportunity. And we need to take advantage of them and reposition the company, reimagine the company for continue growth and profitability. I go around MSCI telling people that we're still on the ground floor of what is possible to achieve with this firm. I'm saying it to all of you now, because I truly believe it. And the investment industry, in all these changes and all these dynamics of what is going on today and the recovery to a more normalized global economic environment and global financial environment only bodes well for us to capitalize on those opportunities. And I need to spend more time shaping that.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Kayvan Rahbar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. This is Kayvan filling in for Hamzah. Can you walk us through your exposure to Asia in terms of revenue? I think in 2013, there was an add of sales people in that region. So we're just kind of curious how that region has scaled up and what the opportunity there is long-term, given the increasing sophistication of the asset managers out there?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes. So Kathleen will give you some of the numbers in a minute while we look them up. But I am extremely bullish on the Asia Pacific region. I've been going to that region for, I don't know, 38 years now, since 1979. I visit that region quite often. Actually, this past summer I was there four times in all the major countries in the region. It's a region that is very asset owner rich in term of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. And we are extremely well-positioned with many of them, not only in terms of Factor investing, which we've done quite a lot with them on their assets under management fees, asset-based fees, but also ESG. We announced what we were doing with the GPIF in Japan with respect to indices that we created for them that they're deploying a significant amount of capital. Clearly, the global asset managers, we always cover them in the region. And we're increasingly covering well the regional managers, the ones from Japan and Korea and other places. And one area, clearly, that we're very focused on is the development of China. China has been a good but a small market for us because it's been closed. Not a lot of money from outside of the country goes into the country, and not a lot of money goes out. But that is beginning to change. And we believe that that could present a significant opportunity for us, because that's where we – it's the cross-border flows that we make the most benefit, benefits us the most. Lastly, we're also focused on the development of the exchange-traded options and futures industry in Asia. You're going to see some announcements on our part and our exchange partners in the next few months about new index futures and options that we'll be launching in the region. So hopefully, that will add to that increasing franchise of derivatives, index derivatives that we're trying to develop around the world.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Let me just add a data point in terms of the kind of growth we've been seeing there. Typically, whether you're looking at run rate or revenue growth, we've been seeing kind of high-ish single-digit growth in the region.
Kayvan Rahbar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. I wanted to get your thoughts on the indexing flow maybe as we go into next year. Can it get better from here? And sort of what's the factors that add to the growth? Is it Factor Indexing? Or is it special products that'll drive further growth from here? And maybe if you could just give us an update on what factor investing contributed this quarter?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: It's across the board. Clearly, the market beta, which is the largest part of what we do, has experienced quite significant growth from a large base, obviously. In that slide that we gave you, which is what page? Page 13, this is probably one of the best slides here in this presentation, right. It really gives you a good indication of our Index context across active, passive, derivatives and across the various categories of Factor and ESG, which is obviously a different weighing of market caps, developed markets, emerging markets, and the customized and specialized indices. So we're seeing growth in totally across the board. Obviously, some areas have higher growth because they are from a lower base. Factors has experienced significant growth. ESG from a small base growing in the 40s or 50%. I'm talking about ESG indices. Actually, when you combine our ESG footprint between what we do in the segment and the other segment, and what we do in indices, it's now about $75 million run rate and growing at a very nice pace. So that gives you an indication of the growth there. So it's really across the board and so far it continues. I'm sure at some point, there may be some market correction and the like, but in market corrections what we have seen is that people have a flight to indices as well, even though obviously the market goes down, the flows continue. But we will see what happens in the next cycle here.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. And then just on the margins. Maybe you can give us some early preview on what you're thinking for 2018? I figured I'd try. And I know it's early, but can you single out some areas of investment versus cutbacks heading into 2018 versus this year? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: We're still in the operating plan process, and then we still need to conclude that and present it to our board, so we don't have anything. We'll probably be giving you some indications on that in the next quarter. In terms of the investment plan, it's really a continuation of what we've been doing. In the indices, it's about Factor, it's about ESG indices, it's about – on that front, it's about wealth management on the client part. It's about futures and options, which we see a lot of potential there. On the Analytics side, it's about the platform, this Analytics platform, our application platform, what we've been talking about. It's about fixed income. It's about providing services or solutions in addition to products and tools. On ESG, it's about everything, right? The key with ESG is how do you scale up the business because if we like it at $75 million, we're going to like it a lot more at $200 million run rate, right. So we're trying hard to keep up with the pace of that. And fortunately, for us, we've been able to achieve both, high growth in revenues and good amount of profitability, even as we scale up that business. So that's – we will continue to invest there. And in Real Estate, we think we are getting close to the turnaround, this sort of uptick of that. Maybe next year, we'll give you more of that. But at the end, if you look at the three segments, hopefully, someday in the future, we can have all three segments hitting us at all cylinders and provide the growth and profitability that we've been aspiring toward.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. On a margin basis, look, we're still committed to and sticking with the long-term margin target ranges that we've talked about previously. We're clearly kind of smacked out in the middle of the 2018 planning cycle right now. So there's still a lot of work to do to get through that planning. But, look, our very good challenge that we have is how to fund all of the really good investment projects that we have. So we're committed to being really disciplined in terms of how we're allocating capital, how we're prioritizing our investments and being smart about containing costs. So we're working through the extent to which we've got top line growth, how the run rate is growing, continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. We're very committed to that. And then, the areas where we want to invest and how we prioritize that. So we'll definitely be sharing more with you after we get through the planning cycle.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anj Singh of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Another question on margins as it relates to your Index margin, which were again above your targeted range. I realize you're having really good growth in asset-based fees. But should we be at all thinking that perhaps some lower investment spend is driving some of this, contrary to what you've been talking about on the call? I guess what I'm trying to get at is you'll probably see good growth in your asset-based products for quite some time, so are we in a period where Index margins could remain sustainably elevated somewhat? Or are you going to ramp up some of those investments that could still bring it down to your targeted range, despite the good growth in asset-based fees?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, I think the algorithm of the optimization program that we have is how do we balance out what we believe to be sustainable revenues from both the subscription part and the asset-based fees, and therefore, how much of that we let it drop to the margin and how much of that we put into investments. Clearly, markets have run up a lot at the moment and therefore, we have let that incremental revenue just drop down to the margin. To the extent that a few quarters go by and we feel that that's continue to be sustainable, we may step up some investments that we have, but we want to stay within the 68% to 72%. At the higher end of that is to allow or through that plan is to allow for that flexibility in the event of significant spurts in asset values and asset-based fees. And the lower end of that is to allow for the declines in equity markets and not get totally obsessed about redoing the cost structure of the product line. So that's what we're trying to achieve. There is no question that this product line can continue to grow and grow even faster, if we continue or even put more investment in it. This is exploding all over the world, right. So we're trying to follow a very balanced approach to profitability and shareholder returns on one hand and investment into products and clients on the other hand.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then another question on the improvement in Analytics' run rates in light of some of the repositioning and efficiency efforts in your commentary earlier. Any thoughts on how these efforts may manifest themselves in your results as we look ahead? Should we be expecting the top line to continue this sort of accelerating trajectory, as well as the profitability increasing, realizing things are lumpy quarter-to-quarter? Any commentary you could give on what a longer-term trend could look like would be helpful. Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So our financial strategy on this product line has been what do we do to get to high 20s EBITDA margin with the revenue growth that we have been experiencing in the last couple of years. But we'll say we want to grow faster at the top line and therefore, it's not going to happen without innovation, services and products and client distribution, and all of that, applications, et cetera. So what we feel is that we've got to – again, it's another optimization, we feel that we need to put effort into that and therefore, we have taken the margin all the way to the high 20s, close to 30%, but are not immediately looking to go beyond that until we see an acceleration of revenue growth. And our longer-term target is 30% to 35% EBITDA margin, but that needs to be predicated on higher revenue growth. So the way we're doing that is not taking it from the shareholders and from the margin, the way we're doing that is being extremely anal and dogmatic and disciplined about reprioritizing the cost structure and taking it from a lot of areas that may not yield a lot of results and refocusing that money into areas that will give us higher growth. So, too early to tell how much of the savings, probably the majority of the savings will be directed for things that can help us accelerate revenue growth as opposed to dropping it to the margin. We always like balance, so there may be a little bit of that that drops to the margin. But again, what we want in this product line is to grow in the high single-digits in revenues and get to 30% to 35% EBITDA margins. And how you get there is this method that I just described to you.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity. Henry, you gave some case studies on slide 8 that I thought were beneficial, but is it possible to provide a bit of quantification in terms of what type of revenue will this generate for MSCI? And is it non-recurring versus recurring? And perhaps like what buckets would it fill it in? And I know you probably can't get into a lot of detail there, but if you can give us a little bit of perspective to understand a little more about the opportunity with the content development here?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Pretty much everything we talk about is recurring revenue. So we like non-recurring revenue. We like it from all sources, but what we clearly focus in these examples has always been recurring revenue as opposed to kind of one-time. Secondly, it's that the first example drops to the Index product line, particularly in an asset-based fee structure. The last example in fixed income is fairly meaningful run rate, annual run rate in subscription to our Analytics product line. So that's another one. And I think the middle example may go into the ESG product line, if I remember correctly. Is that -
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: The third one is ESG.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: No. The second example is the fixed income. Yes. And the last one will go into the ESG recurring product line, which is obviously growing 20%-plus a year.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Got you. Is it possible to say like how largely or how much of a contributor they are to the top line?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: These are examples. Once we aggregate all these examples, that's what gives you the run rate growth that we're giving you. We don't want to get too close to an individual client, and an individual run rate or an individual thing, but combined this is potentially a few million dollars of run rate, right.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Helpful. Thank you. I guess I'll squeak one more in here. With the repositioning of your investments in the Analytics business, is there going to be a de-emphasis on some products that you would perhaps let them lapse because of the margins or how are you guys think about your investment there?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes. Look, that's a good question, because what happens to Analytics is, we all think of – in the Analytics product line that, first of all, it's a little bit of a misnomer when we call it Analytics, but that's the best name we come up with. But secondly, it's a very diversified product line with a lot of different types of products and services and a lot of different customer bases, from a pension fund to a hedge fund, to a wealth manager and a bank, and it's very diversified in terms of it. The areas that are growing are the core big areas, such as risk management, which is the bigger part, the multi-asset class risk management, the Equity Analytics and all of that, and we're benefiting from that and therefore putting more efforts into that. The areas that are dragging are those areas that we haven't – the small product lines that we haven't emphasized as much, like energy and commodity analytics would be one example of that. Credit manager is another example of that, which is an older product and things like that. And unfortunately we have a little bit of – a huge amount of good buying type of thing in the run rate and a small amount of areas that we're just harvesting and those have either no growth or negative growth and they tend to impact the core areas, but it's what we have and maybe in the future we'll break it out in order for you to get a sense of that. But the vast majority, which is the area – the core areas are growing obviously faster than the 5% because there's a small number of areas, but they do have an impact on the run rates that we were seeing canceled because we are not paying any attention, we're not investing in that and the like. And they'll eventually run to zero, but while they don't, it impacts the numbers.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Stephen Davidson for any further remarks.
Stephen C. Davidson - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, everyone, for your time today and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating on today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stephen C. Davidson - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Charlotte. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter 2017. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measure in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 24 to 29 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good day to everyone on the phone. We reported another strong quarter driven by the continued execution of our growth strategy, our focus on innovation, and our continuing efforts to drive a higher level of integration of our content, analytical applications, and services. We believe that this integration will help our clients make better investment decisions and create long-term value for our shareholders. Please turn to slide 4, for second quarter 2017 highlights. First, in terms of revenue growth, we delivered a strong upper single-digit growth in revenue, once again, this quarter. Our growth is being driven by a combination of solid growth in our core products and a strong growth in newer areas in which we have been investing like Factors and ESG. Increasingly, our ability to generate a strong revenue growth has been aided by the integration of our content, our analytical software applications, and our services. We are particularly pleased with the very strong growth in asset-based fees, where we saw strong growth across all products, particularly revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, both in the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to believe that growth in the ETF market is in the early innings. And the record cash inflows into MSCI-linked ETFs year-to-date is a testament to the growth potential of this market for us. Year-to-date and through August 1, 2017, cash inflows of $92 billion are already over 2 times full year 2016 levels and higher than full year 2015 inflows. Lastly, I would also like to highlight that our long-term goal of achieving upper single-digit revenue growth for analytics has not changed. The lower growth this quarter was driven by several factors which Kathleen will cover later. We expect the performance of this product line to improve in the second half of 2017. Turning to operational efficiency. On the expense front, we continue to strive for higher levels of efficiency, continue reprioritization of projects and initiatives and gains in productivity, to free up resources, to invest more in innovation, and to further improve our levels of profitability. Our new lower fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate guidance reflects an acceleration of the benefits from the closer alignment of our tax profile with our global operating footprint, and Kathleen will provide you with more details on this area. Finally, in terms of capital optimization, there has been no change to our approach to returning capital to investors. We are particularly pleased that our board of directors has approved a sizable increase in our dividend to $0.38 per share this quarter. As discussed before, we continue to be very opportunistic in our repurchasing process of our shares to ensure we're optimizing the deployment of our capital to our shareholders. As discussed before, again, this means that we expect to repurchase more shares when there's softness in the market as we did in the fourth quarter and less shares when volatility is low. But the approach continues to be the same quarter-to-quarter throughout the year. In summary, second quarter 2017 was another very good quarter for us characterized by strong revenue growth, gains in productivity and efficiency, continued investment for innovation, and an ongoing and disciplined deployment of capital. On slide 5, we highlight the key drivers of revenue growth and profitability in this quarter. Our Index franchise continued to grow with a total of 973 ETFs benchmark to MSCI indexes or roughly 23% of the equity ETF market. Of the 973 ETFs, 204 are based on Factors and 71 are related to ESG which highlights the benefits of our innovation and market leadership in these areas. The quarterly average AUM in non-ETF passive products linked to our indexes grew 17% compared to the prior year, and revenue growth is also benefiting from increased contribution from higher fee products including factor indexes. In market cap indexes, we have launched two new data products and continue to enhance our existing flagship products. In terms of equity factor indexes and equity risk models, we had 61 asset owner benchmark wins in Q2 led by high dividend yield and minimum volatility allocations particularly from Japan. ESG ratings and ESG indexes were also strong this quarter with ratings benefiting from the enhancement of our offering. And we've had four benchmark wins in ESG indexes for the quarter. We are increasingly seeing strong demand for a combination of ESG and factor indexes. We are working on new products to meet this demand, and we feel we're extremely well positioned in this area. For example, one of the world's largest pension funds recently selected our MSCI Japan Empowering Woman Index and the MSCI Japan ESG Select Leaders Index as benchmarks for their ESG investment strategy. The Empowering Woman Index is constructed on the basis of a quality factor and obviously factors attributed to those companies that are attracting, developing and promoting woman. In derivatives, we are very pleased that contracts linked to our Emerging Market (sic) [Markets] Index on ICE U.S. grossed $1 million in open interest for a notional value of $50 billion. This futures contract is now the fourth largest in the world in terms of open interest. In terms of productivity and efficiency, as a result of our ongoing focus on efficiency, we're seeing improvement in our technology platform. For example, we're able to generate indexes and risk models much more rapidly and efficiently today because of our investments in our content manufacturing plant, so to speak. We are continually prioritizing and executing on our key initiatives and investments to be sure they are meeting our capital return thresholds. The key scorecard metrics for initiatives on investment are on track and in line with our expectations. Please turn to slide 6 where we highlight again for you the integrated franchise that MSCI is bringing to clients. My goal is to update you each quarter on how we are doing with our integration by providing concrete examples of how the integration of our content, analytical applications and services help our clients make better investment decisions and more efficiently. Please turn to slide 7 where we highlight in particular the integration of our index factor, real estate, and ESG content. The integration of this content represents currently approximately $56 million in run rate and has grown at a rate of roughly 49% compared to the prior year. What is compelling about this integration is that the strong growth potential of each individual part of our product line on a stand-alone basis is getting magnified when brought together and integrated. So, we are aiming to achieve both high levels of growth of the individual product lines on a stand-alone basis and magnifying it with incremental growth by integrating the content and the product lines together. The potential underlying value of this integrated content, therefore, is well in excess of the sum of the parts. By integrating Index, ESG, Factor Content, we are providing clients with a holistic view of the equity market opportunity that cuts across Market Cap Factor and ESG exposures, and it cuts across whether it's Index as a benchmark to a portfolio or replication of a portfolio, or whether it is the risk factors that are driving performance and risk in those portfolios. We're also integrating Real Estate and ESG Content with our new analytics platform. By including Real Estate risk models in our multi-asset-class analytics, we're able to provide clients with a comprehensive view of risk which includes a very large and fast-growing real estate asset class around the world. With the integration of ESG in analytics, we're providing clients with the opportunity to interact with ESG Content on a broader level by enabling performance attribution, risk attribution, or even using ESG's screens or fields in their portfolios. Next, by using our latest global equity model to construct Factor Indexes with our applications, we are integrating our Factor Indexes and risk models so that our clients are speaking the same factor language. We're also integrating ESG and establishing direct pipeline for integration across all of our applications. To simplify all of that internally, what we're doing is taking MSCI's equity data opportunity set and combining all of that with our best-in-class factor risk models and portfolio construction tools and analytics in order to create a significant economies in terms of all the inputs that are required for all of these products. Because of this integration, we're able to go to our clients with new and innovative products and services that could not have been done before this integration. For example, a large asset owner in the U.S. is now able to create and maintain factor based portfolios and launch investment products on them, because they have the tools now and the ability to put them together as opposed to what they had before. This client is leveraging our integrated data, our research expertise, our risk models, our applications, our ability to create indices in order to create, manage, monitor and generate not only portfolios, but also performance attribution reports. It's important to note that this business model is not bespoke. It is highly scalable and repeatable, and that's exactly what we're trying to achieve. In summary, this is a great example of how we're leveraging a lot of our content and our applications together in order to create another layer of growth on top of the one that exists with the individual product lines. Going to slide 8, we illustrate the ways our content applications and services provide tools to help our clients make better investment decisions. And by helping them, we're creating long-term value for our shareholders. Overall, asset owners can use our products and services to help them identify those managers that generate alpha, and those managers that can stay very close to the beta and generate efficiencies and low cost. For our active clients, integrating index factor, real estate and ESG content allows them to add value as an active manager. In other works, they're able to provide their own clients with deeper insights into the alpha they're generating. Conversely, for passive managers, we're able to provide them with more product options for their asset owner clients or individual investor clients. And these solutions are very cost efficient tools to capture factor-based premium. Instead of going through each one of these bullet points in this slide, I would like to highlight five client deals from this past quarter which illustrate the power of integrating our content, applications, and services. First, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in Asia who is already a client of index, real estate, ESG, and hedge platform recently selected MSCI for equity risk analytics. This client is increasingly focused on factor investing. So, we are actively speaking with them about these top factors and research for them to create exposures on portfolios in this category. Next, a very large Canadian asset owner with a large global real estate portfolio selected MSCI for our real estate portfolio analysis service, just like a performance attribution service, with a global custom benchmark. Next, we established a new ETF partnership with a leading U.S. manager to launch two new ETFs based on MSCI's U.S. Equity Indexes. And therefore, significantly building strength in our U.S.A. MSCI franchise and brand. This client is very eager to leverage MSCI's leadership in index analytics and our deep relationship with asset owners around the world. Next, we signed two significant ESG deals in the quarter. First, one of the largest mutual fund managers in the U.S. recently launched several U.S. and international ESG index funds based on MSCI indices. And a very large wealth manager in the U.S. agreed to embed MSCI ESG content on their platform for over 2 million self-directed investment clients with our brand prominently featured on the platform. Each of these examples are concrete evidence of how the integration of our content applications and services are helping our clients, and we believe this increasing integration will aid in our ability to generate a strong revenue growth over and above the sum of the growth in our individual product line. Before I hand over the call to Kathleen, I would like to say a few words regarding our historic recent market classification announcement on the inclusion of China A-shares in the emerging market index and our active (19:19) family of indexes. I would like to thank all of our clients who were instrumental in providing significant insights during the consultation leading up to this decision, which was made possible by the significant improvements in market accessibility as a result of the efforts of the Chinese regulators and stock exchanges with whom we have been working closely together for the better part of four or five years. The quality of this overall process is a testament to the unique position that MSCI holds in the investment process. Our research-driven focus, our independence, and the relentless efforts of our employees to do what is best for our clients. I would like now to pass the call over to Kathleen.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Henry, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll start on slide 9. As you can see, we delivered another quarter of strong performance in Q2. Revenue growth of 9% was driven by strong asset-based fees and recurring subscription revenue. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, revenues increased 9.4%, excluding the impact on asset-based fees. Operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 3% and 4% respectively. We continue to focus on strong cross-management and productivity balanced with continued investments. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, both operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses, increased 5%. We are delivering substantial operating leverage with operating income and adjusted EBITDA growth of 16% and 14% and diluted EPS and adjusted EPS growth of 29% and 23% respectively. Free cash flow generation in the quarter was $10 million higher compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher cash collections and lower income tax payments due to timing, partially offset by higher cash operating expenses. This was another very strong quarter as we continue to execute our growth strategy. On slide 10, you can see the drivers of adjusted EPS growth in Q2. Adjusted EPS increased $0.18 or 23% to $0.95 per share in comparison to prior year. The main driver of our EPS growth continues to be our strong top line increase, coupled with productivity net of investments. The ongoing progress in aligning our tax profile with our operating footprint, combined with the positive impact of share-based compensation, excess tax benefits, resulted in a lower effective tax rate of 30.8% in the quarter which benefited earnings by $0.03. Lastly, FX and Other had a $0.02 positive impact on EPS. Now, let's turn to our segment results. I'll begin with the Index segment on slides 11 through 13. Index revenue grew at 16.5% this quarter, the highest rate of growth since Q1 2013. The revenue growth was driven by a 35% increase in asset-based fees which included strong growth in ETF-related revenue and also strength in non-ETF and exchange traded futures and options. Once again, ETFs linked to MSCI indexes were ranked number one for cash flows in equity ETFs globally, both quarter-to-date and year-to-date as of June 30. Recurring subscription revenue grew at 9%, driven by growth in core benchmark data products, as well as our newer products, including factor, thematic and custom index products, and usage fees. Index recurring sales increased 4% in the quarter, mainly driven by strong demand for custom indexes, factor and ESG modules, as well as higher usage fees. We're continuing our track record of growth with another quarter of strong index subscription run rate growth. We continue to invest in and grow our index franchise and it continues to deliver significant value. Turning to slide 12. You have detail on our asset-based fees. Starting with the upper left chart, we've recorded strong growth in asset-based fee revenue across all products. Revenue from ETF linked to MSCI indexes was up 32%. Revenue from non-ETF asset products was up 41%, reflecting growth in AUM and growth in higher fee products including Factor Indexes and revenue from exchange-traded futures and options increased 54%, driven by substantial increases in volumes. Turning to the upper right chart. We've captured 46% or $45 billion and 34% or $83 billion of Q2 and year-to-date global equity ETF inflows respectively. Since the end of the quarter and through August 1, ETF, AUM linked to MSCI indexes has increased to a record $657 billion, driven by $9 billion in inflows and $24 billion in market appreciation. MSCI was ranked number one for the AUM linked to the new ETFs license year-to-date. As shown in the lower left chart, quarter-end AUM by market exposure of ETFs linked to MSCI indexes reflected strong growth across all market segments. The developed markets ex-U.S. segment experienced particularly strong growth of $96 billion or 42% year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by inflows of $52 billion, which represented 37% of global cash inflows into this segment. Within this segment, MSCI EAFE index-linked ETFs grew $42 billion since Q2 2016. Lastly, as shown in the lower right chart, we've seen a stabilization of the average basis point fee at 3.07 in Q2. Slide 13 illustrates how our differentiated licensing strategy has successfully optimized run rate for our ETF-related product line. As we know, there's been a significant influx of funds to the ETF space over the last several years. With this macro trend and our continuous innovation in introduction of our various ETF indexes over this time, we've seen a 23% CAGR in ETF, AUM linked to our indexes. We've also seen, however, faster growth over the past few years in lower fee ETF linked to our indexes, which has mainly led to the decline in the average basis point fee from 3.63 in Q2 2013 to 3.07 in Q2 2017. The result is that the fast growth in AUM linked to MSCI indexes has more than offset the decline in the average basis point fee, such that our run rate has grown at a CAGR of 18% since Q2 2013. This data clearly reflects the strong price volume trade-off from which we are bouncing. (27:19) On slide 14, we highlight the results to the Analytics segment. Analytics reported revenue growth of 1% or 2% when adjusted for the impact of FX. Analytics run rate growth ex-FX was 3.7% in the quarter. The lower level of reported revenue growth this quarter was primarily driven by two factors. First, the impact of elevated cancels in the prior year; second, the timing of client implementations for new sales, which are included in run rate at the time of sale although not recognized into revenue until implementation milestones are completed at a later date. Analytics-adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% in the quarter, down from 30% in the prior year but up from 26% in Q1 2017. This margin rate is in line with our previously disclosed planning for the year. Slide 15 provides you with the sales and cancels for the Analytics products segment. Recurring sales were up 8% year-over-year. Cancels decreased 23%, which resulted in a 140% or $3 million increase in recurring net new. This is a substantial uptick from prior quarters. The increase in sales was driven primarily by strength in the asset manager and asset owner client segments across our multi-asset class offerings, including risk manager and BarraOne, as well as equity analytics. Despite weakness in select client segments over the last several quarters, our pipeline is very strong, and we're seeing good execution in closing deals so far in Q3. Given the diminished impact of cancels and the timing of implementations, as well as our continued cost focus, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for Analytics' performance in the second half of the year. Turning to slide 16 now, we show the results for the All Other segment. Revenue growth is down 2% year-over-year on a reported basis, but up 1% excluding the impact of FX and the sale of the Real Estate occupiers business. First, in terms of ESG, revenue was up 25% driven by continued strong recurring sales which were up 61% year-over-year principally driven by ESG Ratings. ESG total net new was a record $3.4 million. We continue to see increasing integration of ESG into the mainstream of the investment process, and we continue to focus on investment in new products and marketing. We're very optimistic about the continued growth of this product line. Next, in terms of Real Estate, revenue was down 21% on a reported basis and down approximately 16% on an FX-adjusted basis excluding the occupiers business. The decline in the revenue was primarily driven by higher cancels principally from a discontinued index, the timing of report delivery, and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We continue to focus on restructuring the product offering to improve performance of the product line. The softness in Real Estate revenue was the primary driver for the year-over-year decline in the adjusted EBITDA margin. Turning to slide 17, you have an update on our capital return activity. In Q2 2017 and through July 28, we purchased and settled a total of 0.5 million shares at an average price of $100.63 for a total value of $46.4 million. There's been no change to our approach to capital return. The lower pace of share repurchase activity was driven by lower levels of volatility in the market. The board approved a 35.7% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.38 per share which equates to $1.52 on an annualized basis. On slide 18, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. While reported cash on the balance sheet was $750.6 million at the end of the quarter, after deducting non-U.S. cash and our minimum cash balances for operating purposes in the U.S., deployable cash is roughly $250 million. The increase in non-U.S. cash since year end primarily reflects our progress in aligning our tax profile with our global operating footprint. As part of this realignment, foreign cash has grown reflecting growth in invoicing and earnings outside the U.S., and the impact of one-time transitional intercompany payments. We expect the increase in the foreign cash balance to be generally consistent with the growth in foreign earnings of our foreign operations after the transition period is concluded. Lastly, on slide 19, we have our full-year 2017 guidance. Based on the progression of our investments and the efficiencies that we've achieved year-to-date, we're tightening the range for full-year 2017 total operating expenses which are now expected to be in the range of $690 million to $700 million and adjusted EBITDA expenses which are now expected to be in the range of $605 million to $615 million. We expect our full-year effective tax rate to be between 30% and 31% down from the previous range of 31.5% to 32.5%. The change in our effective tax rate guidance is being driven by the acceleration of benefits from aligning our tax profile to our global operating footprint as well as higher benefits from share-based compensation. We're also reaffirming our long-term target. In summary, we continue to execute against our strategy and the MSCI algorithm in the quarter, delivering strong upper single-digit growth in revenue, and we're investing for growth and creating a more efficient infrastructure while at the same time achieving productivity and efficiency gains. We're well-positioned given macro trends and we are optimistic about our prospects for continued growth for the remainder of 2017 and beyond. With that, we'll open the line to take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Just lots of detail here. So, I think not much left. But just coming to the Analytics also for the second half, I think Henry mentioned that and you just mentioned again. But like, when I look at my model and I look at where the run rate is, of course, there should be an acceleration in the second half because the comps are getting much easier and we know where we're already running. But trying to understand if there's something else you're trying to communicate here. Is the business on itself getting better? Are you seeing more sales, is there better reception or is it just where the run rate is? So, maybe flesh it out a little bit more.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, let's step back a minute and just talk about the overall environment that we're seeing. Look, it's a very fragmented market, and we've got lots of different client segments. And as we've talked about in the past, some of those segments are healthier, and some have been more challenged over the last several quarters. So, what we're seeing now is that, I would say, a slightly strengthening environment in that we're seeing a higher retention rate. Retention at 93.9%, up over the last several quarters. And we're seeing favorable sales, up 8%, and cancels more favorable as well. So, we are seeing strength in some client segments, particularly asset manager, asset owner client segments across our RiskManager offering, BarraOne, equity analytics. In fact, net new sales to asset managers were up 33% year-over-year. We do still see some weakness in some segments, particularly hedge funds and particularly outside the U.S. So, the way I would characterize it is that, look, we're cautiously optimistic here. We've seen – we've got a healthy pipeline. We're looking at how we're progressing in Q3 in terms of execution and closing deals, and we've seen nice execution in July going into Q3 here. The retention rate is healthy. But we're being cautious. And our profitability is on track with the way we planned the year. So, I'd say we're cautiously optimistic for the second half.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then maybe just a second one and much quicker here, on the asset base side, the non-ETF piece, I mean that was – I mean substantial growth year-over-year sequentially. I know those can be lumpy, so just wondering if this is a good run rate from here. But then, secondarily, can you just flesh this out a little bit more? I mean, this is something we used to not pay a lot of attention to and, all of a sudden, it seems like there are more, I guess, non-ETF funds like benchmarking with you. Is this something that can continue to grow at this pace, or even accelerate, or how shall we be thinking about this going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, the non-ETF passive, the largest category would be institutional funds, either separate pools or institutional mutual funds that are around the world, that are managed passively. And this would be the big passive managers in America, the Japanese cross banks running a lot of money for Japanese asset owners. For example, some of the big passive managers in Europe, and the like. So, that's the definition. Now, the majority of the money that they have been managing is market cap, and it's very sticky. And there is a one-quarter delay in the way we account for this because of the nature of counting is not publicly listed. So, we've got to do a reconciliation of the AUM with our clients. So, bear that in mind that there's always a quarter delay particularly as compared to the ETF passive. And then like now, the group dynamics that are going on in this area is in the following front: one is we have put a lot more resources of our salespeople calling on these institutional investors and spending a lot of time with them in back-testing our index strategies, and for them to pick an index. A lot of the effort is on Factors and ESG, and the fees associated with those are much higher than the fees associated with the market caps. So, we have to see how it evolves, but I would pay a lot of attention to this area because it will continue to grow at a good pace. And it may accelerate a little bit because of the incremental assets that are being managed with the new innovations like ESG or Factors or a combination of ESG and Factors at a higher level of profitability.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is actually Gregg (40:14) calling on for Manav. I just wanted to hit on the index derivative piece which also showed really strong growth, albeit it's a little bit smaller than for some of your peers. Just wondering how you guys think about the growth trajectory of this piece of the business?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well. We're very positive and optimistic about this area. We've been at it for quite a long time, a couple decades, and we started with trying to launch with our exchange partners, either (40:57) index futures contracts or single-country index futures contracts. So, the majority of the revenue in prior years was coming from the single currency, single country futures contracts, and some time ago now, five, seven years ago, working with the then NYSE Liffe USA derivatives exchange which is now ICE USA. We were able to crack the market for multi-country, multicurrency index futures contracts which is a new area in the derivative business. Most of the futures contracts around the world are single country, single currency, or in the case of the Eurozone, single currency even though multi-country. So, the area that we excel a lot is obviously multi-country, multicurrency. So, we feel good that with these two contracts, emerging market and (42:00) trading in the U.S., already thriving, that gradually we can move this model around the world. We can move more of these types of contracts into the European time zone and into the Asian time zone and the like. So, clearly, it's a small base. But we have a lot of confidence and hope that this is an area that we'll continue to grow fast in over the years.
Unknown Speaker: All right. That's helpful. And maybe as a second one. Can we just get the update on the unified platform and the rollout there? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, Just as a way of background, a lot of our Analytics content is currently sold through various types of platforms, at this point mostly MSCI platforms, some non-MSCI but mostly MSCI platforms which is, if you think of it as the Barra platform which has two, three different applications that are on a common system that's the Barra Portfolio Manager, the BarraOne, and the like, and that is mostly a factor-based multi-asset class platform. And then, the risk manager or risk metrics platform, that is a little shorter-term, multi-asset class risk management, and that has the H (43:30) platform with it. It has a credit platform and the like. So, what we're doing is building on top of that another platform, which we call the MSCI Analytics platform, that will take each one of those soft platforms, so to speak, as an engine for the interface and a lot of the orchestration of the routines are going to be done by this new platform, and therefore, aggregate all of our analytics content into one delivery mechanism as opposed to the fragmentation that we have had. And on top of that, we want to put all our content, our factor indexes, our market capital indexes, our ESG indexes, our ESG ratings, et cetera, et cetera, into that delivery mechanism in addition to continuing to sell that content through other third-party platforms and also that content directly to customers. So, we launched already a first version of this new platform, which is for now only geared towards the equity portfolio management space, i.e., the factor based equity portfolio management space. And we're in the early process of selling that. And then we are also beginning the work on adding the fixed income portfolio management into that, and then adding the multi-asset class risk management and performance attribution of that. So, we're approximately probably a year-and-a-half away from completing all the functionality of the platform in equities and fixed income and in multi-asset class. But the early test and the early showing to clients is pretty positive, obviously, it's going to take time to build up revenues on this. And there will be – the revenue that comes with it will have to be balanced between the revenue that is in the current platform and gets transferred to this platform, and, therefore, it may be a net neutral versus incremental revenues. So, we'll report on this. But we're very excited about this, but we're not yet in a position to be reporting on revenues or anything like that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning, Bill.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, you mentioned the two new wins for MSCI's U.S. indices. And I wanted to ask whether you're seeing an increased number of mandates that are looking for a combination or maybe a better way of putting it is – looking for a single-index family to cover both the U.S. and international, whether you're seeing an uptick in those. And how you're doing on those, in terms of winning them?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. That has always been the case, particularly with non-U.S. clients. We – as you know well, MSCI U.S.A. equity index as a component of our either equity or world index, is the benchmark for institutional and so many individual investors outside of the U.S. So that continues – we continue to get a significant number of mandates around the world to be benchmarked actively or passively against MSCI World, MSCI Equity (47:23) or the like, which incorporates the U.S. equity component, right? So, that continues like before. What we're very excited about that is common is our ability to compete on the basis of U.S. equity indexes, particularly with ETF managers in two categories. The larger category is innovations on ESG and Factors and the like, not just simply what we call market cap but with the overlay of an ESG screen or a Factors screen of various categories. And there is a significant number of ETFs on this area and the like. If anything, I think in the last few periods, we'll taken about 10% of the inflows of money into U.S. equity ETFs, obviously, from very low levels a few years ago. So, that's pretty positive. This particular win is about the MSCI USA market-cap indexes, not Factors, not ESG, and the like, and they will be launched in the next few months. And we're hoping that we got the ETF manager to gather assets in this category, and the hope of this manager is also to market them around the world to all those institutional clients around the world that are actually benchmarked to MSCI USA.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. So, for my second question, I'd like to ask about the share repurchases. And I know you mentioned a couple of times that there hasn't been any change to the capital allocation strategy but in looking at slide 17, it really looks like the level of repurchases versus the levels, certainly for the last two years seemed significantly lower. I understand the point on the lower volatility, but also – your gross leverage is running 3.5%, but your net leverage is down just over 2 turns. And so, that's what I wanted to ask about.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: If you look at the – first of all, the level of available cash in the U.S., net of operating cash has come down. We're at $250-or-so-million today. So, if you're going to think about the amount of excess capital that can be deployable into share repurchases now, has decreased because we've been hammering away. We can't use the non-U.S. cash, to bring it back. Well we could, but we break the glass and we have to pay taxes and all the problems on the non-U.S. cash. And obviously we need to maintain a level of, say, $100 million to $150 million of operating cash for operating purposes. So, because that level is smaller, not small, but it's smaller, relative to the past, that has allowed us to be even more opportunistic and patient about how we do what we do – purchase – we continue to believe that our stock is good value. This is not a reflection of valuation on our stock whatsoever. It's simply being opportunistic about weaknesses, softness in our stock, and volatility to be able to buyback in size. We continue to buy at all sizes, at all prices, but we're hoping that there's volatility, so we buy much more at lower prices. Again, because we're not worried about the level of excess cash, we're not worried about any of that, we're not worried about devaluation, we simply want to be – continue to be very opportunistic and smart about this process. And there's no change in that. That will continue.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. I'll just add in here a little bit, Bill. And it's a really good question, so thank you. Yeah. I mean, we look at the amount of available cash and our approach to capital allocation is consistent here. We're really disciplined about the way we look at it and being consistent about it. And when we look at the amount of cash in the U.S. that's deployable, and again, we see the international cash balances growing as we've kind of made progress here on the tax structure. But we look at the deployable U.S. cash, and we look for opportunity in terms of volatility in the market. And we're going to be really disciplined about waiting for those opportunities. We're in no rush here in that we need to be any less patient. So, we're pretty comfortable with the approach that we've taken here. We're going to be consistent with that.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: A high class problem. Thank you very much.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Alex's question from earlier on the institutional passive revenue just to make sure I understand this. So, if I look at Q2, I think you had $18.1 million of revenue in that category. A year ago, it was $12.8 million. Can you just bridge those two numbers for us or at least kind of give us order of magnitude what the big items were that drove the growth?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, sometimes these comparisons may be a little bit lumpy because, again, there are reconciliations associated with the line (53:31) that comes in reconciling all of these numbers with our clients. But I think the way to think of this is that the drivers of this AUM are in three categories: One, obviously, there has been a significant increase in equity values around the world. So, that applies to the passive equity. And therefore higher levels of passive equity at a fixed basis point fees fuels higher revenue. So, that would be one category. Second category is the same way that we all talk about the flow of assets into ETF which is our passive vehicle, there is also a flow of assets going into institutional passive. Maybe – obviously ETF is from a lower base and institutional passive is from a much higher base. And therefore, the rate of growth may not be as high but there is flows of money going into that category and that gives us a second layer of revenue. The third category is a sum of that incremental flows into institutional passive is not only in the market cap category, where our fees are lower, but it's also in the ESG and factor category where we're able to price that at a much higher level. So, when you combine those three areas, that's what's giving you that double-digit revenue growth.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Henry. I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned you now have 204 factor ETFs. I think I heard that right. But can you quantify either the AUM or the revenue from those factor ETFs, and how much of it is single factor versus multi-factor?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: The vast majority right now is single factor where the AUM is upward of $60 billion.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: It's – will be year-to-date is $65 billion.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. $65 billion in AUM in all of those ETF of all categories. As I said, the big impetus as of now has been the single factors, particularly the minimum volatility factor in our ETFs, and what we're beginning to see is demand for diversified multi-factors in which you combine say quality, value, and low volatility, as an example, so diversified. But that's still small, but that will definitely be another level of growth in the future. So, not only the single factor but the diversified multi-factor ETFs as well. And again, we're beginning to see some demand for that and some products are being launched on that, but it's not yet a big category.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. In Analytics, how much of that is product improvement versus end market and do you expect or maybe to remind us of what your long-term growth rates and margin targets are for that business?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: I'm sorry. Repeat the question, the first part of the question how much of that was what?
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: I'm wondering how much of the turn in analytics is product improvement versus end market. And then what your long-term outlook is from a growth rate perspective and margin for that business.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, it's hard to quantify because everything is about – I mean these product lines are always in a state of improvement because you're adding new models, you're adding new data, you're improving the risk management platform, the performance attribution platform, and the like. So, in any single quarter, the vast majority of your sales are based on the existing product line, not in further improvements of that product line. Although when you sell a product line like this, there is an implicit contract, social contract so to speak between us and the client that we're going to continue to evolve the product line to reflect the new asset classes or sub-asset classes or new ways to look at risk, new ways to understand performance, and the like. So, that's a constant that you want to do.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, in terms of thinking about end market and looking at the data and looking for indications of, is the end market getting better, is it less challenged? You look at the quarterly sales and cancels that we've been seeing. And as you recall, we saw elevated cancels in 2016, particularly in the back half of 2016. And that level of cancels has come down in each of the last two quarters. So, that's kind of a good signal, a good sign. From a new sales perspective, we're still kind of in that same range that we had been ex the strong Q4 that we had. But Q1, Q2 sales have been kind of in that same range. So, we're cautious here. We see some signals that could indicate that maybe it's getting a little bit better. But look, we planned the year, we planned 2017 being very cautious and we're going to continue to operate that way because it's not clear yet as to where the market's going.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: And our longer term targets here are revenue growth in the high-single-digits and EBITDA margins in the 30% to 35%.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, 30% to 35%.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. Okay. And then I want to ask a broader question. Can I have an update on your thoughts regarding the overall penetration rates for passive investing? I mean, do you expect the present rates to continue? If so, why? Or should we think about Factors and some of the other derivative products as the second phase of passive investment? I know it's a big question but...
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, no – first of all, you got to understand we sell to both, to active managers and passive managers. So, if you think about – in the subscription, whether index subscription or analytics subscription, a category that's an equivalent to selling into active managers around the world. Not totally but mostly, right? And, obviously the passive data reflected, the sales to passive accounts are reflected in the (01:00:41). So, we're hedged (01:00:45) both ways. There has been a lot of discussion about how high can passive go and our view is that it could go very high. Now will it continue at this level? It could but you're beginning to see some recovery of the active management process by differentiation, by concentration of portfolios. It's hard to add an incredible amount of value as an active manager when you have asset prices being controlled by non-monetary policy or macro events or things like that. So, as these monetary injections begin to decrease and as you have more volatility in the market and if you have bull and bear markets and the like, the value of active will come back and we're banking on that and that's where – are helping a lot of our clients but passive can continue to increase also significantly.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Morning.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Morning.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, index margins were about 73% this quarter above the high end of your long-term target and I know one quarter doesn't make a trend, but I would expect at least part of the strength there came from the strong result in the high incremental asset based fee business. So, as long as the asset levels sort of stay where they are or go up, as long as they don't decline significantly, like should we expect index margins to continue to be around this level? And so what do you think of the persistency of it as well as just the long-term targets you have for this business?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Toni. Yeah, so for the quarter, we were outside. We're above that 68% to 72% long-term target range. As you noted, particularly strength on the ABS side. But from a short-term perspective, you can see that happen sometimes quarter-to-quarter depending on what's happening with the market appreciation or depreciation and what's happening with AUM. So, on a short-term basis, in a particular quarter, you could see us go up or down. Now, look, our job is to look at that set of conditions in the environment and, say, make an assessment about, look, how sustained is this going to be, and then planning accordingly. For now, we're sticking with that 68% to 72%. We think that range continues to make sense as a targeted range of profitability.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then during the quarter, BlackRock announced its intention to launch several new funds based on its own indices. I was just hoping you could share your thoughts on self-indexing. Do you view it as a threat to part of the business? Where could, I guess, self-indexing see some traction versus where will asset managers continue to use the traditional indices from third parties? And, obviously, you haven't seen any sort of slowdown in adoption of your indices. So, just trying to figure out how much of a long-term threat self-indexing is and if there's a place for both. Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes. So, self-indexing is one more kind of permutation of indices that can be created that are very, very different to MSCI indices. So, I like to always remind people that over decades, maybe there were not self-indexing approaches, but there's always a lot of family of indices that exist that are listing equities that you could get for even a lower price than you building self-indexing capability. And today, those indices exist, and maybe there's even more indices in this family that exist in that category. So, we, at MSCI, it's always been, thinking about in a competition with that. And what we focus on is what is our value proposition, what is the ecosystems that we have built in terms of the benchmark and institutional investors and other form of investors around the world that are following MSCI indexes and the amount of active and passive funds, the amount of the derivative contracts around the world and the like. And we feel very, very good about that ecosystem and we feel extremely good about that value of our brand and the value of our proposition. So, there will be people that go with extremely low cost index provider, or in some cases, may even self-index. That's normal. It has happened in the past. But what we do is a completely different area, a completely different category. Our value proposition is very different than all of that.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had another follow-up on analytics, more on the profitability side. Could you speak to the factors that give you the confidence on improved levels of profitability in the second half of 2017? Is that coming from pullback in the pace of investment spend or is it largely predicated on the better revenue growth you've talked about? And is that sustainable into 2018? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: It's definitely sustainable, obviously there's been a bit here because of the lower revenue growth associated with the quarter, and therefore, you adjust down your costs on the basis of that, right? But I think what you see in this product line is that we're cautiously optimistic that there will be an acceleration in revenue on this based on a lot of what we're going to do to the product line, the repositioning of the product line, as an example, in addition to selling tools for people to use the tools, we're also doing the work for clients in the form of services and solutions, and the like. We're also integrating the various parts as I talked about before of the product line and the like. And very importantly embedded in this profitability is a very significant amount of investments that we're making to reposition that product line. So, we could show margins that are significantly higher than this if we were just investing in the business. Obviously, it's not a good thing because then, you're not going to end up growing in the future. So, we feel very comfortable about the prospects of this additional profitability, and obviously, what we're really trying hard is to accelerate the revenue growth.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: So, look – we're looking at the pipeline every day. And the pipeline looks very healthy right now. We had a decent sales quarter in Q2, sales were up 8%, yet we still have a healthy pipeline. We had several large deals that kind of slipped from closing in Q2 to the closing in the early days of Q3. We are looking at how we're executing in terms of closing deals in kind of month one and starting month two here of the quarter and we're pretty happy with how we're executing. We look at the retention rate. The retention rate has been up the last couple of quarters. And you may recall, we planned the year pretty conservatively and from a profitability perspective for 2017, the way we planned the year was that we would expect to have margin rates at or about the same level of the exit rate in 2016. Based on how we've progressed the first half of the year, we think that is how the year will play out.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And for a second question, I wanted to ask about the integrated content applications and services. Could you speak to where you're having the most success from a client perspective? Clearly, there seems to be a broad appeal here with many types of clients, but the $55 million plus incremental run rate you guys talk about coming from this integration, have you had more success in penetrating any particular type of client that you'd call out?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, the most success because we've been at it the longest is in the integration of equity risk models and equity indices to create factor indices. And that it has been – that was what we started doing at the time of the Barra acquisition some 10 years, 12 years ago, 12-13 years ago. It took a while for the market clearly to develop. So, since the financial crisis we began to see quite a lot of that and we're extremely well-positioned to be the leading provider of that because we have both. We have an extremely well-known expertise in building equity risk models. I mean, we have an extremely well-known expertise in building equity indices, so the combination of that is extremely powerful. We are now seeing quite a lot of growth in using the same process between the ESG ratings and the ESG indices. So, if we take a lot of the – in a different way. But if you take a lot of how we look at companies and we weight them on the basis of ratings associated with a lot of this ESG criteria. And then, we say, okay, how can we – how do we build an index to be the basis of our portfolio on that. And that is embedded in the equity index of run rate somewhere around $14 million, $15 million in run rate at the moment, and growing about 50-plus percent a year which is significant upside on that as well. So, that's another category – some of our multi-asset class, analytic sales, particularly to asset owners like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, it'll need to have an equity risk model for real estate, because real estate is an important allocation of that. So, we've taken the real estate data coming out of the real estate product line and our research people have built a private equity real estate risk model then compare and contrast with the equity-risk model, the (1:12:08) risk models in order to create that holistic multi-asset class risk and performance solution. So, that's another area. So again, all of these things is early days. In all of this, we believe that there's a lot more money in this sort of cross pollination of the product line.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. (1:12:46-1:12:58) or what else would give you that confidence that the analytics (1:13:00-1:13:06)?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: We couldn't really hear you. Your line kind of breaks down quite a lot. So, we couldn't really hear the question at all.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Let me see if I can rephrase that. The question is regarding the Analytical segment and the ability to reach the high-single-digit on a sustained basis. (1:13:23) confidence we have for the second half of the year. What gives you the confidence that beyond the second half of the year that the Analytical area can grow in the high single digits?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think if I understood the question correctly, in terms of confidence and eventually high-single-digit growth rate in Analytics, I think there are two, three sort of explanations to that. One is some competitor, there are not too many competitors in this space, but some competitors are growing faster than we are and we know why, right? So, that's gives us confidence on this. Secondly, the big area here where we feel there is a lot more growth and we are better positioned at it is the – think of it as the buy side, where the asset owners, the asset managers and some hedge funds, so that's an area that we do well, so we're growing pretty fast on asset owners around the world. We have been recently growing well in the asset management community because they need particularly, clearly the asset managers, they need all these tools to manage their business and lower their operating cost in their business. So, that gives us confidence. Three – I think that we have grown well, despite the fragmentation that we have in our product line between the factor-based approach and the pricing stress test event approach. And we feel that once we combine that, all of that content into a more holistic way and have one way to distribute that through our analytical application that's going to help us. And lastly, right now, we mostly have been selling tools for our clients to use the tools. If we add our ability to do the work for our clients in our local centers around the world, that should add another layer of growth. So again, all of that transformation will take time, but that's what keeps us confident.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. I hear this question from investors from time to time, in addition (1:15:42) indexes, do you see that as a growth vehicle? I guess in more detail, how would you see that as additional growth for you guys?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: China, talking about China. Look, first of all, I mean these are two separate parts of the company, right? The editorial decisions of the company do not get influenced by what happens and those that happen on the commercial part of the company. We try to remain extremely independent on that. How we made the decision of a small amount of inclusion on China A-shares into our indices, we have received a lot of interest by global inventors. Obviously in China A-share indices and the modules and the data in order for them to complete all of that in their emerging market index. We have been receiving quite a lot of inquiries about the launch of ETFs on China A-share or portfolios that have China A-shares in them, and we have some of that in the pipeline. Another example, a lot of Chinese asset managers that are looking at risk models to be able to manage China A-shares in the context of global portfolios, they're not there yet but they want to prepare themselves for that. So, that's – that definitely is a layer of growth that can come in Asia and around the world on China A-share. But again, it's been a separate decision between what the editorial people have done versus commercial.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon. Hopefully, just a couple of quick short questions for you here. The first is as you guys start to grow your international cash, does that potentially change your M&A strategy maybe looking to use that cash for foreign acquisitions?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, we have always looked at any kind of acquisition whether it's U.S. and overseas. And we've been very disciplined about what we look at and we are – we have certain return hurdles that we're not going to deviate from or whatever. That's going to apply to the international cash as well. I mean, there are other people that put a lower threshold of return on their international cash, so that's a negative threshold of return because that's money that is burning a hole in their pocket. We're not going to do that whatsoever. We feel it's capital. It's dropped capital, but there may be other ways to use it, right? But we are always constantly looking at the M&A environment regardless of what it is. And if it is outside and we can use the international cash with similar hurdle rates as we do anywhere else, that'd be great.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. That's fair. And then for my follow-up, is there any impact on the retirement of Barclays POINT in terms of some of the strong closed sales that you've been seeing in the Analytics segment?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Marginally, I think what we've done is clearly we've significantly increased our capabilities in fixed income overall. We're doing that in fixed income mortgages as well right in the mortgage sector of fixed income and we clearly have increased significantly our capabilities and solutions and applications for fixed income portfolio managers, and we certainly have been talking to a lot those clients that are faced with the decision as to what to do, right, in terms of replacing that system. So, early days, at this point, we have gotten with the area where we've gotten good success has been a few in fixed income portfolio management, but quite a few actually in multi-asset class risk management. All on the basis of all the great work we've done to strengthen our fixed income capabilities.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I'm not showing any further questions, and would like to turn the call back over to Stephen Davidson.
Stephen C. Davidson - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you very much for your interest in MSCI and have a great day. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stephen C. Davidson - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew. Good day, and welcome to the MSCI first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter 2017. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent form 10-K and other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on Pages 26 to 30 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good day to everyone on the phone. Apologies for my scratchy voice as I suffer from pollen allergies at this time of the year. We reported another strong quarter, driven by the continued execution of our strategy, our focus on innovation and our drive to higher levels of integration within client activities, our content, our content-enabling applications and our services. Our results included a positive impact of about 27% increase year-over-year in quarter end AUM, in ETF linked to our indices to a record $555 billion, driving strong double-digit growth in Index revenues. On our call today, I will review the financial highlights for the quarter. And then, I will discuss how our financial performance is increasingly benefiting from more innovation and better integration of content within each product line as well as across product lines in the enterprise. Please turn to slide four for a review of our financial results for first quarter 2017. A 29% increase in adjusted EPS was driven by an 8% increase in operating revenue, a 3% increase in adjusted EBITDA expenses, a 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA and lower effective tax rate and an 8% decrease in diluted share count. Furthermore, we delivered a strong overall aggregate retention rate of 95%, with Index at an impressive aggregate retention rate of 97%. We have achieved these strong results because the management team is focused on three areas, as we have reported to you each quarter. We are focused on investing in new products, enhancing existing products and ramping up our go-to-market strategy with clients to drive revenue growth. Striving for further operating efficiency and productivity gains to free up resources for both to invest in our business and further improve our profitability and ensuring that capital is optimally deployed to enhance shareholder returns. First, in terms of revenue growth, we recorded an 8% increase in revenue, driven principally by a 13% growth in Index revenue. Excluding the foreign exchange impact on subscription revenues, overall operating revenues would have increased 9%. This was the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit growth in Index subscription run rate, which is a testament to the strength of our equity index franchise, the contribution from many new products, as well as our go-to-market strategies. The strong increase in AUM and ETF linked to MSCI indices this quarter helped drive an 18% increase in asset-based fees. Analytics revenue grew 2% on a reported basis, or 3% on a foreign exchange adjusted basis. We are clearly aiming for higher growth in this product line through our investments, and are taking steps to accelerate the next stage of the evolution of the Analytics product line. These steps that we're taking will help further drive the transformation of Analytics into a more client-centric and solutions-based product line. I will discuss this important evolution later. All Other revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 12% on an organic basis and excluding the impact of foreign exchange. ESG continues to register strong top-line growth or about 17% year-over-year this quarter. This offset in this product line is being driven by the increasing integration of ESG factors into the mainstream global investment process. In Real Estate, reported revenues decreased 3%. But on an organic basis and excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenues increased 8%. The restructuring of the Real Estate product line is still in progress and has resulted in a significant improvement in profitability, but we have more work to do. Turning to operational efficiency, our adjusted EBITDA expenses increased only 3%, and 5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by our continued and relentless effort on efficiency and productivity gains, while at the same time investing in our business to drive further growth. Finally, in terms of capital allocation and capital optimization, we continue to be good stewards of capital and have been very opportunistic in repurchasing our stock to ensure that we're maximizing value for shareholders, and we will continue to follow this strategy as we have indicated many times before. In summary, to us, first quarter 2017 was another very good quarter, especially in the very large part of our business that drives growth, profitability and valuation of the firm. Please turn to slide five, where we highlight the power of the integrated franchise that MSCI brings to clients to help them make better and more efficient investment decisions. This integration is evident within three distinct areas, our approach to client relationships, especially the C-Suite in our largest accounts, the development of our content across all product lines, and then thirdly, our applications and services that enable the use of that content by our client. Please turn to slide six, where we highlight the strength of our client base, which we believe is benefiting from the better integration of client initiatives like our strategic account management program. As shown on the left side of this slide, a growing percentage of our overall run rate is attributable to clients who are buying from all product lines in the company, increasing from 38% of total run rate in the first quarter of 2015 to 47% of total run rate in the first quarter of 2017. This growth in clients buying all of our products is being driven by our go-to-market strategy and our ability to better cross-sell our products. On the right side of the slide, we highlight the run rate from clients that have more than $1 million of run rate, which are growing faster than the overall growth of the company and have higher levels of retention. There have been several recent deals which reflect the increase in integration of our go-to-market strategy. Let me illustrate this with three examples. First, a very large employee retirement system in the U.S. selected MSCI for a full set of solutions across index, multi-asset class risk, Real Estate and ESG as a result of our integrated client facing and integrated product approach, resulting in over $1 million in run rate from this client in this combined sale. Second example, a large global asset manager in Europe selected RiskManager, not only because of the strength of this product, but also because we leveraged our C-Suite and existing Index and ESG product relationships, all coordinated by our senior account manager on that specific client. This resulted also in over $1 million of additional run rate from this account. A third example, we leveraged our deep Analytics relationship with a very large public employee pension fund in America to win a real estate index benchmark mandate, expanding the relationship beyond risk to index, real estate and ESG with this particular account. So we're very pleased with these significant wins, which reflect an increasingly integrated approach within and across our product and sales activities. Turning to slide 7, we illustrate the current state of integration of our content by asset classes. MSCI is largely a content company. And we're known mostly for our equity index content but also increasingly for our factor, ESG and other analytical content, and also the analytical content-enabling applications that we provide. On this slide, which is obviously related to content, we highlight the select content that we generate within each asset class as indicated in the top half of the chart, as well as select content that is common across all asset classes as indicated on the bottom half of the chart. An example of content integration across asset classes will be factor investing content. When you look at our total run rate related to equity factors across all product lines in the company, it is over $180 million, and is growing at a rate of approximately 13% this past quarter compared to last year. ESG content will be another example where we're leveraging ESG content to create indices. The run rate of ESG indices embedded in the Index segment, not in the ESG segment, is approximately $13 million, and grew by over 55% compared to prior year. One underlying theme in these examples is how our non-index product line content benefits our Index segment, which is of course our most valuable and profitable franchise at MSCI. On slide 8, 9 and 10, we highlight the integration of our Index, ESG and Analytics content as well as the client demand trends that we're driving to generate growth. First, let us begin with Index on slide 8. We are focused on tighter integration of our content within this segment, as well, of course, as across segments. So for example, we're looking at new ways to monetize our Index content using new business models and integrating it within our Analytics application for delivery to our clients. For example, we are looking to deliver our Index metrics reports through our Analytics applications. Index metric is our analytical tool to sell factor indices to both passive managers and active managers. The client demand for our content, as shown on the right side of this slide is being driven by the globalization of the equity investing process, which continues unabated, the trend towards lower cost index-based equity investment products, which is obviously accelerating, and the demand for factors which is on a tier. Next slide highlights the ESG content on slide nine. Client demand for our ESG content is being driven by investors' focus on ESG criteria to evaluate the risk and the alpha in their portfolios. As a result, therefore, ESG is being integrated into the mainstream investment process across the world. For example, our ESG ratings content is now available, but only in content format but also through third-party applications and through our own applications like RiskManager and some of our clients are accessing the ESG content through BarraOne. As I mentioned before, ESG reserves have been integrated within the Index segment in the creation of ESG equity indices, which are therefore reported in that segment. Lastly, we're integrating ESG reserves and ratings with factor exposure to provide our clients with an integrated – thoroughly integrated perspective of the equity market, which would include not only the market caps but the factors and ESG and you can build, therefore, the entire equity universe according to those factors and areas. Lastly, we highlight Analytics content, and in this case, also applications on Slide 10. As we all know, investment institutions around the world are under significant pressure, which is causing them to focus on their investment processes more keenly. They're becoming much more – or trying to become much more efficient and more integrated, and they're looking for a more client-centric solutions-based approach from their partners such as MSCI. To meet the demands of the changing market, we are quickly evolving our Analytics product area and we're doing this in three ways. First, we're helping clients arch complexity in their investment processes. Therefore, this is driving a lot of the costs and inefficiencies in their organization. Secondly, we are helping clients achieve a high level of integration in all of those investment processes, so that they can achieve efficiencies and cost-savings. And lastly, we are meeting our clients' needs for increased and deeper services and solutions to make more effective use of analytical tools. Some of these clients, for example, say not only give me the tools so I can do things myself, but can you do the work for me and I'll pay you more for it? Please turn to slide 11, where we highlight the next phase in the evolution of the Analytics product line. In just the last two years, we have made significant progress in this transformation in moving to a more integrated, more client-centric and more profitable organization. And while we have been doing this, we have also been self-funding this great new initiative that are positioning the product line for our further growth and will enhance our transformation. And this will include a great deal of fixed income Analytics, not only for fixed income portfolio managers, but strengthening fixed income analytics for the multi-asset class process. The new Analytics platform that will integrate all of our content through one-delivery mechanism, and then thirdly, manage services and solutions to help clients enable those analytical tools, and in some cases, do the work for them. In 2017 and beyond, our keen focus is on driving top-line growth in this product line. We expect to achieve higher growth rates by evolving our Analytics product line in three primary ways, as I mentioned before. First, we are increasing the delivery of all content at MSCI through integrated Analytics applications. Next, we're focused on creating an integrated processing environment, internal processing, computer processing environment and superior content-enabling applications that are interfacing with the client. And then lastly, we are increasing our focus on client-centric services and solutions to enable our clients better use our tools. By evolving to this model and this transformation, we'll be able to provide our clients with a more efficient performance and risk environment, where they have the tools to make better investment decisions and reduce their cost and their competitive advantage. In the coming quarters, we will continue to provide you with updates on this progress and integrating these multiple facets of our powerful franchise at MSCI, including our client activities, content, content-enabling applications and services, which represent significant opportunities for growth. I believe that we're only getting started in what is possible to achieve with this franchise. Kathleen?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Henry, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll start on slide 12, where I'll take you through our first quarter results. As you can see, we clearly continued the momentum we had coming out of 2016. While Q4 had strong revenue growth of 7%, 8% adjusting for FX, and adjusted EPS growth of 23% year-over-year, Q1 is even stronger. Let me take you through the numbers. In Q1 we delivered an 8% increase in revenue, driven primarily by a 6% increase in recurring subscription revenue and an 18% increase in asset-based fee revenue. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, total operating revenues increased 9%. As a reminder, we do not provide the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our asset-based fees tied to average AUM. This is substantially billed and booked in U.S. dollars; however, approximately two-thirds of the underlying assets are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. On a reported basis, operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses increased by 3% each. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, first quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 4.8% and 5.3%, respectively. The primary currency move that drove this benefit was the British pound, which was substantially weaker year-over-year. We delivered a 15% increase in operating income and a 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA, resulting in a 280 basis point increase in our operating margin and a 220 basis point increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 50%. Our effective tax rate was 28.2%, below the 33.5% effective tax rate in the prior year Q1. Diluted EPS and adjusted EPS increased 33% and 29%, respectively. Q1 free cash flow was $27.4 million, a decrease of $4 million. This was driven by higher cash operating expenses, higher interest payments of $11.5 million associated with higher debt levels, and higher CapEx of $4.2 million, primarily related to our data centers. These factors were partially offset by higher cash collections of $37 million. As we mentioned in our Q4 earnings call, we saw very strong customer collections in Q4 2016, with some clients paying early, which resulted in the bringing forward (23:36) of about $20 million in collections into 2016, which would've normally been collected in Q1, thus dampening free cash flow in this quarter. In summary, this was another very good quarter coming off 2016, which was a banner year for the company. We're continuing to execute our strategy, which is resulting in strong top-line growth. We have very high levels of client retention, 95% across the company, and we're focused on continuing to deliver productivity and efficiency gains to free up more capital to invest and we're exercising very strong discipline in the deployment of that capital. On slide 13, you can see the different drivers of EPS growth in Q1. Adjusted EPS increased $0.20, or 29%, from $0.68 per share to $0.88 per share. Strong revenue growth contributed $0.17 per share. Investments, net of efficiencies in our product segments and operations, reduced earnings by $0.06. And capital optimization, specifically share repurchases, also benefited EPS. We reduced our average weighted diluted share count by 8%, which benefited adjusted EPS by $0.07, partially offset by higher net interest expense resulting in a net $0.03 per share benefit. The positive impact of share-based compensation excess tax benefits and the ongoing progress in better aligning our tax profile with our operating footprint, as well as additional discrete tax items resulted in a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, which benefited earnings by $0.06 per share. The positive impact of stock-based compensation excess tax benefits totaled $3.1 million in the quarter at $0.03, and reflects the required accounting change effective Q1 2017 on a prospective basis. Now let's turn to the segment results. We'll begin with the Index segment on slides 14 through 16. Revenues for Index increased 13%, driven primarily by an 18% increase in asset-based fee revenue and a 9% increase in recurring subscriptions. We saw growth in core products, as well as our newer products, including factor, thematic and custom index products and usage fees. Quarterly sales of $19 million increased 11%, and were driven by recurring subscription sales of $14 million. The increase reflects our ongoing success in capturing the waves of innovation in the market such as strong demand for factor modules, as well as increasing demand for ESG. Aggregate retention rate remained high at approximately 97% in the quarter compared to 96% in the prior year. Index run rate grew by $81 million or 14% compared to March 31, 2016. This was driven by a $42 million or 21% increase in asset-based fee run rate and a $39 million or a 10% increase in subscription run rate. We're continuing our track record of growth. This was the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit growth in our Index subscription run rate. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Index was 70.8% this quarter versus 69.2% in Q1 2016. The impact of FX on Index results was not significant. In summary, this was a very strong performance for the Index product line, driven by strength in core product areas as well as a strong contribution from our newer Index product areas reflecting the benefit of the investments that we have made and continue to make. This is a great start to the year. Turning to slide 15 you have detail on our asset-based fees. Starting with the upper left chart, overall asset-based fees increased $9 million or 18% over Q1 2016, driven by a $7 million or 21% increase in revenue from ETF linked to MSCI indexes and a 28% increase in average AUM and a $2 million or 13% increase in revenue from non-ETF passive funds. The decline in our non-ETF passive product compared to the fourth quarter was principally due to higher revenue accrual true-up in initial fund fees in Q4 of $1.1 million. So it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Also, unlike ETFs, where the latest AUM is available daily to public market data sources, non-ETF passive assets are not public and are reported by our clients to us generally on a one-quarter lag. As a result, the first quarter market appreciation which we saw for ETFs is not yet reflected in the non-ETF path product results. Turning to the upper right chart, we ended the first quarter with approximately $556 billion in period-end ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes, driven by both cash inflows of $38.5 billion and market appreciation of $36 billion for the quarter. Cash inflows of $38.5 billion into ETF linked to MSCI indexes represented 26% of the cash inflows into the equity ETF market for the quarter. Since the end of the quarter and through May 2, ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes has further increased to $581 billion, driven by $11 billion in inflows and $14 billion in market appreciation, another all-time high. As shown in the lower left chart, quarter-end AUM by market exposure of ETFs linked to MSCI indexes reflected our strength in developed markets ex-U.S. where we captured 30% of the equity ETF inflows and in emerging markets where ETFs linked to our indexes captured 84% of the equity ETF inflows, further solidifying our position as a leading provider of indexes to ETF providers. Lastly, on the lower right chart, you can see the average run rate basis point fee at 3.08, which has basically leveled off over the last four quarters. I'd explain the year-over-year decline in basis point fee in more detail on the next slide. On slide 16, we provide you with the asset-based fee run rate related to ETFs, as well as the AUM of ETFs linked to our indexes classified in three distinct categories, illustrating a differentiated index licensing strategy. In the upper half of the chart, we highlight the growth of our asset-based fee run rate, specifically related to ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. Year-over-year, our run rate increased 21%, driven by strong inflows as well as market appreciation, which drove a 28% increase in average ETF AUM linked to our indexes. The difference between the 21% growth in run rate compared to the 28% increase in average AUM was driven principally by the product mix, as shown in the lower half of the chart. Turning now to the lower half of the chart, you can see how we think about our ETF licensing strategy. This strategy is designed to further expand our index licensing franchise for the ETF market beyond our flagship indexes, increasing the adoption of new Index Families and U.S. segment index families. Year-over-year, the flagship Index Families' total AUM decreased to 71% of total AUM linked to MSCI indexes from 75% in the prior year first quarter. The new Index Families continue to grow at a faster pace, specifically driven by flows into core and U.S. factor products. For new Index Families, AUM increased 14% of total AUM from 10% in the prior year first quarter. The faster growth in the lower fee ETF linked to our indexes was a primary driver of the year-over-year decline in the average basis point fee from 3.24 to 3.08. While we expect to have periods where product mix will impact the average fee we earn, through our differentiated licensing strategy, we're seeking to maximize revenue and optimize the price volume trade-off over the long-term. On slide 17, we highlight the financials for the Analytics segment. Revenues for Analytics increased 2% to $112 million. Excluding the impact of FX, Analytics revenue increased 3.3%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher equity model revenue. Analytics run rate at March 31 grew by $10 million or 2% to $457 million, and increased 3% excluding the impact of FX. The year-over-year revenue comparison reflects the negative impact of the challenging back half of 2016, specifically the elevated level of cancels in the last three quarters of the prior year, which impacted our run rate immediately. We believe therefore that the lower level of revenue growth in the quarter is more of a lagging indicator. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.3%, down from 27.5% in the prior year. The lower adjusted EBITDA margin rate was driven by the investments in strategic products and services. While quarterly margin rates can be somewhat lumpy, we continue to expect the full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA margin rate in Analytics to be flat or slightly better than the Q4 2016 exit margin rate for the product line, which was 28.7%. Slide 18 provides you with the sales and cancels for the Analytics product segment for the last five quarters. Our Analytics offering continues to be viewed as mission-critical by our clients, as evidenced by our very strong client retention. However, challenging market conditions continue to impact select client segments. The market is evolving and changing and this is putting tremendous pressure on clients. This changing market is driving clients to focus on becoming more efficient, better integrating technology and data and also to look for more services and solutions from their partners. We're evolving our Analytics product area to meet these new demands. Q1 2017 recurring sales of $12 million were down slightly compared to Q1 prior year. We saw strength in some client segments and continued weakness in others. Specifically, the year-over-year decline in sales was driven by lower sales to wealth managers due to the lumpy nature of sales into this segment, combined with continued weakness in multi-strategy and macro hedge funds. This was partially offset by strong growth in the asset management segment and the banking segment. As a reminder, we had very low cancels in Q1 last year, but saw an increased level of cancels in Q2 through Q4 last year, which was largely driven by four clients. Q1 2017 cancels are at recent historic levels and aggregate retention rate has rebounded to over 93% in the quarter, up significantly from 87% in Q4. The year-over-year increase in cancels was driven by multi-strategy macro hedge funds and is the result of the challenging market conditions for this client segment. While we're pleased that the level of cancels is more in line with recent historic levels and retention has improved relative to the last three quarters, we remain focused on increasing the level of sales in the Analytics product line. Importantly, the Q1 level of sales and cancels are in line with the planning assumptions we made for 2017 and the pipeline for the remainder of 2017 is strong. However, until we see less cost pressure on clients and see a decline in closures of hedge funds, we expect to continue to see challenging conditions, and this is in line with our planning for 2017. Turning to slide 19, we show results for the All Other segment. Revenues for All Other increased 6% to $25 million on a reported basis and grew 12% after adjusting for the disposal of the occupiers benchmarking business and the impact of FX. First, in terms of ESG, a $2 million or 17% increase in ESG revenue to $13 million was due to strong ESG ratings revenue. Growth in ESG continues to be driven by the increasing integration of ESG into the mainstream of the investment process. Real Estate revenues decreased slightly to $13 million on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and the sale of the Real Estate occupiers business, Real Estate revenues increased 8%. Aggregate retention rate for the All Other segment remains high at 92%. The All Other adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.8%, up from 11.4% in the prior year. The increase in the adjusted EBITDA margin rate was driven by continued strong growth in ESG revenue, as well as lower Real Estate costs, primarily due to a reduction in head count and strong cost management, as we made continued progress toward improving profitability in our Real Estate product line. Turning to slide 20, you have an update on our capital return activity. In Q1 and through April 28, we repurchased and settled a total of 1.1 million shares. Since 2012, we've returned almost $2.4 billion through share repurchases and dividends and we've repurchased 36 million shares of the company. There was $0.8 billion remaining on our outstanding share repurchase authorization as of April 28. On slide 21, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $697 million. This includes $250 million of cash held outside the U.S. and a domestic cash cushion of approximately $125 million to $150 million, which as a general policy, we maintain for operational purposes. Our growth leverage was 3.6 times at the end of the quarter, down from 3.7 times at the end of the fourth quarter. Over time, we expect that we will return to our stated range of 3 times to 3.5 times as our adjusted EBITDA grows. Lastly, before we open the line for Q&A, on slide 22, we are reaffirming our full-year 2017 guidance. Furthermore, we are also reaffirming our long-term targets. In summary, we continued to execute against the MSCI algorithm this quarter, delivering strong upper single-digit revenue growth. We're investing for growth and creating a more efficient infrastructure, while at the same time, achieving productivity and efficiency gains, driving a modest 3% growth in expenses. The strong operating results drove double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, which when combined with a 530 basis point decline in our tax rate and an 8% decline in our share count drove a 29% increase in adjusted EPS. We are well positioned given macro tailwinds, and we're executing well against our strategy, and we're optimistic about our prospects for continued growth. With that, we'll open the line to take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning, Bill.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So I noticed the improvement in the index retention rate there, looking on a year-over-year basis. So it's already at pretty high level, and to be able to bump it up another 60 bps, what has been driving that? And is that a reflection of some of the cross-selling?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: I think it's, Bill, a variety of factors. But very importantly, at the core, this is a very critical – mission-critical growth that clients need to have. In this case, active managers and with the continued pressure on active managers by passive products, many of them obviously benchmark to or index to MSCI indices, then the client needs to be a lot more focused on the performance against the index. Because the index is the competition to passive, right? So therefore, the essential and criticality of this product line has increased and that has allowed us to sell more into them, to sell more modules of all types and the likes of those. So that's one area. And the second area, just referring to the module selling factoring those module, small-cap modules, I mean small-cap is poised to do well in kind of an inflation rate and domestically in many countries, so that's another aspect over there.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. And then I also wanted as my follow-up, ask about the Analytics business. That's one where you talked about the challenges in the retention in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, so last year, on – if you look at the – you showed improvement on a quarter-to-quarter basis for the retention rate, but if you look at it year-over-year, which is probably more meaningful, that was still down. What does it take to get that revenue growth back to the mid-single digits or up to the mid-single digit?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes, so just to, first of all, address the retention, right, the first thing to understand and when you compare it to all of the people in this space is that our Analytics product line is – it's a lot of products to a very diversified client base. So we sell a lot to Asia, multi-strategy in Asia, for example. We sell a lot to European – Continental European asset managers, right? We sell a lot to asset owners and to global asset managers and to wealth managers, some of them owned by banks and the like. So therefore, in order to really understand the retention, it's always important to go underneath the hood, not just the aggregate retention, and say where are the areas of strength and the areas of weakness of that retention? And clearly, the areas of weakness in the last 12 months or so have been the multi-strategy hedge funds, haven't done that well and have been cutting costs. The wealth managers that are owned by European banks and some American banks that even though their wealth management business has done well, they just give orders to cut across cost-savings, across the whole divisions and the like. Now, in order to get to the second half of the question is how do we get these sales up, right? Largely, the way to think about it is that there are largely two – and very generically two segments of this market. One is the people that are self-helped. They want tools for them to do the work and they want some of the tools that are applied to fixed income only or fixed equity only or the central office of risk only on that and that market is still vibrant and is still there and that's where we're highly well positioned. And the other part of the market is a market that is saying, look, I don't longer want a lot of that. I don't want the tools. I want people to do it for me. I fire all those people and I'm closing down those areas and can you do it for me and therefore can you give me an integrated data platform, and integrated application and integrated processing and solutions and services and just do it for me. So that's the area that we are doing some work. We clearly are – we're trying to get a lot of that revenue, but that's the area that in addition to the tool side, self-help tools, that's the area where we can see – we're positioning ourselves to see significant growth.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Well, thank you for the...
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Hi, Bill, it's Kathleen. Let me just add a couple of more comments to what Henry said. Just to give you a little more specificity around the retention rate. Sure, we're up versus Q4, as you'd expect to see that seasonality impact, right?
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Right.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: But important to note that we're up versus each of the last three quarters from a retention rate perspective. Now obviously, not back up to where we were Q1 2016, so we've got more work to do there. But the way we're doing that is focusing on where we see pockets of strength, right? In particular, sales for Analytics in the quarter we saw strength in multi-asset class asset managers. In fact, net new sales were up over 40% for that client segment in Q1. So focusing there, as well as demand in the banking segment for risk solutions.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you for the insight.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, guys, good morning. Question on the EBITDA expense, just the cadence as we think about over the course of the year. I think you said in the past that Q1 is a seasonally high quarter for EBITDA expense. So maybe just help us with how much of the expense in Q1 falls out of the P&L in Q2? And just given that seasonality, I'm just curious on the maintenance of the expense guide and if it's conservatism or if you're expecting expense levels to ramp over the course of the year?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, you'll see it ramp up, maybe slightly, but nothing very substantial here. And I think the commentary with regard to Q1 was more around it being a heavily tasked quarter if you're referring to the comments from last earnings release.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. But is that...
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: ...heavy cash usage.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Q1 is not necessarily seasonally strong in terms of expense?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Well, look, as we continue to invest, you'll see it ramp up slightly as we go through the year.
Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, a little different question on the – I just wanted to get an update on the Analytics platform, the integrated platform, just what timing is there.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, so we are – because the new Analytics platform is ready to be rolled out for the equity investing process. So we're positioning this in the first day for equity and factor investing and all of that and that we are very excited about that because then we can sell equity factor models, equity indices to that and all sorts of analysis, et cetera, et cetera. And that's – we're within a few days or weeks of launching it to the marketplace. The next phase of this will be to then, which we're really excited, do a work on expanding the Analytics platform to the multi-asset class risk side and particularly to put a lot of the fixed income analytics that we have been building, that's probably going to take us a year or so before we can release that to the marketplace, so that's where we are on that.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. I was wondering if you could frame for us the size and the impact of the new products. I think you said factor investing was $116 million, maybe growing 13% and I didn't really catch ESG, maybe at $13 million. But what's the size of the full suite there? And maybe some growth rates and what else could be considered one of the new products?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, so the – and these are examples. I mean we don't plan to be providing this level of granularity in our quarterly reports but if you look at the totality of the run rate of the company, $1.2 billion. And instead of looking at it from the prism of the product operating segments like Index and ESG and Real Estate, Analytics and all of that, you look at it across from equity factors only. Equity factors, not all factors. Because we have stopped these fixed income factors where a lot of the BarraOne revenues are about a multifactor models, that is called the MSCI multifactor model and the like. So – but if you look at equity factors only, that revenue across all product lines is more than $180 million and grew 13%, right, in the last 12 months. And that is composed of equity factor indices, equity factor models and all the ancillary services and permutations to all of that. So that was that example that I used. Now the – and we are very focused on equity factor investing, because that's a big wave that is going on in the world. And we will like to see that sort of – that across the product line revenue or run rate continued to grow at a double-digit rate, and that's one metric that we used to analyze how well we're doing on equity factors. Now, when you look at ESG, it's a different example that I was giving, but what I was saying is that again, going back to the cross in relation between product lines is the equity index team is taking all the IP associated with the ESG research, the rating, the company formation and everything, and we've created ESG indices that are coming out of the entire cost structure that is embedded into ESG. And that revenue of ESG indices, which is embedded in Index, even though the cost structure is embedded in ESG, is embedded in Index, is now on a 13% run rate and that is – I'm sorry, $13 million, and that is actively managed subscription fees and passively managed ABS and not the base fees in that and growing over 50% a year. So that's another example of all of these. In the past – just to clarify, in the past, we decided that in the operating segments, we were going to lift the costs in the product lines in the operating segments and that any part of the company could take the (53:38) from other product lines and create products and the revenues of those product lines are in the segment where if it's Index or Analytics. In this case, it happens that a lot of what we're trying to do is continued to 45 and enhanced and strengthen the already powerful Index franchise and a lot of what is happening is that the factor model work that we're doing in Analytics is benefiting immensely the factor indices and Index, the ESG work is benefiting that. We're actually – we're beginning to look at, we have – we list a whole new family of factor indices in fixed income. We're looking into – can we make fixed income factor indices out of that.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. And then my second question is just on Analytics. Is it fair to think of that as a 2018 story? Or is it going to take maybe a little bit longer than that? And any rough long-term targets for revenue growth in margins as in the upcoming years? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So on the latter, we continue to stick to our guns, which is we would like this product line to have EBITDA margins in the 30% to 35%, and revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Mid-to-high single-digits.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Mid-to-high single-digits. And we continue to be focused on that. And we clearly have done very well in getting us to those targets of profitability. And we have more work to do, and stronger work to do to get to the high-single-digits, mid-to-high single-digits in revenue growth. We all believe that it is feasible to achieve that because there is an inherent amount of demand for this in the complexity of portfolios, the efficiencies of investment processes, all the things that I've mentioned in the prepared remarks. We just got to position the product line to ride that wave in addition to the current wave that we're doing. And I don't know whether it would take a year or two, hard to say, but we clearly, as we develop more confidence as to the timeline, we'll be talking to all of you about it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. This is Patrick in for Toni. BlackRock's Aladdin platform seems to be gaining share in the Analytics space, and the management team at that firm has talked about aggressively growing the product suite. I'm wondering if you would attribute any of the deceleration you've seen in Analytics or the uptick in cancellations to an increase in the competitive intensity in that industry?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Not much, to be honest. When you look at the cancels that we have had, they have been – a lot of them have been cancels that a hedge fund shut down, and they've canceled the service, some of the wealth management cancels have been partial cancels, in which the cost-cutting pressure was such that even though there's part of what these tools do that is mission-critical, they just scaled back the ancillary services that we provided for example and the like. So we haven't seen that level of keen competition in all of these. I think that clearly, we are much more positioned into the area where the tools are adaptable to the client investment processes, a little bit of self-help, meaning they do a lot of things themselves. And what we're trying to do is capture the opportunity that they are capturing which is the one that I don't want the tools, I want somebody to do it for us, and that's where our solutions and services come in, more integrated platform of data and analytics and models and all of that.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yes, Patrick, we track the reasons for cancels very closely. And as Henry said, we are seeing the reasons particularly attributed to cost pressure, reductions across our clients, hedge fund shutdowns. So that's what we're seeing when we take a look at that.
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then can you remind us what you typically see when two clients merge, I guess, particularly, on the Index side, it seems like consolidation is coming up more often as a way for the industry to manage some top-line pressures. So I'm wondering what you typically see when two customers come together?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, first of all, we've been waiting for this consolidation for 20 years, right. So I think that it looks like it will accelerate. But trust me, I've been saying that for 20 years, and it hasn't happened, right. So we'll have to see if this time is different, right. Secondly is that, when there is consolidation, there are times in which you do lose a little bit of the Index subscription because one plus one is not two, and that merger is one and a half. But what happens is that this firm becomes bigger and more sophisticated and, therefore, they need more information in more places in order to manage their business. So it tends to be a wash, to be honest, in many instances. You may lose a little bit. You'll lose because you have a cancel. And then in a year or two later, the client sort of begins to subscribe to more things. So we are not as worried about that at this point with respect to Index. If there is more consolidation in Analytics and in active managers, we will get more impacted in Analytics, maybe a bit more. But, again, they have more complex processes. They want to have a better platform, sophisticated, to cut costs and all of that, and that's where we come in. So, again, it's a little bit of six of one, half a dozen of the other, right.
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for the color.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Henry, I wanted some of your thoughts on the integrated effort. What do you think are some of the bigger hurdles to growth, once you do get to, say, end of Phase 2? Is it going to be the incumbency of competitor solutions? Is it the missionary sale to new clients? Clearly, you folks have a lot of tailwinds that should grease the wheels, but I just wanted to think about the puts and takes looking a bit further out. Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So are you asking about the totality of the company or just 1 product line?
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Totality.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Look, in the totality of the company, I just want to reiterate, we're largely a content company. And when you look at the vast majority of our revenues and our valuation, and all of that it's about selling content. And the content is about investment problems and challenges and putting a model or a methodology and then turning that into data and into analytical algorithm for calculations and things like that. Now, so there is a lot of technology in producing that content, but we've mastered that very well. Now, all of that content needs to be enabled by very sophisticated content-enabling applications – workflow applications, if you want to call it that. And that has traditionally been the clients build their own or they use third-party services. And, increasingly, the clients don't want to build that because they're under a lot of cost pressure. They don't want to build that. So they're either relying on third-party applications or they want us to build those applications. So when you look at our niching of our growth is the smaller bet that we're placing on the company of pulling (62:07) those applications to enable that content and drive much higher levels of growth. Even in the Index product line, which is a product line that is largely sold as content, as data to be enabled by client applications or third-party applications, with factor indices, the clients are asking us, we got to have the analytical tools for them to understand what factors are driving those indices, and that's what we call index metrics. And we started with reports, then get sent on paper, then we automated a little bit, and now we need to put that into BarraOne because the client cannot (62:40) understand what's going on on those factor indices, with those analytical tools. So I think that is an area, we'll continue to do very well in content and the production of that content and that will be – continue to be a big part of the growth of the company. But I think we're looking for that incremental growth to be – to how do we put our content through all, every single type of application, whether it's client, or third-party or our own.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, I was wondering if you can share some thoughts around the chatter amongst your customers about a push to self-indexing. Any updated thoughts on how you're viewing that as an opportunity versus risk? Thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Look, that's what has been, it's a chatter. Look, we're always obsessed and paranoid about everything, that's how we built the company and continue to stay well. But it's not something we're losing sleep on. These are the – MSCI, in this position is very entrenched. It's part of our language, we're innovating all the time. There's an ecosystem built around our indices from active to passive to derivatives to over-the-counter products and all of that, very, very hard to make it into that.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thanks for your time.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Warren Gardiner with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you guys just dig in a bit more around the point you made about being able to reduce costs for the asset manager. I mean, have you guys executed on any examples in that yet, or is this really more just sort of the crocks of the solutions initiative you were talking about?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: No, no. We have a number of initiatives with clients that are looking to get out of building data sets, get out of building models, and get out of building technology. And actually, not to have all those people that are doing all of that. In some cases, the client has already fired those people and they're looking for us to help them. This is most prevalent right now in Europe, particularly in Continental Europe, that's an area that we're spending a great deal of time with those clients. And they are really at the leading edge of doing that, but it's definitely beginning to creep into the U.S. as well.
Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thanks. And then I guess just a quick one, you mentioned 13% growth in factor-based run rate, I think, for the quarter. Does that include ETFs? Or is it just the subscription side?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: No, it includes everything. Subscription – remember, this is not just indices, also includes factor models, equity factor models, equity factor models did very well, what we call equity analytics, it's very well within the Analytics segment this past quarter. So it's across every tool that is used to invest along equity factor basis.
Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys just revisit your – the thought process regarding share repurchases. Obviously, the share repurchases in the quarter were made out of a type loss planked in the quarter and the shares appreciated quite a bit there. But in terms of the overall free cash flow, at what price point you guys buy those shares? Give us a guidance, discuss what your thought processes to that?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes, so look, I think it's highly predicated on volatility of the stock. The more volatility on the stock, the more we buy shares. So it's not – there is clearly an overlay of evaluation and levels and all of that, but we believe that there has been volatility in the stock in prior quarters. And we want to mark up the truck and load it up when there is that. Unfortunately, this past quarter, there was not a lot of volatility. Obviously, look we're a risk company, we look at volatility all over the world and that's what we sell in our risk models. And volatility in all equity markets around the world has been extremely muted, right, as we know. So that has been the case with our stock also, and that has prevented us from buying. To the extent that there will be volatility in the future, we'll continue that strategy. If it happens a lot, we'll have to change and modify the strategy. But right now, we continue to believe that that's what we want to do. And therefore, we will buy a lot more when prices are low and a lot less when prices are high, right. It's not a thoroughly a fundamental view on the valuation of the company is that we like to take advantage of volatility.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: It is based on the amount of free cash flow you have in any given period as kind of the baseline of where you go from there? Is that where you start?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yes, well, we start there, being if you have no cash, then it's academic, right? And – but look, we didn't have the huge amount of cash that we used to have. We still have a meaningful amount of excess cash, somewhere around $350 million, $400 million would be the – when you exclude the international cash and cash flow operation and working capital and all of that. So look, if there were a lot of volatility, we would've blown out through all that cash, so that's – our goal is to carry as legal exit cash as possible, but to ensure that we do it in the proper way.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Just one quick question for me. So as we think about your ESG business, obviously, that's an area that it seems like a lot of companies and competitors are trying to get into. So as you think about yours, certainly, the growth rate is really nice, but how do you defend that growth? How do you defend that market share? What sort of structural advantages do you guys have that are sustainable?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Well, you've got to first understand that a lot of people are getting into the thing, into the data side. Just producing data and giving data to customers, and some of the big players, big financial information companies, that's what they do, that's not where we are. I mean, where we are is in the ESG business to enable investment decisions by client. So at the front end, a portfolio manager making a decision, an equity analyst making a decision, a fixed income manager making a decision as to think about if somebody wanted to buy $100 million worth of MSCI share, and they look at all the financials, and they look at ESG and they say, I like the rating of $450 million. Or I don't like the rating of $250 million, right, that's overweighting or underweighting whatever they will do. That's exactly where we are. And to do that, we do ESG ratings, for sure. And we, obviously, will increasingly do ESG indices so that their underlying basis for portfolios and things like that. That is in the sweet spot what we do. So we have all these relationship with all these asset managers. We have great trust by them and we – they consult with us as to which is the best way to integrate this. And as a result, they buy the service and then they say, well, I need to have a benchmark my portfolio that is actively managed or I need a passive management approach. It's a sweet spot. So that has a huge bulk and a big competitive advantage for us.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stephen Davidson for closing remarks.
Stephen C. Davidson - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, all, for your time, and have a great afternoon.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Sonia. Good day and welcome to the MSCI fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they were made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find a reconciliation of the equivalent GAAP measure in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 24 to 28 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thanks Steve and good day to everyone. As you have seen from the newswire this morning, we’ve been very busy and there is a lot to be excited about at MSCI. We are pleased share with you our fourth quarter and full year financial results. We executed very well against our strategy and we continue to create new growth and services design to help our clients solve their most challenging investments problems and capitalize on their significant investment opportunities. As a result, MSCI is even more embedded in the fabric of the global investment process therefore creating a valuable network effect with our clients. Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our financial results for full year 2016. A 31% increase in adjusted EPS was driven by a 7% increase in operating revenue, a 2% decrease in adjusted EBITDA costs, an 18% increase in adjusted EBITDA, a lower effective tax rate, and a 12% decrease in our share count. We have been to achieve these - strong results because the management team has been keenly focused on three areas as we have been reporting to you each quarter. We’re focused on investing in new products and services to drive our top line growth is driving from greater efficiency and productivity gains to create an even more efficient organization and ensuring the capital at MSCI is right sized and optimally deployed in the highest return opportunities to enhance shareholder returns. First, in terms of revenue growth, we’re recorded a 7% increase in revenue driven principally by a 10% growth in Index revenue. Excluding the foreign exchange impact on subscription revenues, operating revenues would have been 8% higher. As we say would have been an increase of 8%. This was a 12 consecutive quarter of year-over-year double digit growth in our Index subscription run rate which is a best demand to the strength of our Index franchise as well as the strong contribution from innovative new products. Analytics revenue grew 3% on a reported basis or 5% on an FX adjusted basis. While 5% constant current revenue growth in Analytics in a challenging market environment is a solid performance, we are not satisfied with this growth rate and continue to take measures to improve it. We have successfully restructured the Analytics product line on the Peter’s and Gary’s leadership and now it is well positioned for the next phase which we hope will lead to increasing levels of revenue growth in line with our long term targets for this product line. As announced earlier this morning, we’re very excited that Peter will be replacing Remy Briand as Global Head of Research and Product Development. As we will discuss in just a moment, this role is one of the most important ones at MSCI and it’s even more important now given our drive to accelerate the pace of innovation and growth. Peter will be succeeded in his role as Head of Analytics by Jorge Mina, who has led Analytics in the Americas and has also led the business side of the development of our new Analytics platform. This move is just another example of our ability to tap a very deep bench of talent and deploy it to critical areas of focus at MSCI. Revenue from our Other Product segment grew 7% on a reported basis or 13% excluding the impact of FX. ESG continues to register strong top line growth of approximately 20% on record sales in the quarter and record sales for the full year. The success in this product line has been driven by the increase in integration of ESG factors into the mainstream of the investment process, resulting in a strong sales and leveraging MSCI’s existing client base as well as some new clients. This strong ESG sales mainly to existing MSCI plan demonstrate the power of the MSCI franchise with our clients as we are leveraging our brand and our existing relationships to sell ESG Reserves and Ratings at an accelerated pace. In Real Estate, we realize our commitment to achieve profitability driven largely by discipline expense management. Real Estate is one of the largest and fastest growing asset classes in the world. So we believe that the restructuring of this product line that is underway will begin to pay dividend in the near future for us. In summary, in the overall area of revenue growth, we are very focused on innovation and new products and services to accelerate the top line. Turning to operational efficiency, the strong top line numbers we’re complemented by a 2% decrease in adjusted EBITDA expenses was flat versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis. We’re able to achieve this strong performance because of our continued session with efficiency and our focus on redirecting capital to high return with initial investment. We expect to see more improvements overtime in our operating tax rate, primarily driven by ongoing efforts to better outline our tax profile with our overall global operating footprint. We believe there are more opportunities to achieve operating efficiencies at MSCI and we are only just getting started. Some of the areas that we are focused on include increased automation within our technology infrastructure, improved distribution of our products and services through our applications and that will allow our clients to a better access to our products which will result in operational efficiencies but would also result in higher growth of revenue. Finally, in terms of capital optimization, we continue to be strategic investors in our stock, repurchasing 11.1 million shares for a total of approximately $844 million at an average price of about $74.18 throughout 2016 and through January 2017. We have delivered in our commitment to optimize our balance sheet by increasing our gross leverage to levels that allow us to enhance shareholder returns but also maintain flexibility to pursue all our capital deployment options as our management onboard determined. In summary, 2016 was a very strong year for MSCI. And we are very excited by the opportunities for growth and further efficiencies that lie ahead. In 2017, we will continue to be extremely focused on innovation and how we can accelerate the growth of the company. We will continue to be positioned - positioning ourselves to achieve superior operational efficiencies and again we will be focused on optimizing the deployment of capital, not just through dividends and share repurchases, but also across all capital deployment opportunities that will enhance our shareholder returns. Please turn to Slide 5, which illustrates what we call the integrated franchise at MSCI that we bring to clients to help them capitalize under significant investment opportunities and so their most challenging investment problems. This franchise is the basis and a foundation for a partnership like relationship with our clients as oppose to a vendor like relationship. We are very pleased of the investment community has embraced our segment reporting that we released in 2015. He has provided our investors and the analysts that follow us with a transparency they needed to give them the ability to track profitability and better value our asset. But it is absolutely critical to understand that MSCI is increasingly one integrated company. This integration is evident across several areas, including out approach to client relationships i.e. our go-to-market strategy, our product development efforts between various areas of the product line and the continent application combination the power the tools that we provide our clients. Let me talk through each one of those areas briefly. First, in terms client relationships, we are taking an integrated approach by having a dedicated account manager for each of our top 100 clients. Each manager is responsible for core of the meeting or client interactions within MSCI. These account managers are focused on understanding our clients’ strategy, the various initiatives our clients have to drive those strategies and move the key individuals in the senior management team of our client they are responsible for this strategies, so that we can help them address those opportunities and those challenges that they have in their investment processes. So in addition to the relationship that we have with those clients at the expert or user or product level, this overlay of the relationship allows us to apply a solutions approach that drive the interaction with us at a senior level between MSCI and decline organization, so that we become a partner in what the client goes and not just a vendor to the various experts in the organization. Next MSCI is increasingly integrated at the product development level, where we use all of our different IP across the company to the lever complex solutions to our clients. Let me give you a few examples, just a few, there are many more, just a few. For example in equity factor models and equity factors indexes which are critical collaborations between two product lines. We’ve talked about this extensively in the past. ESG Research and Rating and ESG Indexes provide our clients with an integrated perspective on the equity market opportunity with a view that cuts across market cap, factor weight and ESG factors. So you get all these three combined, the market cap approach to indexes, you get the factor approach to the opportunity set and then you get the ESG factor approach in order to give our clients one view of the equity markets in which they can build their portfolios and it becomes very powerful in their search for alpha and differentiation. Lastly in our Analytics product line, we have integrated our equity risk management products and services with our multi-asset class risk products and services and we are now in a further developing our fixed income risk products into one holistic view of risk of the total portfolio equity, fixed income and other asset classes and from the portfolio management part and the risk management approach in a holistic way. The third area of integration with MSCI is between what we call content and applications are further illustrated in this slide. The most successful firms in our state will be those that master the integration of both the content i.e. the models and the methodologies and the right data, the algorithms or calculators, the content that we provide with the applications that are so critical and enabling that content for the maximum use and utility in investment processes of our clients. The combination of content and application creates more value than some of the parts, because of the ability of using content and applications combined to address more use case and solve more problems and create more opportunities for our clients. So our goal is to be the best provider of content through either our clients’ applications, third party applications or our own applications, all of it as long as we get paid on their content. So we are working on this integration as shows by our new Analytics platform which integrates data, analytical content and models and algorithms all in one platform. The integrated franchise that we're building at MSCI is very powerful. It get some ways to go, there are long areas that we can continue to further integrate, but we believe that we're just getting started under the opportunity is massive. As I travel around the world with seen our clients especially at the C-level, I hear more and more that they want those to do much more for them that they want us to become a partner to them in their investment process not just the vendor and therefore we can solve more and more use cases with our tools. So we believe that this integrated solutions based approach in addition to what we have built on the user level will serve our client very well and will drive substantial value creation for our clients and our shareholders for a long time to come. Before I turn the call over to Kathleen to go through the quarterly numbers and I would like to welcome Jacques Perold our new Independent Member of the Board, who will officially start with us on March 6, regional press release and an 8-K earlier this morning and we are absolutely thrilled to have someone of Jack’s deep experience in the asset management industry to join MSCI at this exciting time in the evolution of our firm. Kathleen?
Kathleen Winters: Thanks Henry, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll start on Slide 6 will take you through our fourth quarter results. We closed up the year with the very strong Q4. We delivered a 7% increase in revenue driven primarily by a 6% increase in recurring subscription revenue and an 11% increase in asset-based fee revenue. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on subscription revenues, total operating revenue would have been increased 8%. As a reminder, we do not provide the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our asset-based fee tied to average AUM of which approximately two thirds are invested in securities, denominators and currencies other than U.S. dollar. On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 1% and adjusted EBITDA expenses were basically flat. Expenses that are supposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations represented about 40% of adjusted EBITDA expenses in Q4 and the full year 2016. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 3.5% and 2.7% respectively. The primary currency move that drove this benefit with the British pound, which was substantially weaker year-over-year. We delivered a 17% increase in operating income and a 16% increase in adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.2%. Our effective tax rate was 29.7% in line with the 29.8% effective tax rate in prior year Q4. The 2015 fourth quarter tax rate benefited primarily from higher net tax benefits mainly associated with various research and production related credits and deductions. These benefits impacted Q4 2015 adjusted EPS by $0.04. The current quarter's tax rate benefited from higher 2016 profits recorded in lower tax jurisdictions than previously estimated, as well as several favorable discrete items including the settlement of tax audit and a recent taxable change. These benefits increased fourth quarter 2016 of adjusted EPS by $0.04 per share. Diluted EPS and adjusted EPS increased 28% and 23% respectively. Free cash flow increased over 100% to $127 million in fourth quarter 2016. In summary, Q4 with a great performance capital of a strong year, as we continue to execute very well against our strategy. On Slide 7, you can see the different drivers of EPS growth in Q4. Adjusted EPS increased 23% from $0.66 per share to $0.81 per share. Strong revenue growth from both subscription and asset-based fees contributed $0.15 per share. Investments net of efficiencies in our product segments and operations we used earnings by $0.04. In terms of capital optimization, share repurchases benefit EPS as well. We reduced our average weighted diluted share count by 9% which benefited adjusted EPS by $0.08 with a partial offset from higher net interest expense to net $0.03 per share benefit. And lastly, FX had a net $0.01 per share positive impact due to the impact of currency moves primarily the pound on adjusted EBITDA expenses. On Slide 8, we highlight our record fourth quarter sales. We delivered record sales this quarter despite the continuing challenging market headwinds that select client segment have been experiencing as reflected in the higher level of cancels and Analytics over the past three quarters, which I will address in an upcoming slide. The record growth sales of $50 million represents an increase of 21% and was driven by strong growth across all regions and product segments with particular strength in Asia with growth sales were up 45%. The growth in Asia was driven by a broad mix of new client acquisition and module of sales in Index as well as strong growth in Analytics especially in Greater China and Japan. We believe that this strong sales performance in a challenging market is a reflection of our ability to identify new and innovative used cases that leverage our product and service offerings for our clients. Strong recurring index sales up 26% were complemented by strong Analytics recurring sales which were up 13% driven by strength in the banking client segment and higher sales of RiskManager and Equity Model. We also had record ESG sales with recurring sales up 54%, driven primarily by ESG Ratings sales leveraging both MSCI existing client base as well new client growth. These record sales help to offset higher levels of cancels resulting in a 37% increase in net new recurring subscriptions. We’re maintaining a high level of retention at approximately 93% on a much larger book of business. Our pipeline remains strong and we remain optimistic, but cautious as we move into 2017. On Slide 9 through 2014, I’ll walk you through our segment results. Let’s begin with the Index segment on Slide 9 through Slide 11. Revenues for Index increased 11% on a reported basis, driven primarily by a 9% increase in recurring subscriptions. We saw growth in benchmark and data products broadly with growth in core products, factor and thematic products, usage fees and custom products. Additionally, we saw a 1% increase in asset-based fee revenue. In terms of our operating metrics, record quarterly sales were driven by record recurring subscription sales of $17 million. Aggregate retention rate remained high and partially 93% in the quarter and 95% from the full year in line with the prior year period. Index run rate grew by $54 million or 9% compared to December 31st, 2015. This was driven by an increase and subscription run rate of $38 million or 10% and $16 million or 8% increase in asset-based fee run rate. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Index was 71.1% versus 68.9% in Q4 2015. Turning to Slide 10, detail on our asset-based fee. Starting with the upper left hand chart, overall asset-based fee revenue increased $6 million or 11%, driven by a $3 million or 26% increase in revenue from non-ETF passive funds and $2 million or 5% increase in revenue from ETF linked to MSCI indexes, I mean a 11% increase in average AUM. The strong revenue generation from non-ETF passive funds was primarily driven by higher revenue from new product launches including increases in higher fee products. In the upper right hand chart, we ended the fourth quarter with $481 billion in ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes, driven by cash inflows of $15 billion, partially offset by market depreciation of $9 billion. For the full year, ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes increased $48 billion or 11% on inflows of $37 billion and market appreciation of $11. From January 1st, 2017 through January 31st, 201, ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes has increased to $509 billion, driven by $13 billion in inflows and $15 billion in market depreciation. We hit an all-time high of $511 billion on the 27th January. More equity ETF track MSCI indexes than any other provider. As shown in the lower left hand chart, quarter end AUM by market exposure ETF linked to MSCI indexes reflected the decline in EM after the U.S. Presidential Election, which was accompanied by increases in developed market. EM however remains well above prior year levels. Lastly, on the lower right hand chart, you can see the year-over-year decline in the average run rate basis point fee from 3.32 to 3.1. The decline in the average basis point fee is primarily due to cash flow statement lower fee segments of the ETF market. However, we’ve experienced a stabilization of the average basis point fee over the last three quarters and it has continued through January 2017. On Slide 11, we provide you with the AUM of ETF linked through our indexes classified in three discrete components illustrating our differentiated index licensing strategy. This strategy is linked to further expand our index licensing franchise for the ETF market beyond our flagship indexes increasing the adoption of new index family and U.S. segment index families. The first component of the strategy primarily reflects the licensing to ETF provider of our flagship indexes. In other words, market cap indexes focused mainly on exposures outside of the U.S. with exposure to large and midcap stocks only. This component represents the majority of ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes. As well as most of the approximately 10 trillion benchmark to MSCI indexes overall. This category of licensing we include EAFE, EM and our single-country market cap indexes. The ETF AUM linked to these indexes has been growing at a three year CAGR of approximately 6% and pricing have been steady. The next component of our strategy is the licensing of indexes which primarily include non-U.S. exposure to large, mid and small cap stock, which include indexes that are used as a basis of the U.S. listed iShares or core series in the USA factor indexes such as the MSCI, USA minimum volatility index. The assets in this component represent roughly 10% of total AUM and have been growing at a CAGR of over 90% over the last three years. Generally, the pricing for these products is lower than ETF that licensed our flagship indexes. The third component of our strategy is a licensing of more segmented U.S. indexes including sector and REAT indexes. AUM has been growing at a CAGR of approximately 30% over the past three years and represents about 15% of overall AUM. The pricing in this component is generally lower than ETF licensed or flagship in new index family. So you can see our strategy is to diversify our licensed ETF franchise in maximized revenue. This differentiates strategy has been successful as evidenced by the strong growth in AUM and revenue. Even now the faster growth in the lower fee product areas has contributed to a lower overall average basis point fee based on run rate. While, we expect our periods were product mix will impact the average fee we earn through a differentiated licensing strategy, we look to maximize the price volume trade-off over the long term. Resilient pricing in our flagship bonds with strong AUM growth but more than offset pricing declined and fast growing lower fee ETF. On Slide 12, we highlight the financials for the Analytics segment. Revenues for Analytics increased 3.4% to $114 million on a reported basis, which includes $2.4 million negative impact from FX. Excluding the impacted FX, Analytics revenue increase 5.6%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher revenues from RiskManager, Equity Models and BarraOne. We have a strong increase in recurring sales which were 13% higher compared to the prior year fourth quarter, due to higher equity model and RiskManager sales. Gross sales which include non-recurring sales were up $2.9 million or 15.1%. We did however see elevated cancels in Q4, due to seasonality driven by a higher number of contracts up for renewal in the fourth quarter as well as continued challenging market conditions in some client segments. Analytics run rate at December 31st, 2016 grew by $15 million or 3% to $452 million and would have increased 4% excluding the impact of FX. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.1%, up from 27.9% in the prior year, notably approaching our long term margin target range for this segment. Turning to Slide 13, this provides you with sales and cancels history for the Analytics segment. The chart shows gross sales and cancels for Analytics over the last three years. The higher level sales in 2016 broke us out of the $60 million range of the previous two years, driven by strong RiskManager and Equity Model sales. Over the past several quarters, we’ve seen hiking cost pressures and budgetary constraints among our bank and bank-owned asset and wealth management clients which resulted in a $10 million or 34% increase in cancels for Analytics in 2016. Roughly $5 million of the $10 million increase came from 2 clients in the second half of the year. These cancels have been primarily in the U.S. but we’ve also experienced higher levels in Europe principally in a RiskManager product area. Approximately 70% of the cancels for 2016 are principally related to closures, changes in strategy and cost pressures. So market factor is beyond our control. So while we’re disappointed with the increase in cancels and selected clients segments, we’re very pleased with our strong sales numbers in the quarter, specifically in the bank segment where RiskManager growth those were up 138% and the pipeline remains strong. Turning to Slide 14, we show results for the All Other segment. Revenues for all other increased 4% to $19 million reported basis and grew 15% after adjusting the disposal of Occupiers and the impact of FX. First, in terms of ESG, a $2 million or 20% increase in ESG revenue to $12 million due to strong ESG rating revenue with record ESG recurring sales in the quarter which increase 54%. Growth in ESG continues to be driven by the increasing integration of ESG in to the mainstream of the investment partner and leveraging the existing MSCI client base as well as new client acquisitions. Real Estate revenues decreased $1 million or 13% to $8 million on a reported basis. Excluding any impact of foreign currency and sale of Occupiers business, Real Estate revenues increased 10%. The All Other adjusted EBITDA margin was 2.3% up from a negative 16.1% in the prior year. The increase in the adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by continued strong growth in ESG revenue as well as lower Real Estate costs, primary due to a reduction in headcount and strong cost management as we make progress towards improved profitability in our Real Estate product area. Turning to Slide 15, you have an update on our capital return activity. We continue to return substantial amount of capital to investors. In Q4 and through January 27th, we repurchased and settled total of 4.2 million shares at an average price of $80.27 for a total value of $339.7 million. Since 2012, we’ve returned almost 2.3 billion for shares repurchase and dividends and we’ve repurchased 35 million shares for the company. There was an $806 million remaining on our outstanding repurchase authorization as of January 27th, 2017. On Slide 16, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $792 million. This includes a $208 million of cash held outside the United States and domestic cash cushion of approximately $125 million to $150 million which is a general policy we maintained for operational purposes. We continue to repurchase shares in January and above over $60 million. Furthermore, we pay our annual cash incentive compensation in the first quarter. As a result of this coupled with interests, dividends and tax payments, CapEx disbursement and the aforementioned buyback, our deployable cash balance in Q1 2017 will be lower than what was available as to 12-31-16. Our growth leverage was 3.7 times at the end of the quarter down from 3.8 times at the end of the third quarter 2016. Over time we expect that we will return to our stated range of three to and three and half times as our adjusted EBITDA growth. On Slide 17, we highlight the key drivers of the outperformance for the full year 2016 free cash flow generation. Free cash flow increased 53% to $392 million for the full year versus 2015. The outperformance was driven primarily by two factors. First, we saw strong customer collections in Q4 with some clients even paying early therefore, we experienced a pull forward of about $20 million in collection into 2016. Next, we benefited from a combination of tax refund and discrete cash tax benefits of about $40 million. Normalized free cash flow would have been approximately $330 million for the full year 2016. For 2017, we are guiding to free cash flow of $310 million to $370 million reflecting ongoing strong cash generation in 2016 partially offset by incremental interest payments, cash taxes and lower collections due to the full power. Lastly, before we open the line for Q&A, on Slide 18, we’re providing you with our full year 2017 guidance. Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $690 million to $705 million. And adjusted EBITDA expenses are expected to come in between $605 million and $620. FX part rates at the end of 2016 are the bases for this expense guidance. In 2017, we're expecting at roughly half of the $32 million year-over-year increase. And adjusted EBITDA expenses will be from carryover and inflationary increases. The other half of the increased will be investments in the sales, marketing and products and services. We expect the full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA margin in analytics to be flat or slightly better than the 4Q exit margin for the product area. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $116 million. Net cash provided by operating activities is expected in the range of $360 million to $410 million. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million in line with 2016. Free cash flow is expected to come in between $310 million and $370 million below the free cash flow generated this year because of the items I discussed earlier. Effective tax rate is expected to come in between 31.5% and 32.5%. In the first quarter of 2017, we were adopting the new accounting guidance related to employee share based compensation under the new standard, all share compensation excess tax benefits and tax short falls will be recognized in income taxes in the statement of income as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. Previously they were recognized as a component of stockholders equity. We expect the impact assuming current stock price levels and based on the stock investing and option expiration timetables to result in a tax benefit of approximately $3.5 million for the full year of 2017. Given that the majority of our stocks were the best in the first quarter of each year, we expect about two thirds of this estimate to occur in the first quarter. Please note the impact of this change is just an estimate which could change significantly based on changes in MSCI’s stock price, employees and when employees elect to exercise options. We're reaffirming our dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40% of adjusted EPS and are objective to maintain growth leverage in the range of three to three and half time. Also beginning with Q1 2017, adjusted EPS will include amortization expense associated with internally developed capitalized software on a perspective basis. The impact of prior periods was not material. We're making this change because internally developed capitalized software will become a more meaningful component over time as we continue to invest. We believe that only intangible amortization related to acquisitions to be excluded from the adjusted EPS calculation. For modeling purposes amortization of internally developed capitalized software that will be included in adjusted EPS is expected to be between $5 million and $6 million in 2016. Lastly, as a follow-up to the issuance of our long term targets in 2015, we are reaffirming those targets as of this call. In summary, we executed well throughout the quarter and the year, and we're very pleased with our strong results. We are continuing to invest in and innovate with new products that will position MSCI to continue to grow in the quarters and years ahead. With that we’ll open the lines to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm: Hey, good morning everyone. Maybe just starting with the environment and the outlook a little bit clearly that cancels are still elevated in the year, but the sales were really, really strong. So what are you seeing out there, I guess particularly on holiday to maybe to some degree on index in terms of confidence level that the sales can remain elevate or increase, so what are you seeing out there, we also while also selling I mean and the cancellation side do you feel like a lot of the kind a one time or such done now or when you look at the customer base there are there still some areas that you think should be struggling so we might continue to see some of these elevated levels? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Yes, so the pipeline remains pretty solid going to 2017 and in January. So that we remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects of gross sales, and return sales this year. I think the environment I mean we have obviously very strong financial result despite the - our end client environment, we sell quite a lot to active managers you know around the world that's a lot of our subscription business is based on that clearly asset based fee business that based on passive managers. And that you know client base the active management client base is suffering from two areas, cyclical pressures, the value stop thinking is last when you have you know sort of asset prices being determine by monetary policy around the world. And you have secular issues such as you know passive management of grudging a lot in what they do. So throughout the year all the way through to December those trends have continues to the extent that the new environment that we're seeing of higher growth around the world the U.S. or Europe or Asia more emphasis on deficit spending or system policy rather than the monetary policy, higher inflation. So our end client base can benefit from that and the prospects will get better than what we are currently seeing. Too early to tell at this moment clearly there was a big run up of banks and asset managers, and insurance companies, and the like from November to December someone that some of it has been reversed in January. But again it's too early to tell, we tried not to count on that or focus on that, but we try to do is we extremely focused on understanding the client or what the client is facing positively or negatively and try to help them with that. So with respect to cancel, I think it's hard to say, clearly we have high sales, because of all the efforts we’re doing and the new product and the newer services, the new approach to go to market, the solutions that we're trying to come to our clients with it, all of that has benefited the gross sales. I think they will continue to be some level of evaluated cancels given the structural changes that are going on maybe they get a little lower because of less pressure on the cyclical changes but again is too early to tell. And therefore the conclusion from our part is the pipeline where executing well against that, we hope to continue our piece and pace of sales but again I don’t know it will do every quarter with the last quarter. We are assuming that the cancels will continue to be elevated at some level given the environment on as an environment turns.
Alex Kramm: Very helpful, thank you. And then just I need to address of course the asset-based tied in terms of ETF fees and other index fees I mean thanks for the color in terms of the mix. But obviously when you think about your biggest customer BlackRock, you saw some of the moves that they just made on the custody side moving $1 trillion over to it to J.P. Morgan from State Street and I think in the process they also said that they are getting more conscious with some of their vendors. So when you combine that and you see other moves like swap for example lowering fees aggressively for their index products even on the index mutual fund side like it just seems like the fee pressure is still out there. So any updated thoughts on how that how you fit in and if there could be anything coming out if your discussed that change with some of the customers of yourself? Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: I think the first think that we are trying to do best that we could to provide you kind of an insight look of how we view our licensing strategy and done with the comments by Kathleen. The flagship, product line, the new index families they were launching that of course have less value at the moment than the flagship one that are been around for about 20, 30 years and then the domestic one U.S. domestic one that have a fairly different competitive dynamics than the prior tool right. So a lot of what we’re going in is like we know we just want to rest on the flagship product line and the wonderful things that we’ve done there, we want to continue to expand dramatically into all areas of the ETF marketplace regardless of the competitive dynamics good or bad as long as we - is a good return on our capital and on the effort. So that’s what we trying to simplify here in as good of a way as we could. I think that the BlackRock is an example of that on the partnership approach that we take in with our largest client and which we together trying to optimize the revenue for them and consequently the revenue to us, was in the same way, we do it with a lot of other clients on the active side and on the passive side, I suppose to just being a vendor and just being the lowest cause vendor to them. So we believe that there are segments of the market like flagship indexes that will have less cost pressure or less pressure, because there is unique IP there, and unique properties. But there are other segments of the market that we have more fee pressure. And I’m not afraid of going into them towards, it’s not a question of fees, the question already return on our capital, return on our efforts. And we have great returns and all built upon already low cost, marginal low very low marginal costs infrastructure, we are going to be in all those places.
Kathleen Winters: So you’re look at the space, going to continue to grow and gather substantial net of assets overtime right. And we’re focused on how we capture that market share through new product innovation and our differentiated licensing strategy. Over the long term, we’re pretty confident that the volume price trade-off makes sense for us.
Alex Kramm: All right. Very good. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
William Warmington: Good morning, everyone.
Henry Fernandez: Good morning.
Kathleen Winters: Good morning.
William Warmington: So a question for you also on the Analytic side that’s an area where you guys have been putting through some price increases and so even though you had elevated attrition there, margins were still up 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis and even 30 basis points on a sequential basis. So was it just that some low margin clients left or are you taking more of up and out up or out I should say for some of the more marginal clients?
Henry Fernandez: No, no. I think overall Bill, the approach has been how do we take a very aggressive and proactive management of the product line or no last picks of it, or last pick. So we started by saying what is the value of this products to our clients and how does that value compared to the price. They were charging and we - so and realize that some of these flow coming credible value. Clients are running their entire infrastructure in many cases on this and therefore dividing immense value and the price they were paying was lower. So we said okay, you know overtime, we got to try to equate value and price on that. So that you know the genesis of the price increases and things like that right. The price increases have not driving the cancellation by any meaningful or way at all.
William Warmington: Got it.
Henry Fernandez: So that they know sounds one approach. The second approach is that we look at all of our activities, so Analytics is composed to a lot of different activities and a lot of different products, insight that we say what, how much capital, how much and expenses or capital will be flowing to one area versus another area versus another area and we started cutting back significantly the effort on the capital in some area in order to deployed into higher yielding opportunities and alike. So that yield is a significant kind of demand of savings and we’ve put a lot of that in the margins. But reportedly very specifically a meaningful part of the savings are being deployed on our on what I mentioned briefly our efforts on fixed income analytics, fixing income risk and fixed income analytics and we’ve been able to sell fund. That significant effort last year and in the coming years out of that and it’s still be on our way to achieve those targets. So if you were to think about it, it’s almost like management one-on-one right. Understand your value proposition and the price that you are charging and what clients are you doing it and understand your how you deploying your people internally and what activities and what cost and we’re very pleased with what we’ve done, but we believe we also believe in recognize that we have we still have a long way go to yield even better financial results. And as we said, couple of years ago, when we launched this whole program of restructuring and reengineering and transformation of analytics, we knew that the first half of the program was going to be margin expansion and the second half has to be revenue growth and that’s what we’re focused on, on the revenue growth.
William Warmington: One more if am I might on leverage you pointed out the on Slide 16, the gross leverage at 3.7 times which is you know - sorry above the targeted at 3, 3.5, but really what stands out is the net leverage at 2.3 times which would tend to bring in the comment there you’ve got a fortress balance way overcapitalized, a high class problem of course. But are you thinking - you’ve got a lot of cash there, so are you thinking about doing some M&A or you are going to be more aggressive on the buyback?
Henry Fernandez: So I think the way to think about it is clearly the excess capital or excess cash and if the growth numbers look big and all of that but when you take the money that is outside of the U.S. which you can bring it unless there is some tax.
Kathleen Winters: Unless there is tax reformers opportunities.
Henry Fernandez: Plus $200 million that is kind of locked away right. And then the money that in the U.S. 500 plus million and you got to have operating cash to run in the business so that roughly at the moment gives you 400 plus or so million in that and we haven't yet paid the cash and the dividend payment this quarter and tax interest payments and all of that. So we are - we're getting close to kind of steady state in which we're setting up the excess capital and excess cash. And as we do we will continue in the same path of what we've done in next two, three years, mostly organic growth and mostly sort of return of capital for dividend and buyback with then occasionally acquisition here and there. But the less excess cash on your balance, it makes you to be even more opportunistic and discriminating on the purchase of your shares. So we’ll continue to it, but in this far way.
William Warmington: Well, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni Kaplan: Hi good morning.
Henry Fernandez: Good morning.
Kathleen Winters: Good morning.
Toni Kaplan: You mentioned some cash collections that were expected in fiscal 2017 that were received in the fourth quarter and so I was wondering if that dynamic impacted your new sales level during the quarter as well?
Kathleen Winters: Well, you know if you look at those two events are data points and look we had strong sales in the quarter, we’re very happy with that. Actually in the second half of the year sales were quite strong. And then we had the really healthy cash collections which is an interesting thing to see, you don’t often you see that where clients are actually paying ahead of the due date. So optimistically like to think that okay the environment looks pretty healthy, right clients have incremental cash are paying early but yet still we look at the overall environment, we look at some of our client segments that have been challenged over the last several quarters. So we're still a little bit cautious, but yes you're point too good data points there.
Toni Kaplan: Okay. And you've mentioned a couple of times the tax initiatives this year that will impact next year's tax rate by about 200 basis points by sort of positioning your business mark globally from a tax perspective. And so would potential tax reform in the United States if there were to be a reduction to a federal level of call it 20% would that impact your strategy or what you would do going forward for achieving your tax initiatives?
Kathleen Winters: Yeah, well, so first of all there are a lot of unknowns with regard to tax reforms in terms of what it looks like, when it takes place, when in effective. So we're waiting to see how that plays out, we’re watching that very closely. You know it depends on what form it takes right. Reduced corporate tax rate obviously would be beneficial, but then there are other considerations to an unknown like what happens with interest deductibility. So we're watching to see how that plays out, but generally the work we've done on the tax side really just aligned our tax structure with our operating structure, so where we employ our people, where we're generating our assets, where our clients are located. So all of that makes sense and we're waiting to see what any incremental changes might be with tax reform.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Mike Read: Hi guys this is Mike Read on for Joe, thanks for taking my question. Just could you go into a little bit what do you think other impacts from the new administration could be outside of possible tax reform that you might expect to see?
Henry Fernandez: I think the more the bigger one for us were obvious one would be to the - what I said before to the extent that there is higher growth in the U.S. may potentially be higher growth we're seeing the higher growth in Europe in the last few days, few weeks. More emphasis on fiscal policy rather than monetary policy there are more inflation all of that will be very beneficial to our client base, asset managers, hedge managers, banks, wealth managers, et cetera, and that will have two effects, they will buy more products from us, they wanted to buy, but the budgets are being constrained and then maybe less you know less slashing and burning cost basis. You can see that our major weakness, not major weakness, but a relative weakness in our - when you look at our councils has been the bank on asset managers, especially in Europe it bank on wealth managers. Even the bank balance sheet themselves well in the last quarter but in general the banks have been clearly slashing and burning expenses. So to the extent they feel better about trading to expand the asset managers feel better about flows and feel better about stop thinking and all of that that can potentially have a very leverage of bull effect on us, because we are right there, we’re the partners, we're helping them in a lot of things so you may have a two side of benefit, higher sales and lower councils and that will be highly leverage for us. But it is too early to tell, because that may be cope with your political risk or trade risk and things so that. So we’re cautiously optimistic, but we have to wait and see how it all being travel.
Mike Read: Okay, thanks. And then just switching over to the margin side after the strong expense in the last few years in the overall company even a margin kind of runway and do you see left in the medium and longer term for overall company margins?
Henry Fernandez: Well I mean we continue with the same policies that we have outlined so far, so very slow change from that.
Mike Read: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum: Good morning guys, thanks for taking my call. Just want to clarify on the tax rate guidance, 31.5% to 32.5% that includes the stock base compensation change in the first quarter?
Kathleen Winters: Yes, Keith it does include that.
Keith Housum: Okay and I think also just a follow-up question that in terms of the cash collections. I guess how to understand the logic about why would customers pay early because obviously people like to further hold their cash and then obviously they pay for it to do it otherwise, so why people pay early here in the fourth quarter?
Kathleen Winters: That's a really good question.
Henry Fernandez: We don’t know.
Kathleen Winters: We asked ourselves that question that we were happy to take the $20 million.
Keith Housum: Well if this guy came to you and said they can fairly.
Kathleen Winters: They send it to us.
Keith Housum: All right, thanks. Appreciated.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Warren Gardiner of Evercore. Your line is now open.
Warren Gardiner: Yes, thanks. I actually just on our last question to, so was that - did it impact growth sales, in the fourth quarter just to clarify that?
Kathleen Winters: No.
Warren Gardiner: Like would have been in 1Q you had on the cash payment, the growth sales?
Kathleen Winters: If I have not come in Q4 that cash would have come in Q1 and that cash was across the pretty broad group of clients, so there’s no at one client or two clients, there was quite a number of clients that for sure.
Henry Fernandez: And by the way this is all in the - in our normal qualitative of cash collections, so there were no incentives for them to pay as earlier or anything like that or some people to discount or whatever it’s zero, I mean it was all in the normal course of collecting cash.
Warren Gardiner: So what is the - with sales of the gross sales number would that have been many different, I guess was more?
Kathleen Winters: No.
Warren Gardiner: Okay, thank you. And then my other question was you know on the index subscription basis a really nice quarter for growth again. So obviously I like around right there, but I do want to ask because you've seen the growth in the number of kind of non-U.S. mutual funds kind of slow pretty significantly recently. So I mean how do you guys thinking about that trend maybe impacting that gross sales outlook for the index subscription basis. I mean obviously there are some other stuff that's gone pretty well in custom and factor, but just kind of thinking about the legacy sort of active mutual fund manager with emerging market mutual fund or just do you know anything on those things?
Henry Fernandez: Well, I think the value of our benchmarking product line to mutual funds all over the world dramatically increased in the last few years, the value because on an average of general basis mutual funds used to be sort of largely benchmark to indices but doing whatever they wanted, with the pressure intense pressure by passive investing which is obviously did benchmark replicated in the benchmark, the mutual funds have to spend a lot more time understanding the benchmark which is some respects the competition, because that's where passive is coming from. Really establishing a lot more discipline on whether they overweight, whether they underweight if they run a little more concentrated portfolio what the exact risks are you know all that and so on and so forth, so that add to the input of our clients subscribing more to our information in more locations, with more people, with more intensity, and all of that. Secondly we don't - we typically constantly put more and more data, more and more new things into the same modules to the same packages of data. So the client is constantly getting an upgrade product so if you say, if do not price increases the product is a lot big bigger to a lot more valuable for the prices remained the same. So if you're basically have increased the price you want to think about it that way. So that's what has added significant interest and potential to what we learn in the third element is obviously the subscription here is catch subscriptions to market indices, but also add subscription to factor indices, factor indices are not just being used for passive, we have clients subscribing to fact indices in the benchmarking product line and is dramatic indices and the ESG indices and all of that, so all of that is expanding our relationship with our clients and our value added to our client. Despite the headwind that pretty much every mutual fund in the world has clearly with a lot stronger in the U.S. getting stronger in Europe, best strong in Asia, Asia is much more mutual fund driven at this point, so different dynamic and different regions of the world.
Warren Gardiner: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Sanche of Raymond Jameson. Your line is now open.
Patrick Sanche: Hey, good afternoon, I guess. First question just a little bit of housekeeping, the incremental $5 million to $6 million expenses you capitalized or you amortize your capitalized software in 2017, is that incremental the $5 million to $6 million versus 2016 if I recall correctly said it was basically nominal this past year?
Kathleen Winters: No it’s not incremental, is $5 million to $6 million in 2017, but it was a pretty small number, couple of million in 2016.
Patrick Sanche: All right thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, curious if you can share any thoughts on that Morningstar open indexes initiative that they talked about last I think it's December or November. It kind of interesting from the perspective that know there's a handful of buy side firms expressed displeasure with their indices licensing fees and certainly the initiative would be seeming to come after you a little bit, so curious about your thoughts on that?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, so first of all there's always been competition and new entrance I mean it running the company for 21 years there's always been so many creating another formally or globally indices, if you're going to look around there you could look at three, four, five branded indices providers or one category or another who have international indices, well all over in the world right. So that’s not new, I mean there’s always been those offerings throughout the last 20 years. I think is that, it's very hard, I mean - our value proposition is to be a standard of communication and a standard of comparisons, communication between the asset owner and the asset manager and a standard of comparison across investment products and across different entities. So that the throwing at standard like that is very hard, because then you lose that standard being issues here, if you say okay, English is the language of the world, and you say now okay, now we're going to speak here, only three of us, well the mark right because the standard is English, right. So that's pretty hard to this on. The third element already that we are high value added and obviously premium product line will that standard it continuously innovating, continuously renovating the indices and the benchmark and all of that continuously evolving, so I’ll mix it also harder to catch up with that process as well.
Patrick Sanche: Great thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi this is Andrew Nicholas filling in for Chris. Just on the net sales front in the analytics segment. Obviously those were solid numbers in the quarter, but it does look like constant currency run rate growth continues to decelerate, just wondering if you can help me better understand what's driving that dynamic?
Kathleen Winters: Yeah there was a slight FX impact on the run rate. I don't have that number in my fingertips right now we can get that for you Andrew. But I think the key point here is that if you look at the sales numbers for really the second half of the year we've seen pretty healthy sales numbers in analytics in the Q4 30% and Q3 the recurring sales number was 26%. So even despite the cancels which are really isolated to those specific client segment that we referred to earlier. We’re pretty happy with overall performance.
Andrew Nicholas: Okay, thank you.
Kathleen Winters: Yeah I'm just checking the run rate numbers here, 3.4% on a reported basis, 3.8% at FX.
Andrew Nicholas: Right, right. It's just little bit down from second and third quarter. So that's why I was looking for a little more color.
Kathleen Winters: Yeah.
Andrew Nicholas: And then the second question I think you provided a little bit of guidance segment margins for analytics, if I'm not mistaken just curious if you could talk a little bit more about maybe segment targets for 2016 in the other segments and how that is kind of relative to your long term goals? Thanks.
Kathleen Winters: Yeah, so just to reiterate the long term target, right, index 68% to 72% margin target you know we're in that range that expect to continue to execute and stay within that range. Analytics are margin rate - our exit margin rate at the end of the year is almost that the long term target range of 30% to 35% so that’s a sustainable margin rate from our perspective and there is more improvement, more margin expansion to come to get strongly into that 30% to 35%. We do of course had a little bit of lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter sometimes, but when you thing about annual margin rate we’re pretty confident and continue to progression there and then or other segment we’ve made great progress with regard to restructuring in the real estate on product and we expect that progress to continue as well.
Andrew Nicholas: Okay thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentleman this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Stephen Davidson for any further remarks.
Stephen Davidson: Thanks everyone for your time and have a great afternoon. Thank you.
Operator: So ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Stephen C. Davidson - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, Ester. Good day and welcome to the MSCI third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the quarter. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they were made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find a reconciliation of the equivalent GAAP measure in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 20 to 24 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer, and Kathleen Winters, Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good day to everyone. Please turn to slide 4 for a review of our financial results. We continue to make significant progress in executing our strategy to be a leading provider of mission-critical tools to the investment community worldwide. And this translated into strong financial results again in the third quarter. A 28% increase in adjusted EPS was driven by a 7% increase in operating revenue, a 3% increase in costs, an 11% increase in adjusted EBITDA and almost 200 basis point decline in our effective tax rate, and a 13% decline in share count. In terms of revenue growth, the 7.3% increase in revenue was driven principally by double-digit growth in recurring subscription revenue in Index. In Index, I'm very pleased that MSCI was selected by the Wealth Management Association, or WMA, in the UK to replace a competitor as the provider of five multi-asset class indices used by the group's membership. The WMA in the UK represents wealth advisory firms and together manage $1.1 trillion in assets on behalf of more than 4 million clients. This win marks a significant milestone in our strategy to market our products and services to advisory firms in the wealth management industry worldwide. Analytics revenue grew 4.1% on a foreign exchange adjusted basis. And while this revenue growth was not yet where we wanted it to be, this was a strong quarter for us in terms of delivering new products and capabilities that will significantly enhance our capabilities in fixed income Analytics, one of our targeted growth areas in this product line. All Other revenue grew 12.4% on a foreign exchange adjusted basis and excluding the Real Estate occupiers sale which we closed in early August. Within All Other, the ESG continues to register strong top-line growth of high-teens in revenue – accounting revenues and low-20%s in run rate and on the back of record sales in the quarter. Turning to operational efficiency, our second pillar, the strong top-line numbers were complemented by a 3.7% increase in adjusted EBITDA expenses or a 5.8% increase on a foreign exchange adjusted basis. During the quarter, we continued our relentless expense management process and our strong productivity gains to fuel both continued strong organic investment and profit margin expansion. We are confident that we can continue to do both and they cannot be mutually exclusive. As a result of the success of these processes, we're lowering our fiscal year cost guidance. Kathleen will go over the new cost guidance in her section. Our tax reduction project is continuing. And we're now in the final stages of planning. We expect to implement this new plan in early 2017 and see the benefit in about 200 basis point reduction in the effective tax rate by sometime in 2018. Our third pillar is our capital optimization. Our board authorized management to explore financing options in late July. We executed in early August. And we have opportunistically tapped the debt markets for $500 million of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a very attractive coupon of 4.75%, one of the records at that time for a high-yield issuer. The debt financing has temporarily moved us above our stated gross leverage range of 3 times to 3.5 times and we expect to move back into this range over time as our adjusted EBITDA grows. In the third quarter and through October 21, we repurchased a total of 923,000 shares at an average price of $79.48 for a total of $73.4 million. Most of these repurchases were executed after the quarter closed where we took advantage of volatility in the market. We continue to have the same capital allocation policies that we have had for the past couple of years. And we are committed to returning capital to our investors. So the philosophy guiding our share repurchase programs and dividend policy continues to be the same. In any given quarter, however, we may be subject to blackout periods or other restrictions on repurchasing of our shares, which may slow the pace of repurchase activity in a quarter. These are just tactical actions. And we remain committed to our strategic goal of returning capital through share repurchases. Furthermore, we are strategic investors in our stock and we always look for opportunities to take advantage of volatility in the markets to buy more shares. We are willing to be patient and wait for those opportunities in those volatile markets, so this discipline may also impact the pace of repurchase activity in any given quarter. So, in summary, continued strong revenue generation and a relentless focus on expense management drove an 11% increase in adjusted EBITDA, which combined with an almost 200 basis point decrease in our tax rate and a 13% decrease in our share count, drove a very impressive 20% increase in adjusted EPS. And year-to-date adjusted EPS is 34% above the prior-year level. Turning to slide 5, we highlight here one of our largest and key product areas, recurring subscription revenue in Index. Year-over-year, Index recurring subscription run rate has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of 10% for the past years ending Q3 2016 and is a key component of the overall growth of our company. The investments we're making in Index have been the driver of this consistent high-quality revenue stream and our focus is to continue to innovate and invest to ensure that the compounding effect is maintained. As this slide highlights, compound annual growth of 8% in our largest contributor, developed market indices, and growth of 10% in our second largest contributor, emerging market indices, are complemented by double-digit growth in both factor, ESG, and thematic indices, and customized and specialized indices, giving us a combined run rate growth of 10%. We believe this combined growth rate is sustainable. In order to support growth in all areas of our Equity Index product line, we are focused on capturing, what I call, the waves of growth in the market and I'd like to think of these waves in two dimensions. The first dimension are the waves by actual investment objectives. The globalization wave, where investors are expanding the scope of their investments from a domestic-bias view to more of a global view incorporating all developed markets, emerging and frontier markets, and global small caps. Investment institutions around the world are still very far from a steady-state in this area. The factor investing wave, which clients are incorporating factors into their active and passive investment approach, we are just at the beginning of this wave. And lastly the ESG wave, as environmental, social, and government criteria are integrated more and more into the mainstream of the investment process. These are still very early days in this wave. The other dimension of these waves of growth in the market is by application or by use case. So, first, we saw the wave of growth in active management. That continues, but it's still – but it's a little more mature. This is now followed by the wave of growth in passive investing in all types of wrappers, whether it's ETFs or mutual funds or pooled vehicles or separately managed accounts, et cetera. And lastly, the derivative wave, which supports growth in exchange traded futures and options and in structured derivative products in multi-country, multi-currency equity indices. This wave is in its infancy, since the market has been dominated by single currency Equity Index Derivative products, especially in the exchange traded sector. We believe that MSCI by capturing these waves of growth through our strategy to capture new client segments up-sell to our existing clients or establish new use cases, we believe MSCI is extremely well-positioned to lead in all of these rapidly growing areas in the overall investment process. And we're terribly excited and all of this underpins our belief in the growth rates that we have in all of these three categories, which is subscription, passive fees, or asset-based fees, and derivative fees. Let's turn to slide 6, which highlights the strength of our franchise as a leading provider of indices to the ETF marketplace, one of the many segments that we're addressing. The global ETF landscape is comprised of many ETF providers who even within their own product lineup have various pricing, client, product, and distribution strategies. Similarly, MSCI's ETF licensing business consist of a diverse group of over 850 ETFs sponsored by a range of ETF providers and listed on various exchanges around the world. As a result of this diversity and the strength of our indices, we've been able to license to many different type of ETF providers and assets under management in ETF linked to our indices have grown 57% over the past three years from about $300 billion in Q3 2013 to about $475 billion in the current quarter. We are focused on both sides. On one hand, AUM linked to our indices. And on the other hand, the revenue we derived from them. Even though there are significant changes and some fee pressures in the ETF industry, we remain focused on revenue growth and do not see any let-up in our revenue growth rates in this area. I should note that the recent pricing change announced by one of our largest clients in the ETF space affects only five ETF linked to MSCI indices. Those ETFs have about $33 billion of the total $475 billion linked to our indices. And given the structure of our arrangement, there is no impact to our revenue related to this pricing announcement. These lower-cost ETFs linked to MSCI indices are designed for more price sensitive retail investors where they have seen more pricing pressure in the U.S. as a result of competition between ETF providers to attract assets. In addition, the recent announcement of the Department of Labor with respect to the fiduciary rule is expected to drive more retail assets into passive investment products, like ETFs, and is expected to benefit ETF providers and index providers, like MSCI, even indices of these products are reduced. So in line with the strategies being incremented by some of our largest clients, we believe that, over time, the trade-off in ETF between price and volume is favorable to us and to many ETF providers and we're well-positioned to benefit from this trade-off. Let's turn to slide 7, which shows our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target for Analytics compared to where our margin is this year and where it was last year. The long-term target for Analytics are upper-single-digits revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins of 30% to 35%. As we shared with you last year during our third quarter 2015 earnings call, the adjusted EBITDA for full year of 2014 for Analytics of $72 million is the baseline for evaluating the progress towards the long-term target. The annualization of our Q3 2016 Analytics adjusted EBITDA resulted in an annualized adjusted EBITDA of about $126 million or about 28%. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to pull cost out of the product line or relocate cost to other higher yielding opportunities within Analytics. So we remain confidence that, over time, we can achieve the longer term targets of EBITDA margins of 30% to 35%. The next step in our plan toward achieving our long-term targets will be driven by incremental revenue from several key initiatives that will continue to require incremental investment in the quarters and the years ahead. The three key areas that we're focused on to generate this incremental revenue are as follows. First is fixed income analytics. This is a very important initiative for us. We are building our key functionality to replace the leading incumbent with select clients that we already have relationships with. The delivery of the new fixed income factor model, transaction-based performance attribution, and several upgrades to both RiskManager and BarraOne this quarter, support this initiative. Next growth area is services. We are right now in the process of identifying client operational pain points that will help us refine our service offering toward these clients and lead to potential future managed service opportunities. As we evolve to a more services-focused approach from a more product-centric approach, the opportunity for MSCI to leverage our workflow tools are amplified significantly. And, lastly, our third growth area is the new Analytics application platform. This single point of entry for all of our analytical data and content is in beta testing right now. We expect to have a commercially viable platform ready in the first half of 2017, and then we expect incremental sales to begin in the latter part of 2017 and build up on 2018. And accompanying all these key initiatives, we continue to implement a more systematic process of price increases in Analytics, commensurate with the enhancements that we make to our systems for the benefit of our clients, while continuing to maintain high retention rates. With that, let me now pass it on to Kathleen.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Thanks, Henry, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll start on slide 8 where I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results. We delivered a very strong Q3 across all of these measures and were very pleased with our overall execution as well as a strong rebound in AUMs and ETFs linked to our indexes. So let me walk you through each measure. We delivered a 7.3% increase in revenue, driven primarily by a 6% increase in recurring subscription revenue, and a 10.6% increase in asset-based fee revenue. There was a negligible impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our subscription revenues. As a reminder, we do not provide the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our asset-based fees tied to average AUM, of which approximately two-thirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses were up 3% and 4%, respectively, on a reported basis. Expenses that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations represented approximately 40% of adjusted EBITDA expenses in Q3. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 5% and 6%, respectively, reflecting an approximate $3 million FX benefit. The primary currency move that drove this benefit was the British pound, which was substantially weaker quarter-over-quarter. Additionally, there were smaller benefits from the Mexican peso, the Indian rupee, the Swiss franc, offset in part by yen strengthening. We delivered a 13% increase in operating income and an 11% increase in adjusted EBITDA, resulting in a 210 basis point increase in our operating margins, and a 180 basis point increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 49.7%. Our effective tax rate was 33.1% down 190 basis points from 35% in the prior year as we continue to better align our tax structure with our global operating footprint. Diluted EPS and adjusted EPS increased 15% and 28%, respectively. Diluted EPS in the third quarter of last year included the benefit of a $6.3 million gain on sale of an investment, which was excluded from our adjusted EPS. Free cash flow was up 9% year-over-year at $133 million, primarily driven by higher billings and collections from customers and lower cash payments for income taxes, including the impact of tax refunds, partially offset by higher interest payments. In summary, this was a very strong quarter. On slide 9, you see a walk showing the different drivers of EPS growth in Q3. Adjusted EPS increased $0.17 from $0.60 per share to $0.77 per share, or 28% in comparison to third quarter 2015. Strong revenue growth from both subscription and asset-based fees contributed $0.12 per share. Investments in our product segments and operations reduced earnings by $0.05. We continue to spend in the highest growth, highest return areas with growth in costs across Index and ESG somewhat offset by continued efficiencies in Real Estate. The lower effective tax rate contributed $0.02 per share. Next, in terms of capital optimization, share repurchases benefited EPS as well. We've reduced our average weighted diluted share count by 13% with a partial offset from higher net interest expense, resulting in net accretion of $0.06 per share. And lastly, FX had a net $0.01 per share positive impact. On slides 10 through 13, I'll walk you through our segment results. So let's begin with the Index segment on slides 10 and 11. Revenues for Index increased 11.4% on a reported basis driven primarily by a 10.6% increase in recurring subscriptions with growth in core products, factor and thematic usage fees and custom products. As well as a 10.6% increase in asset-based fee revenue. We also had higher non-recurring revenues which increased $1 million year-over-year, mainly due to one-time history data purchases by several clients as well as other non-recurring services. In terms of our operating metrics, recurring subscription sales in the quarter were basically flat compared to prior year and Aggregate Retention remained high at approximately 96% in line with the prior-year and the previous quarter. Index run rate grew by $59 million or 11% compared to September 30, 2015. This was driven by an increase in subscription run rate of $34 million or 10%, and a $24 million or 13% increase in asset-based fee run rate. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Index was 70.8% versus 72.7% in the prior year and up from 70% in second quarter 2016. Turning to slide 11, you have detail on our asset-based fees. Starting with the upper left-hand chart, overall asset-based fee revenue increased $5 million or 11% over Q3 2015, driven by a $3 million or 24% increase in revenue from the non-ETF related passive product areas. The increase in revenue from the non-ETF related passive product was primarily due to initial fund fees recognized in the quarter. Non-ETF passive assets linked to MSCI indexes were flat year-over-year and experienced a slight improvement in the average basis point fee, so core revenue growth was slightly above the prior year. The remaining $2 million increase was driven by two components. First, $1 million or 4% increase in revenue from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, resulting from a 12% increase in average AUMs partially offset by the impact of changes in product mix. And additionally, we had a $1 million or 60% increase in revenue from exchange traded futures and options contracts based on MSCI indexes. Total trading volume in these contracts increased 37% year-over-year and are running up 45% year-to-date versus the prior year. In the upper right-hand chart, you can see that we ended the third quarter with a record $475 billion in period-end ETFs, AUM linked to MSCI indexes. This resulted from market appreciation of $24 billion and cash inflows of $11 billion during the quarter. As shown in the lower left-hand chart, quarter-end AUM by market exposure of MSCI linked ETFs reflected strong growth in EM, which increased approximately 47% year-over-year and recorded $15 billion in inflows in Q3 alone. Lastly, on the lower right-hand chart, you can see the year-over-year decline in the average basis point fee from 3.4 to 3.11. This decline was driven primarily by increased asset flows to and market appreciation in lower-cost ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. Compared to second quarter, the average basis point fee was essentially flat and benefited from the strong flows into EM market cap funds in late Q3. On slide 12, we highlight the financials for the Analytics segment. Revenues for Analytics increased 2.7% to $111 million on a reported basis, which includes a $1.5 million negative impact from FX. Excluding the impact of FX, Analytics revenue increased 4.1%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher revenues from equity models driven by the increasing focus of hedge funds on factors to explain investment performance. Additionally, we had higher RiskManager and InvestorForce revenue in the quarter. We had a very nice increase in recurring sales, which were 26% higher compared to the prior-year third quarter, due to higher RiskManager, equity model, and BarraOne sales partially offset by slightly lower InvestorForce sales. And gross sales, which include non-recurring sales, were up $3.7 million or 31%. So a very strong new sales quarter. However, we did see higher cancels for Analytics in the quarter. We're continuing to see cost pressures and budgetary constraints among some clients, particularly banks and wealth management subsidiaries of banks. Also, we continue to see a challenging environment for hedge funds primarily in the U.S., which resulted in higher levels of RiskManager cancels in the quarter in the U.S. and in Europe. The cancels were $10.5 million for Q3 and are a function of a challenging market for our clients and the continuation of the market conditions we saw in Q2 and have discussed on last quarter's call. We are continuing with our systematic price increases in Analytics. This process is going well and cancels are market-driven and not a result of our price increases. As a result of the higher cancels in the quarter, which get annualized to determine the quarterly retention rate, Analytics retention declined to 90% down from 95% a year ago. But year-to-date retention remains high at 92% compared to 94% in the same period last year. Analytics run rate at September 30 grew by $22 million or 5% to $452 million compared to prior year and the impact of FX was not significant. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% up from 27% in the prior year. While we are seeing some elongation of the sales cycle, the overall Analytics pipeline remains strong. And the importance of our risk tools in helping our clients gain deeper insight into portfolio performance and respond to increasingly complex regulatory reporting requirements is only increasing. Turning to slide 13, we show results for the All Other segment. Revenues for All Other increased 3% to $19 million on a reported basis and grew 12% after adjusting for the disposal of the Occupiers business and the impact of FX. First, in terms of ESG, a $2 million or 18% increase in ESG revenue to $11 million was due to strong ESG Ratings revenue on record ESG sales. Growth continues to be driven by the increasing integration of ESG into the mainstream of the investment process and new client acquisition. Real Estate revenues, however, decreased $1 million or 14% to $8 million on a reported basis. However, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the sale of the Occupiers business, which closed in early August, Real Estate revenues increased 6%. The All Other adjusted EBITDA margin was 0.4%, up from a negative17.4% in the prior year. The substantial increase in the adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by continued strong growth in ESG revenue as well as lower Real Estate costs, primarily due to a reduction in head count and strong cost management as we make progress toward improving profitability in our Real Estate product area. On a sequential quarter basis, All Other revenue declined $7 million primarily due to normal seasonality. Q2 of each year is seasonally strong for Real Estate when the majority of annual Portfolio Analysis Service reports are delivered to clients. This seasonality also drove the sequential quarter decline in the adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment. Turning to slide 14, you have an update on our capital return activity. As you know, we've returned substantial amounts of capital to investors in recent years. Specifically, since 2012, we've returned almost $2 billion through share repurchases and dividends. In Q3, and through October 21, we repurchased and settled 923,000 shares at an average price of $79.48 for a total value of $73.4 million. Yesterday, our board approved a $750 million increase in our outstanding authorization, bringing the total repurchase authorization outstanding to $1.1 billion. There's been no change to our capital allocation policy; we will always be looking at the full array of options before us to deploy capital. Given this, there may be times when we are subject to blackout periods or restrictions on repurchasing our shares because of any number of factors. We view ourselves as a strategic buyer in our own shares and we will be flexible as we look to take advantage of market volatility to repurchase more shares. On slide 15, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $974 million. This includes $188 million of cash held outside the United States and a domestic cash cushion of approximately $125 million to $150 million, which is the general policy we maintain for operational purposes. In August, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes due 2026 at a very attractive coupon of 4.75%. As a result, our gross leverage was 3.8 times at the end of the quarter. Over time, we expect that we will return to our stated range of 3 times to 3.5 times as our adjusted EBITDA grows. Lastly, before we open the line for Q&A, on slide 16 we're updating our full-year guidance. Based on the progression of our investments and the efficiencies that we have achieved year-to-date, we are lowering our full-year adjusted EBITDA expense guidance to $580 million to $590 million, down from our previous guidance of $600 million to $615 million. We're very happy with our progress on our productivity initiatives and this is reflected in the guidance. Next, we are increasing our full-year 2016 interest expense guidance to $102 million, reflecting the impact of the recently issued senior notes due in 2026. One of the key strengths of our financial model is that it's highly cash generative. Given our strong operating results and the benefit of lower cash taxes and Q3 tax refunds, we are increasing our full-year net cash provided by operating activities to $350 million to $375 million and our free cash flow range to $305 million to $335 million. Lastly, we are narrowing our full-year CapEx guidance to $40 million to $45 million based on the $32 million that we had recorded year-to-date in our outlook for Q4 spend. In summary, we are very pleased with our results for Q3. We executed well throughout the quarter. We delivered solid financial results. We continue to execute a consistent capital allocation strategy. And we're continuing to invest in and innovate the new products that will position MSCI to continue to grow in the quarters and years ahead. With that, we're happy to open the line and take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: So just, Henry, you already proactively addressed the whole ETF fee pressure debate that's been going on. But maybe you can flesh it out a little bit more. I mean, surprising to hear that no revenue impact. So maybe if you can talk about the pricing structures a little bit more why is there no revenue impact, and then also, looking forward a little bit, how do you feel about incremental pressure that could be coming beyond those five that you highlighted? Do you think it's consistent with – revenue should be limited? Do you feel like there could be more pricing pressure on the institutional side at some point and maybe levered there a little bit different? So just a little bit more color so we can put the debate a little bit more to rest. Thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Alex. The – look, I think we've got to start from obviously the bigger perspective and that is, the ETF industry is growing by leaps and bounds all over the world, but especially in the U.S. and Europe. And we're trying to make it grow fast in Asia, but it's been a bit more challenging. That ETF industry is going to gather large amounts of assets in market beta, if you want to think about them, and in factor beta and eventually in ESG betas and, hopefully, also in actively managed funds. Although, so far, that segment of the market is not that large. We believe that that continues to be a fairly large growth part of the investment process. And as I said, we'll gather quite a lot of assets. So that part of the volume, so to speak, will benefit us and many ETF managers significantly. Then inside that global ETF industry, there are a lot of different participants with a lot of different pricing strategies, market segments and product offerings and all of that. And there is increasing levels of competition particularly in the U.S., and especially for retail investors. So we are likely to see PTR erosion of this ETF product line particular in the more competitive areas of the market since we are in the U.S., particularly the retail competition and leading up to this fiduciary rule by the Department of Labor, it's going to drive some early adopters of lower fees and all of that in order to capture more assets, particularly assets away from mutual funds and actively managed mutual funds. So, clearly, all of that is happening and we, at MSCI, are partners with a lot of these ETF managers and we want to remain partners with them and help them achieve those strategies. And as we have talked about in the past, with particularly one entity, iShares, we've had differentiated pricing between the large- and mid-cap standard MSCI indices globally and the ETF on those, which are more targeted to institutional investors with higher liquidity, higher bid-ask spreads and all of that, and in more the core funds, which are the All Cap indices around the world and have lower management fees and have had lower – already have lower licensing fees from MSCI. So I think that our focus is on two or three things. One is the size of the industry and how we capture a lot more assets; i.e., the volume. And that would lead to a lot of revenue and large growth of revenues. Secondly, working with our partners to adjust and be flexible with our pricing strategies, which we have already done. We have already effective. There is zero new news on that in any of these announcements that have been going on. And then, three, innovate with a lot of new products so that those new products not only can be priced attractively for us but also capture a lot of market share. So I think, in a nutshell, the announcement and the sort of reports that have come out in the last few weeks have not really changed the strategy of MSCI and have not really changed the pricing strategy of MSCI.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Thanks for that. And then just, secondly, maybe, on the retention rate that came down, again, you addressed it already a little bit, too. But on the Analytics side, in particularly, do you feel like most of what led to that low retention, you kind of through that in terms of any sort of hedge fund pressure that is maybe leading some incremental cancels or do you think the environment is still very uncertain on the retention rate?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, look, it's a – I think that's a good question as well. And let me try to abstract from it again. We, at MSCI, continue to produce very strong financial results. But we do so – and we do so with a lot of strong wins in our back in terms of passive investing and in terms of ESG investing and risk management and all the things – globalization, all the things that we always talked about. But we are really selling into an investment industry around the world in which significant segments of that industry are being challenged. Active managers are being challenged. Banks, hedge funds, funds of funds, wealth managers, subsidiaries of banks, not because the wealth managers are not doing well, it's because when the banks – when the senior management of banks decide to have cost measures, cost management measures, they do so across the board in order to have the wealth management subsidiaries which are doing well contribute larger amounts of profitability to compensate for the pressure that they see on the investment bank or the commercial bank. So that leads to some pressures in segments of our marketplace. There are other segments that are doing well for us, like, non-bank subsidiaries – non-bank on wealth managers, patient funds, sovereign wealth funds and all of that and we can talk a lot about that. Right? So the pressure continue. In this particular quarter, we saw a meaningful pressure on funds of funds or our HedgePlatform product line, we saw meaningful pressure from the wealth management subsidiaries of U.S. banks, we saw some pressure from the investment banks in Europe as well and alike. And therefore, the majority of these $10 million in cancels, were attributed to those cost pressures and resulted in partial cancels, resulted in shutdowns of hedge funds, shutdowns of funds of funds, as an example, the reduction of services from wealth managers and all of that. We believe that that trend will continue. Now it will be bumpy. There will be some quarters in which the retention will zoom up because the cancels were lower. In other quarters in which the retention is lower, like it did in this third quarter, the cancels will be elevated. There's nothing new there in the way we're looking at the product line and our strategy and all of that. We believe that the health of the business is also demonstrated by the strong recurring sales in Analytics and strong one-time sales, non-recurring sales in Analytics. But I think we will continue to have those pressures and every quarter when there is pressure maybe a different set of client segments, there be more in one area and more in another area, you may be compensated by lower retentions in other areas or much higher sales in other areas like pension funds or sovereign wealth funds, but it will continue like this. But net – net-net, we think that the product line continues in this progression of growth. We wanted to be more rapid in the top line, but we're sure of growth and profitability.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: And, Alex, maybe I can just add to that a little bit. We did talk about; in Q2 we saw these conditions as well. And Q3 here is really a continuation of that, and as Henry said, probably will continue in the near-term. Right? And if you look at historically, Q4 is usually a higher quarter for us in terms of cancels. So, we'll see how that goes in Q4, but let's just put it in the overall context for Analytics. For the quarter, organically Analytics revenue up 4% and in fact new sales, recurring sales of 26%, and then if you include even one-time sales, up 31% for the quarter. In addition, continuing to make progress in Analytics on margin expansion. So, we continue to execute there. Certainly concerned about the cancels being high, don't like to see that, but we're working hard to minimize that.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Actually one other thought that I forgot, because there's been some speculation that the – some reports that some of these cancels came from are across the board price increases, in Analytics. There's very, very little effect of our price increase in these cancels. They had very little to do with our price increases. Our price increases are going relatively well, obviously, nobody likes to see price increases in our client base but they're going well. And we will continue to execute on them.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Excellent. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Henry, I just wanted to clarify your comment on Alex's question about the BlackRock fee cuts not impacting revenues. Is that because it's just too small as a percentage of AUM or is it because contractually the pricing change doesn't flow through to you guys?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: We already have a formula with them on the core shares – the core iShares. That has a formula that is relative to the management fee – percentage of the management fee and it has a floor, it has a ceiling. And a lot of that was already in the lower end of that range. So, the management fee gets cut or the fee are gets cut, we're already at those low levels. And there hasn't been any change on the pricing of the product at all with them. Now, over time, for sure, right, as we tried to capture assets, they tried to capture assets and what I mean more aggressive we may have other discussions about how to create pricing strategies that get us much more volume and even if it's lower fees. But none of those discussions are taking place right now.
Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Appreciate the clarification. And then just on the Analytics revenue projection over the next few years, does that include any contributions from potential wins from replacing the Barclays, Bloomberg POINT system, which I think was announced after you gave your initial guidance. And then how should we be thinking about the timing of the incremental investment for growth to flow through the business?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So all of these projections that we show have in them both the investments, the organic investments that we referred to, so I don't want anybody thinking that these incremental investments that I referred to will be added to this and, therefore, lower our targets of EBITDA margin in the future. And secondly, they also do reflect the contributions to revenues from all these initiatives, the fixed income analytics initiative, the services offering Analytics and the new platform – the new sort of a technology platform Analytics product line. So, all of that is there. Now, they are back-ended because as you developed a fixed income capabilities for both, not only for fixed income analytics – for fixed income portfolio management but also fixed income analytics in the context of the multi-asset class analytics offering, right. So the investments we're making there give you incremental revenue that are part of that progression of revenue growth, constant currency revenue growth to the high-single-digit, and the same thing with the offering, the service offering on the new platform. But they are back ended. So I don't anticipate or I would anticipate us getting closer to the 30% to 35% EBITDA margin first before we get closer to the high-single-digit revenue growth, because revenue, it gets back-ended in terms of the investment and the progression of getting clients and all of that. I mean, as you know, it just takes time to accumulate those run rates. So within fixed income analytics, per se, yeah, this is a strategic area for us for many, many years as we talked about for many years we also wanted to solve this inorganically through some acquisition and we're praying and hoping that that will happen, and properties have come to the market, but we haven't liked the prices. We've been very – very disciplined buyers and have passed therefore. And now the time has come in which we got to do it organically because we've been waiting too long. And we really need to start filling out this whole area and that's what we're doing gradually now.
Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Andrew Owen Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. This is actually Andrew Nicholas filling in for Chris. Just one question. I believe most of my other ones have been answered. On EBITDA expense, I believe your guidance implies fourth quarter expense around $150 million at its midpoint. If I take that run rate into 2017, it looks like year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis would be around 3%. I'm just curious if that's a fair way to be thinking about next year, and if so, in either case, what are the key spending areas that we should be thinking about that would drive EBITDA expense higher than that Q4 run rate?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: So as we think about our planning, Andrew, and as we've talked about, we think about our model being strong top-line growth coupled with really controlling our expenses. Right? And we talk about high-single-digit revenue growth rate but capping expenses at a 5%-ish growth rate. Now we are in the midst of our planning process right now, so I really can't say specifically what 2017 is going to look at, but when you just think about conceptually the nature of our expenses and our expense base and our expense base being primarily compensation-related because we're a people business, right, and you think about the inflation associated with that year-over-year. Add onto that, right, the investments that we want to continue to make in our fast-growing spaces, particularly in Index and ESG, in fixed income analytics, that's kind of how we think about our expenses. We want to be able to fund the fast-growing parts of our business, but at the same time, we want to be able to find productivity to fund that really for all of the projects that we see across the board that have high returns.
Andrew Owen Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right, that's helpful. That's all I had. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Good morning.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, as you mentioned, new sales in Analytics were actually strong and – but clearly the retention rate in Analytics was a little bit light, as we've been discussing. Could you just give some color on whether there's a difference between the products that are being demanded on the new sales front versus the products that clients are canceling.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, on the cancel side, Toni, the epicenter, so to speak, of the cancels this past quarter were in multi-asset class RiskManager product – the product line there to hedge funds, some smaller hedge funds that shut down, for example. Also to wealth in the U.S., let's say, to wealth management subsidiaries of banks in the U.S. which also offer that multi-asset class RiskManager product line. So that was one area. Another area is HedgePlatform or funds of funds, a much smaller negative impact with that. We have had relatively little cancels on BarraOne which is more of the factor-based multi-asset class risk management product line. A lot of that is to asset managers and pensions funds, so very little cancels there, if anything good sales there. Very strong sales in equity analytics models and applications, particularly to equity long/short hedge funds that are being asked by various institutional clients to report the performance and risk of their portfolios on a factor basis. That is definitely an increasing trend and we hope to capture that. Those have been the areas where some of these issues have been focused on.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then you've mentioned success in fixed income analytics. Are you targeting sort of existing customers that already have some of the equity analytics or multi-asset class analytics or are you going after sort of new fixed income only shops?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. Well, first of all, the success has been in just launching the product and putting cost in the company. We are hoping to have success in generating revenues, but not yet, right, because we just started this effort. Our main focus on – clearly, there are two focus. Right. The fixed income analytics as it relates to the multi-asset class offering. And then there is the fixed income analytics for the fixed income portfolio managers alone. Right? So in that area, our main focus is to go to those clients that we already have a large relationship with in multi-asset class analytics and in equity analytics for their equity portfolio management team and round-up the efforts in fixed income and the fixed income portfolio management side, that's been one big effort. And the second big effort has been targeted in the high-end of that as opposed to the low-end, the small and medium-size clients, but the bigger clients that we've had very extensive relationship with and that is – there is a lot of changes that are going on in fixed income analytics because the providers of fixed income analytics have been changing hands and all of that. So this has been driven by both. A lot of our clients have come to us and say, how can you help us manage these transitions? And obviously we've been eager to help them as well.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. Has the focus of your clients shifted towards cost versus quality particularly in the Index business? And could that shift get worse if the economy continues to do poorly? I'm wondering if you have any worries around pricing.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: With respect to indices and our clients, well, let me go back – with respect to our clients, particularly our active management clients are for sure, there is a lot of emphasis on cost – not dramatically different than it has been in the last two years, three years. There's a lot of emphasis on cost. Now, with respect to the Index product line, with those clients, we've been successful at selling them more things, particularly, factor indices, for example, or emerging market indices, because the emerging markets asset class has began to come back or custom indices, ESG indices and the like. And therefore, our share of their wallet has increased. Because at a time in which they need us the most. So, obviously that is coming at the expense of reductions in budgets of those clients from other providers.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. And so – and then my second question is how would you characterize the cancellations in the Analytics business? Were most of those due to hedge funds going out of business versus just kind of not needing the product anymore? And if you could – I know this is very difficult – can you quantify the percentage of spending in that business as typically discretionary? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So the expense of this is typically mission-critical for sure. So some of these cancels have been hedge funds, medium and small hedge funds shutting down, because these are largely multi-strategy hedge funds by the way, not equity long/short hedge funds. These are largely multi-strategy hedge funds that have done that, or that they have partial reduction of service because their assets under management have declined significantly. And therefore, they're less processing or they've got out modules or whatever. Right? So that's being one area. Clearly, another area is funds of funds. We know that this is an area that has been challenged, the funds of funds industry in hedge funds. And we've had some cancels there. We have wanted to make up those cancels by higher sales of our HedgePlatform product line to endowment, foundations and pension funds meaning all other forms of asset owners. But that has – we haven't spent as much time in increasing those sales. We will, in the future, but we haven't, to make up for those funds of funds decline and the like. So that has been the nature of the cancels.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Warren Gardiner with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC: Hey. Good morning. So I was wondering if you guys could – I know you sort of mentioned that there was no impact – cancels had no impact on gross – on the pricing from the pricing you exerted in the quarter. But I was wondering if you guys can just quantify the impact on gross sales from maybe some of the pricing increases you've been passing through.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: So, on the Analytics side, going back, I guess, a year or so, we really started to more systematically look at our pricing. And we continue to do that now in Analytics, really had not had an impact with regard to the cancellations. And we're going to continue to, kind of, focus on that as one of our key areas usually around 15%-ish of our revenues.
Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC: For Analytics and Index or just Analytics?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. For Analytics.
Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC: Okay, great. And then I think you guys mentioned some asset-based fees or mutual funds in the quarter, I think you talked – I think you term them initial funds fees. I mean, should we be thinking about that as a one-off like event or is that maybe – or is that the right run rate to use going forward for that line item?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: So, can you just clarify what you're asking?
Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC: All right. So, in the asset-based fees, the funds from passive mutual funds, I think there's a nice tick up, and I think you guys noted initial fund fees as one of the reasons. I was wondering if that's more a one-off or is this now kind of the right run rate to think about going forward?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, that can be kind of lumpy. I wouldn't assume that that's an ongoing run rate. That can, kind of, bounce around a little bit.
Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good morning. Henry, the adjusted expense guidance for the year has come down, obviously, significantly. If you look at over the past year, what's been the drivers of that decrease, has it been driven a combination of like FX and delayed spending and just better performance, or if you had to weigh – like, where are the savings is, how would you weigh that?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: So, look, I think in general, it's been driven by a very, very tight management of the head count, right. For example, in years past, we were growing our head count aggressively. So, we came to a situation where we felt that we had enough head count all over the world and we needed to just focus on productivity of that head count in the company. So, when you see it's almost flattish head count growth that has helped dramatically to decrease the rate of growth of EBITDA expenses. Clearly, foreign exchange has benefited us immensely there. But that's why we give you the numbers on FX adjusted basis versus non-FX adjusted basis. And you like anything else, Kathleen?
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: No. I mean, we're – as you said, really strong rigorous keeping an eye on expenses, on head count, particularly driving for more efficiency in Real Estate and Analytics. And you can see that in the margin rate. I mean we've had pretty steady margin expansion. We're going to continue to keep an eye on that.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Okay. As a follow-up, as I look at the guidance you guys gave a few quarters back in terms of your long-term adjusted EBITDA margins, the Index business is already at the top end of that range and the range was 68% to 72% now. Should we think of that range to be bumped up or are you guys be increasing your investment area commensurate with your revenue growth?
Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.: No, no, I think that rate – that range to stay like it is. There will be times in which we would be at the lower end of the range like we have been in prior quarters this year on the basis of lower ETF fees or at the same time couple with investment. There'll be times in which we would be a little bit over on the upper side of the range. But given – clearly, it's a built-in margin expansion in the Index product line, but if we really would like to see this Index product line expand for years and years and years to come, we need to continue to invest in a lot of new areas there and that's what we're doing and that's what we are capping, so to speak, the margin range to those levels. And the investments, clearly factors, it's a huge part. We need to do that and everything that goes with factor, distribution, client service, the production environment for factor indices and all of that, right, ESG indices, another part, et cetera.
Kathleen A. Winters - MSCI, Inc.: Yeah. So, as Henry said, we really are making it a priority to make sure we are funding our growth initiatives and innovation. Right? So – but we're very happy to be in that target range of 68% to 72%. And it's clearly a priority for us. Look, we've got lots of great projects that we want to fund high return projects and we want to continue to be able to do that, and it makes sense to do that for the long-term growth of the business.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Don (sic) [Steve] for any closing remarks.
Stephen C. Davidson - MSCI, Inc.: Thank you, everyone. We went over a little bit to get everyone in – on the queue. So, thank you and we'll speak again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-07-29 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Stephen C. Davidson - Head of Investor Relations Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stephen C. Davidson - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you, Chanel. Good day and welcome to the MSCI second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the quarter. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they were made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most-recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find a reconciliation of the equivalent GAAP measure in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 22 to 26 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer, and Kathleen Winters, Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Thanks, Steve, and good day, everyone. And please join me in welcoming Kathleen to her first quarterly earnings call at MSCI. Please turn to slide four for a review of our financial results. The strength of our franchise, our unique position in the investment process and disciplined execution of our growth strategy translated into strong financial results in the second quarter. First, in terms of revenue growth, we recorded a 7.4% increase in revenues, driven by double-digit growth in Index recurring subscription revenue, a 5% increase in Analytics, and a 14% increase in All Other revenue, the latter benefiting from a 20% increase in ESG revenues. Our top-line growth was dampened by the market volatility in the quarter, which led to a decline in equity values, as we all know, and this impacted our asset-based fees. Since the end of the quarter, though, AUM linked to MSCI indexes has rebounded and have set new all-time records. Turning now to operational efficiency, the strong top-line numbers were complemented by a 5% decline in adjusted EBITDA expenses. We continue to be focused and disciplined on ensuring that our cost base is right-sized and aligned with our most attractive investment opportunities. As we've discussed on this call in first quarter, we expected that first half of 2016 was going to have lower levels of investment and therefore, EBITDA expenses. We also indicated at that time that we are increasing the pace of investment in the second half of the year as we focus on capturing new opportunities in fixed income and multi-asset class analytics and building our new Analytics interface and completing various IT projects. And additionally and most importantly, we're also investing in our Index franchise to preserve and grow our leadership in market cap indexes and position us to be the leader in indexes in the fast growing areas of factors or smart beta, ESG, custom, and thematic indexes. All of these investments that I'm referring to are duly reflected in our EBITDA expense guidance. Our tax planning work continues, and we remain confident that we'll be able to reduce our operating tax rate to the low-30%s over the next few years. Finally, in terms of capital optimization, we continued to repurchase shares in the quarter, and the board has authorized the increase of our regular quarterly dividend by 27% to $0.28 per share. Our financial model is very powerful, high-single-digit revenue growth combined with the strong expense management results in a significant expansion in operating leverage and, therefore, our earnings. The compounding effect of this financial model makes MSCI highly cash-generative, which provides us with the flexibility to deploy this capital for organic opportunities, both on acquisitions, share repurchases, or dividend payments. We're also committed to maintaining our gross financial leverage in the range of 3 times to 3.5 times. Given that we are currently at the low-end of our range, we are assessing financing options to increase our leverage. So in summary, a strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management drove a 24% increase in adjusted EBITDA, which combined with a 250-basis point decrease in our effective tax rate and a 14% decrease in our share count drove a very impressive 38% increase in adjusted EPS. Let's now turn to slide five, in which we have a refresh of our business strategy. Our mission is to be a leading provider of mission-critical investment decision tools. To achieve this objective, we must have superior content and state-of-the-art software applications. By content, we mean the research models with the right data and the analytics that then are enabled by a smart state-of-the-art applications. We believe that companies that are best-in-class at combining content and applications will grow faster and gain market share over time. With content and applications combined, the opportunity to create new products and services and new offerings is immense, and that is exactly what we're doing at MSCI in the investment process for our clients. We are evolving from a product-centric focus to a business model where our tools can help our clients provide answers to their most pressing investment problems and opportunities. We can leverage the four powerful attributes listed on this slide to create new offerings and strengthen the current ones. Leveraging our unique position in the investment process, informed by a deep understanding of our client needs, we will use a research-driven approach to innovate and develop new content in the form of models, data, and analytics, and we will deliver that content to our clients through smart and state-of-the-art applications. If you turn to slide six, this highlights our global market leadership as a licensor of indexes at the basis of equity ETFs as of June 30. The AUM linked to MSCI indexes represented 19% of all equity ETF industry AUM globally, and $10 billion of net cash inflows that were recorded in this ETFs year-to-date represented 52% of all net cash inflows for the entire equity ETF industry, making MSCI number one, one more time in net cash inflows gathered. For market data investing, non-U.S. equity exposure ETFs that were linked to MSCI indexes were number one in assets and in net cash inflows year-to-date. For the smart beta investing or factor investing as we call it, MSCI index linked Minimum Volatility ETFs were number one in assets and in net cash inflows year-to-date, including the number one ETF globally in all categories for net cash inflows year-to-date. For ESG investing, MSCI index linked ETFs were number one in the number of equity ETFs linked to ESG-themed indexes. So, we are and remain relatively optimistic and proud of the achievement in this area of our business, as exemplified by not only our market leading position and the market based indexes were also in the fast growing areas of smart beta and ESG investing. On slide seven, we highlight a key trend that we are seeing in the market for our Analytics services, and that is the increase of use of factors by hedge funds of all types, quantitative and fundamental hedge funds. Our hedge fund clients are increasingly coming to us with the same problem, how can we help them better explain their performance to their asset owner clients in volatile markets. So, by leveraging our factor model data and our software applications, BarraOne and Barra Portfolio Manager, we are helping hedge fund – our hedge fund clients and our asset owner clients speak the common language of factor performance and factor risk. We're also working with a prime brokerage community to help their hedge fund clients do the same. This is a concrete example where we are able to respond to our client problem and provide the tools necessary to achieve their goals. Lastly, on slide eight, I would like to highlight the work that we're going in environmental, social and governance area or ESG area. ESG is increasingly becoming a very important component of the investment process. Because how companies deal with the environment with their human capital, with their supply chain, and how these companies and their management teams are aligned with the interests of their shareholders, i.e., the governance, is becoming very important for institutional investors all over the world. As a result, ESG represents a very large opportunity for MSCI and it's one of our fastest growing areas in the company, and we have the leading competitive position due to the quality of our research, our data, our ratings, and our software applications. Each of the participants on this slide is driving the integration of ESG into the mainstream of their investment processes. Asset owners are raising the importance of ESG when selecting and monitoring asset managers that they employ. Investment consultants are increasingly using ESG criteria in their manager selection process. Regulators around the world are influencing institutional investors about these non-financial metrics. And given that both asset owners and consultants are placing more emphasis on understanding the ESG risks and opportunities in their portfolios, consequently, asset managers do not want to be left behind on those market share. As a result, asset managers are bringing more ESG products to market to meet the growing demand from investors. So, MSCI is playing a central role support this strength. For example, as 31 of the 88 ESG-themed ETFs globally are based on MSCI indexes and that is up from 12 out of 63 ETFs in 2014. For example, in April, iShares launched an ETF, the iShares Sustainable MSCI Global Impact ETF, that is based on the MSCI ACWI Sustainable Impact Index. The industry's first equity benchmark designed to apply the principle of impact investing by targeting public companies whose products and services aim to address major, social and environmental challenges. As we know, well, one of the fastest growing areas within ESG is the whole topic of low carbon investing. And we are seeing a significant uptick in direct allocations to low carbon strategies by asset owners. So in Europe, one of Sweden's largest pension funds AP4 announced their intention to allocate $3.2 billion to passive funds benchmarked to the MSCI Low Carbon Index family in July. Next in the U.S., one of the largest pension funds just committed to allocate up to $2.5 billion in passive funds benchmarked to the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index. So, on this topic, in summation, our market leading franchise in ESG is helping the investment community face this exciting change and challenge in the investment process. With that summary, let me now pass it on to Kathleen. Kathleen?
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Henry. Let's turn onto slide nine, where I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results. We delivered a very strong Q2 across all these measures as you can see. So, let me walk you through each measure. We delivered a 7.4% increase in revenue, driven primarily by an 8% increase in recurring subscription revenue, and a strong overall revenue growth is despite the market headwind, which caused asset-based fee revenue to decline. There was a negligible impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our subscription revenues. Subscription revenues exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations represented only 21% of our base year-to-date, principally euro, pound and Japanese yen, with pound exposure representing 8% or $36 million of our subscription revenues year-to-date. As a reminder, we do not provide the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our asset-based fees tied to average AUM, of which approximately two-thirds are invested in securities denominated currency other than the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses were down 4% and 5%, respectively on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA expenses both (19:11), reflecting a $2.7 million FX benefit to operating expenses and a $2.5 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA expenses. Expenses that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations represented 42% of adjusted EBITDA expenses year-to-date. The primary currency moves that drove the benefit was the British pound with smaller benefits from the Mexican peso and Indian rupee as well as other currencies. The pound represented 12% of adjusted EBITDA expenses or $35 million. So our expenses saw a net benefit from the recent weakening of the pound. We delivered a 28% increase in operating income and a 24% increase in adjusted EBITDA, resulting in 690 basis point increase in our operating margin and a 660 basis point increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 50.3%. Our effective tax rate was 33.4%, down from 35.9% in the prior year and in line with our guidance as we continue to align our tax structure with our operating footprint. Diluted EPS and adjusted EPS, both increased to 38%. Cash flows were up significantly year-over-year with free cash flow at $104 million versus $12 million last year. This was primarily driven by the timing of cash collections, stronger operating results and lower cash expenses. In summary, this is a very strong quarter despite the market volatility from Brexit. Turning to slide 10, you can see our refinement of full year adjusted EBITDA expense guidance. As you see on the left hand side of the page, you can see the refinement to full year adjusted EBITDA expense guidance reflecting our continuing strong expense management. We now expect to come in at or slightly below the low end of the previously announced range of $600 million to $615 million. On the right hand side of the slide, we're bridging from the annualized first half adjusted EBITDA expenses, so $580.5 million, to the low end of the full-year guidance range, $600 million. The $20 million in incremental expenses that we expect to flow through in the second half will be more weighted to the latter part of the second half as we increase investment. This will consist of new hires and technology, research and sales, investments and initiatives, initiatives like fixed income analytics and technology, mainly higher professional fees and IT expenses. On slide 11, you can see a detailed walk showing its different drivers of EPS growth in Q2. Adjusted EPS increased $0.21 from $0.56 per share to $0.77 per share or 38% in comparison to second quarter 2015. Strong revenue growth contributed $0.11 per share. Operational efficiency both strong expense management and the lower effective tax rate contributed $0.06 per share, and share buybacks benefited EPS as well. We've reduced our average weighed diluted share count by 14% with a partial offset from higher net interest expense resulting in accretion of $0.05 per share. And lastly, FX and other items had a net $0.01 per share negative impact which includes the impact of a $3.7 million charge for estimated losses associated with miscellaneous transactions included in the other expense line partially offset by FX benefit as mentioned earlier. On slide 12 through 13, I'll walk you through our segment results. So let's begin with the Index segment on slides 12 and 13. Revenues for Index increased 9% on a reported basis, driven primarily by an 11% increase in recurring subscription revenue with growth in core products, usage fees and custom, factor and thematic products. We also had a higher non-recurring revenue, primarily due to a payment for the use of our indexes in connection with derivative products. Higher recurring subscription revenue and higher non-recurring revenues were partially offset by lower asset-based fee revenue, which I'll address in a moment. Recurring subscription sales increased 6% year-over-year, driven by higher core module sales. Very strong retention continued in the second quarter at 96%, up slightly from the prior year and in line with first quarter 2016 levels. Index run rate grew by $29 million or 5%. This is the net of an increase in subscription run rate of $35 million or 10% and a $6 million or 3% decrease in asset-based fee run rate due primarily to change in product mix. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Index was 70%, up slightly from the prior year and up from 69.2% in the first quarter. Index delivered high margins while continuing to invest for future growth. Turning to slide 13 now. You have detail on our asset-based fees. Starting with the upper left-hand chart, overall, asset-based fee revenue decreased $2 million or 3% over Q2 2015, driven by a $3 million or 8% decrease in revenue from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, partially offset by some favorability in institutional passive revenue and revenue from exchange traded futures and options contracts. Regarding the biggest component of the change is decrease in revenue from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. This was primarily driven by a decline in the average basis point fee primarily due to, one, market decline in non-US exposures in ETFs linked to MSCI indexes and, two, increased asset flows into lower cost ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. Subsequent to quarter end and as of July 27, AUM and ETFs linked to MSCI indexes have increased to a record $462 billion on quarter-to-date inflows of $6 billion and market appreciation of $16 billion, bringing our third quarter to date average AUM to $451 billion. We've continued to see strong inflows into the iShares, MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF in second quarter 2016, with $2.8 billion in inflows in the quarter and $6.3 billion inflows year-to-date. In the upper right hand chart, we can see that we ended the second quarter with $439.7 billion in period-end ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes, up slightly from the prior year and also versus Q1. Despite the volatility in early 2016 and Brexit in June, our franchise has performed very well. The year-over-year market value decline of $38 billion was more than offset by cash inflows of $42 billion, reflecting the resiliency of our franchise. On slide 14, we have the financials for the Analytics segment. Revenues for Analytics increased 4.5% to $112 million on a reported basis with negligible impact from FX. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher revenues from risk manager, as our clients manage risk across their enterprises and leverage our managed services to obtain operational efficiency. We also had higher equity model revenue driven by our clients' increasing focus on factors resulting in demand for our products that helped them understand and explain performance. Recurring sales were lower compared to the prior year second quarter, due to lower risk manager sales, which offset strong growth in equity models, as we see a challenging environment and seeing some deals taking longer to close. Cancels increased versus the prior year primarily due to market conditions, specifically the continuing cost and budget pressures that our bank clients are experiencing. Retention, however, remained high at 92%. Analytics run rate at June 30 grew by $24 million or 6% to $449 million compared to June 30, 2015, and the impact of FX was not significant. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.6%, up from 19.8% in the prior year and up from 27.5% in the first quarter 2016. The increase in margin was driven primarily by a $7 million or 8% decrease in adjusted EBITDA expenses due to lower compensation and benefits within the technology group, the ongoing improved cost structure of the product area, and higher software capitalization in the quarter compared to the prior year. As we continue to invest in Analytics, we expect the adjusted EBITDA margin to decline from these levels in the second half of the year. And on slide 15, we discuss the All Other segment. Revenues for All Other increased 14% to $26.1 million on a reported basis and grew 15.4% on an FX adjusted basis. First, in terms of ESG, a $2 million or 20% increase in ESG revenue to $11 million was due to strong ESG ratings driven by the increasing integration of ESG into the investment process, as Henry referenced earlier. Real estate revenues increased 10% to $15 million on a reported basis. It would have been up 13%, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the timing of our report deliveries and higher market information product revenue in second quarter 2016. The All Other adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.8%, up from a negative 4.4% in the prior year and 11.4% in first quarter 2016. The increase in the adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by continued strong growth in ESG revenue as well as lower real estate cost primarily due to a reduction in head count and strong cost management. As a result of the seasonality of real estate revenues, which are more weighted to the first half of the year, All Other adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decline from second quarter 2016 levels. On slide 16 now, you have an update of our capital return activity. As you know, we've returned substantial amounts of capital to investors in recent years. More specifically, since 2012, we've returned almost $2 billion through share repurchases and dividends. In Q2, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $75.13 for a total value of $122 million. Approximately $424 million remains on the outstanding repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. On slide 17, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $405 million, which includes $156 million of cash held outside the United States and a domestic cash cushion of approximately $125 million to $150 million, which as a general policy, we maintain for operational purposes. On July 27, the board authorized the company to explore financing alternatives that could increase interest expense and the gross leverage ratio of the company above current levels. We're exploring financing options. However, the occurrence and timing of any such potential financing will be subject to, among other things, market conditions and the company's ability to obtain the terms and conditions authorized by the board. In the event that the company does increase leverage above the stated range, given the strength of our financial model, we expect to quickly delever and return to levels within our stated range. As we begin to explore the possibility of adding incremental leverage, our priority will continue to be maximizing every dollar deployed to ensure we get appropriate return for our shareholders. Our dividend payout ratio dropped slightly below our 30% to 40% payout range based on second quarter results. The board has authorized a 27% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per share or $1.12 per share on an annualized basis. Lastly, on slide 18, we are refining our full year guidance. The only refinement to our guidance as discussed earlier is that for adjusted EBITDA expenses, we now expect to be at or slightly below the low end of the previously announced range of $600 million to $615 million. This guidance assumes among other things that MSCI maintains its current debt levels. Lastly, we continue to work hard toward our long-term targets. So, in summary, we're very pleased with our results for Q2. We executed well throughout the quarter as reflected in the Q2 results. And with that, we'll open the line to take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Good morning.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Just coming back, I guess, to some of the comments on the selling environment and in particular, as it relates to Analytics and the retention coming down there a little bit, the sales being a little bit lower. So can you maybe parse out what you're seeing, is this environmental factors, is this also maybe – over the last couple of years, you've been investing a little bit less. But also you've been talking about maybe raising prices in some areas. So those are couple of things that you've been working on. So, just where is the maybe little bit of the pressure this quarter coming from, if you think about some of those dimension?
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Alex. Thanks for the question. Yeah. So, overall, if you look at the total sales numbers, really nice performance I think for the quarter, but when you look at Analytics, yeah, I would say that's where we're seeing some challenges is the quarter. It is a challenging environment right now. And as you probably know in Analytics, sales can be a little lumpy in that segment. But what we're seeing is that we're seeing banks continuing to be under cost pressure, hedge funds underperforming. So it's a little bit of a challenging environment right now. But that said, we look at the pipeline, and the pipeline is very solid. Deals are taking a little bit longer to close, but we do feel like that pipeline continues to remain solid. And we'll be working to execute on that.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And so some of the moves that you've been making in terms of maybe investing less or asking for more pricing, you don't think that's a driver at all?
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: No. We're not seeing anything with regard to any of the pricing that we've done, causing any cancels or anything like that.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then maybe to my second topic, just real quick on the buyback commentary, maybe you can just flush it out a little bit more just so I understand it right. So you're basically saying you're at 3 times and 3 times to 3.5 times is kind of your range. But did I hear you right that you could explore going a little bit above the range, maybe to 4 times or so to maybe have a little bit more firepower in the near term and then delever from there? And then just generally speaking, how would you all else equal think about the pace of buybacks from here?
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. We are looking at potential additional financing. And we might lever up a little bit higher than the stated range. I wouldn't expect that it would be significantly higher. And I expect that you'd see a pretty quick delevering if you just consider our strong business model and our cash flows. I think we'd delever pretty quickly from there. But again, it would be a pretty slight increase above the stated range.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Henry, I know you've looked at the fixed income arena from time to time. I was hoping to just get an update here on your plans. And just a general comment on whether the M&A market seems attractive at this point in time.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yeah. So, as all of you know, when you look at the entire franchise of MSCI, we're extremely happy and pleased of where we are in all the components of that franchise – the major components of that franchise. And the exception is in fixed income analytics, on both counts, on our desire to continue to be a leader on the strength of fixed income commonalities in the context of multi-asset class analytics, i.e., the component of fixed income in multi-asset class analytics, and then secondly to be a much bigger participant in providing fixed income analytics for fixed income portfolio managers around the world. So with that, we are doing a few things. We are meaningfully investing organically in fixed income analytics, particularly as it relates to some of the changes that are going on in that sector of the industry that provide cash and provide great opportunities for us to do things organically. And then secondly, we are always evaluating the M&A market for these kinds of assets and evaluating them on the basis of what they can do for us. Can they really fit into what we do or not and then decide if it's a good deployment of capital. Regardless of what we do or don't do in any M&A environment, we are extremely focused on – if we deploy capital, getting the rates of return on the capital that we are – that we put to ourselves and with our board. So this is a focus – very much of a focus area clearly for the company as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, and our team to continue to develop it.
Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you for the color there. And we have a question for Kathleen. I believe you're spearheading the creation or optimization of several franchise metrics to better manage the business. Can you just give us an early update on how things are going there so far?
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, I can do that. So maybe I'll step back a little bit and just give you my perspective after being here, not quite three months now. I think it would help to kind of catch my response in that way. So as I said, I've been here almost three months now and as you would expect I've spent most of that time, right, just learning the MSCI model and the organization. And I've been very impressed with the people in the organization, the assets and the really very attractive business model that we have. So I look at this opportunity and say, well, how can I help to take this franchise to the next level. And one of the ways that I can do that is to look at the metrics that we use to run the business and the financial management to run the business. So I'm really looking at reinforcing the rigor with which we make capital decisions and building out the analytics. In particular I think we can do a lot of good work around analytics, around our clients and in the product areas. And there's is a lot of system work that we are in the process of doing, so continuing to implement that system work to enable us to do those analytics to really make the best decisions.
Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right. Thank you for the color and thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Can you give us a sense of how your customers are reacting to purchases of your Analytics products since Brexit? Have you seen any lengthening of the sales cycle, or conversely have you seen an increase in demand in some of the risk products?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yeah. So, first of all, interestingly enough, one of our strongest regions of the world in Analytics sales and retention rates has been EMEA in the last couple of quarters. So that would be contrary to what a lot of people would have expected. And we've done that on the strength of the management team, the sales team in EMEA and very deep engagement with our clients. The softness that we have seen recently was more in Asia-Pacific on the heels of the uncertainties around the Chinese market and the like and a bit of softness recently in the U.S. So what happened also in the quarter was that Analytics sales tend to be very lumpy in the quarter and the second attribute of Analytics sales is that they tend to be very back-ended in the quarter, meaning, the last two weeks of the quarter, typically represent a meaningful percentage of sales. So therefore, given the way Brexit happened which was a week or so before the end of the quarter, quite a lot of our European clients were distracted understanding Brexit and what it meant for them and all of that and therefore the signature that we needed in their contracts did not happen and it was pushed off by a week or so. So therefore, that's a little bit of what you see in the impact on sales. But the pipeline has remained the same. There is not any meaningful items that have been taken out of the pipeline because of Brexit. We're almost like a business as usual after Brexit with respect to the Analytics clients in EMEA and around the world. And we haven't yet seen any meaningful uptick in interest or desire because of Brexit. So it's almost like business as usual, with the only caveat that – in EMEA, right, with the only caveat that distraction that took place one week before the end of the quarter moved the line of certain contracts that we were expecting to close.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And would you expect that the contracts might close in third quarter, or is it still early to tell?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: I think we would expect those to close in the third quarter and the like, now, that's all we are. That's also all sort of encompassed or encapsulated in the also overall context of EMEA, and what the impact that Brexit is having on the banks as an example and obviously some of our sales to banks as you all know well, there is quite a lot of turmoil with some of the German banks, the Italian banks and the like. And therefore, that is yet to be determined what impact if any it has on our sales in that segment in this current quarter. Now, we don't only sell to banks, we sell to asset managers and hedge funds and asset owners, et cetera in EMEA, but obviously, we're closely monitoring what ultimate impact on purchase invitations by banks, how will they be affected by the consequences of Brexit and the volatility that we have seen in the banks.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then my second question really quickly is just on all other margins, really high this quarter, because of the ESG revenue and lower real estate head count. You mentioned it'd be lower in the second half, but there's really a big delta between this quarter and history. So just wondering how we should think about a normal level of margins in all other going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yeah, look, I think, we've tried not – it's very hard to manage through margins, right? We manage through revenues and through EBITDA expenses and capital expenditures. And obviously, with respect to the capital optimization, we do everything we can to reduce the tax rate and the share count, if appropriate, right? So therefore, now, we clearly overshot a little bit with respect to all the margins, right, in the company, and everything went well. But it was understandable because given the volatility – and the huge volatility that you remember took place in the first quarter, we slowed down the pace of hiring and investing in the first quarter, given that we didn't know whether it was going to – we were entering a bear market or whether it was just a nasty correction, which is – it ended up being a nasty correction. And therefore, that hiring machine takes a little bit of time to reenergize. So that affected the second quarter. We are looking to increase the pace of hiring and investing gradually in the second half of the year, not dramatically. Now, with respect to margins, we continue to be very, very comfortable on the longer-term margin targets that we have outlined in the past as a company as a whole, 50% or so. And with respect to the Index business, that's 68% to 72%. The Analytics business in the low to mid-30%s, and the All Other category, which is pretty high now relative to what our targets are, which is 15% to 20%. The issue with the Other segment is we have an expanding margin business in ESG, but it does require investment in order to make it grow at these levels. And then we have the restructuring that is going on in real estate. So we clearly already got to very, very close if not surpassed the levels of margins that we had projected for the longer term, but then you will see a moderation of that, but we are very comfortable in the longer term targets.
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. And I would just – maybe to add to that and concur that we feel comfortable on those long-term margin targets, but a little more color just specifically to your question on All Other and to remind you that we've got a real seasonality impact going on when you look at first half versus second half with regard to real estate within our All Other segment. So, that seasonality impact influences it, as well.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. I know you talked about this in your initial remarks, but maybe you could just frame for us the one or two top areas of savings versus the one or two top areas of investment, first half of the year versus second half of the year, so we get a good understanding of exactly where you're focusing your efforts?
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So, from a savings perspective, if you look at expenses year-over-year, that's basically driving a large part of where the savings come from. And when you think about investment, really across all areas, investing in our product segments, in research, in our coverage organization, and in technology, so it's really doing that smart investing looking across each of the areas and saying, what smart investments can we do to drive future growth. So I think, it's pretty much across the board.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: And importantly, we are purely in indexes is about factor investing. There are other areas, but we clearly are putting a lot of effort there in investing. In Analytics, it's about the new fixed income analytics and the new interface. In ESG and in real estate, it's across the board. And in terms of savings, I just want to emphasize, given the last few years of MSCI, that the – whenever we talk about investing, we are really determined to self-fund this investment plan and not take them out of the target margins, profit margins that we have. And, therefore, we will continue to be extremely focused on looking at our entire cost base and creating efficiencies out of that, reassigning resources, or redeploying resources in order to match them with the best opportunities, and so on and so forth. So, a lot of this talk about investing is – I wanted to be very clear that it's not a philosophy to knock down margins or anything like that at this point. The margin expansion that took place recently was because we had slowed down a bit on that self-funding investment plan, and obviously, we want to correct a bit of that in the second half.
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So as Henry said, the philosophy is not to take the investment out of margin, but to really drive hard on productivity and to think about that every day and to find the opportunities to drive productivity, so we can fund that investment.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. And then I was wondering, is there any way you can frame for us your thoughts on, I guess, passive investment penetration levels and/or opportunity in new offerings? I mean, I guess, the reason why I'm asking is that the market is obviously performing fairly well in the U.S., so that has a positive impact. But I'm wondering what kind of growth rates you think you can generate from those two aspects of the business, just so we get a sense of what the baseline growth rate could be, should there be volatility in any particular quarter from something like Brexit or something else? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yeah. If I understand your question correctly, let me try to answer it in the following way. There is no question that the client base of a company like MSCI is going through some significant challenges from banks in their own balance sheets, from asset management units of banks, wealth management units of banks. So as you know, when banks get into difficulty and they start cutting, it goes across the board, regardless of whether they have great divisions or not, right? So hedge funds are underperforming, so they're pulling in a bit. Active managers are getting hit by passive and smart beta and the like, but we are seeing other opportunities. The non-bank wealth managers around the world are in growth plan. The asset owners are building internal capabilities, in-sourcing asset management. They need a lot of help with our tools. There are geographies around the world that are being very good to us like Canada and parts of the U.S. as well and so on and so forth. So I mean, we have a fairly diversified business. The other thing that is critically important is that we obviously have a bet on bull's-eye, so we have a bet of passive managers and that has done well. And if anything is expanding dramatically from market beta to a smart beta, to ESG beta so to speak and thematic beta, so we're capturing that significant opportunity. And we're also helping in whichever way we can the active managers deal with all these changes and the dialog with them is incredible, because they need us more than ever in that whole process. So, we got a fairly wide and diversified product line that – and our franchise is increasing dramatically. I mean the dialog we have with the C level of our clients today compared to a year ago or two years ago or three years ago or four years ago is exponentially bigger, and they are looking for answers, they are looking for solutions, they are looking for ways to – for them to launch new products and increase revenues and create their own operational efficiencies and meet regulatory demands and all of that. So our franchise is great and really great in all this, but in the context of clearly a challenging end client – a changing end client environment we're very optimistic that we can continue to grow at this levels. Clearly, we would like to accelerate them if we can, but it's – we were where we want to be in this whole thing.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Given the expense guidance is weighted more towards Q4, can you maybe at a high level help us think through how we should consider constant currency expense growth in 2017? Are we talking more kind of low-single-digits or mid-single-digits?
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. We'll be working through our 2017 expense guidance as we go through our annual budget process. So, at that point in time, I think we'd be prepared to give you better color on that.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on the increase in the leverage, just curious why you're considering increasing the leverage at this point? Is it that you have desire to buyback stock at a pace faster than your cash flow generation or is it fair to read that maybe you have a greater desire to have more optionality on the acquisition front?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Well, Chris, it's actually driven by the market conditions in the high yield market. They are exceptionally strong for actuaries (57:50) like ours. As you know, there is always a big flight to quality in that market. Rates have come down and spreads have been – are attractive. There is a significant appetite for high quality paper like ours that gives them higher yields on sovereign bonds around the world. So, we are extremely opportunistic. We don't have to do anything. But if the right conditions are there, we will want to do it. And that's why Kathleen commented that, if we get exceptional demand, if we go to the market which is not clear, but if we see exceptional demand at fairly low yields, we may want to do a bit more than we would normally do, and therefore, maybe go a bit higher than 3.5 times leverage. But that's what is driving us in order to relever to the desired levels. And then the flip side of it is, okay, what are you going to do with the proceeds? And I think it's the same as always, organic growth, which is already funded by the current cash flows, it will be buybacks, and if there are opportunities in the M&A market, we will do that. But we're not doing this, because we are gearing ourselves to do any acquisition, it's just being opportunistic.
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. And this is pretty consistent with what we've done in the past, right. As leverage came down, we then look to lever up again, right? We were at 3.7 times after we did the debt offering in August 2015. And then, as you can see, we brought the leverage ratio right back down again after that.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: I think, a big part of this thing is we want to deliver on the promise that we have made which is, we said we will be 3 times to 3.5 times gross leverage. If we delever, we want to get back into that range. We clearly want to do it opportunistically, not automatically. If yields were really high, we'd want to wait to do that, but if the yields are attractive, we want to get back to there, and therefore be a consistent communicator of our policies and messages.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And I know, I want to sneak one more in here if you don't mind. You talked about the need to continue to invest in Analytics as you've been saying for a while. But at the same time saying comp in the Analytics tech group was down. So, help us reconcile those two items.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yeah. I think the comps that we're talking about in the Analytics is just simply we focus intensely on the head count there on the projects and which areas, so we ended up – the team in Analytics ended up reprioritizing projects, reprioritizing head count where the head count should be located and that had a impact in compensation expense, not individual, clearly compensation. So, it was a big effort in continuing to make sure that all of our expenses in Analytics, including the head count, is completely focused on the right projects that have the highest capital return, the highest impact and the like, and not be involved in a lot of other things that may have much longer payback or lower payback. So, that's a big effort of what we did. And that has allowed us to increase the margin and at the same time, fund new initiatives, including this fixed income analytics initiative which we're not planning to – when we started with the budget at the beginning of the year, we had not put that into our budget and the opportunity came up given the changes in that space, and we are self-funding that increase in investment in fixed income analytics out of all those efficiencies.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions for you. I guess the first one, you guys announced the disposition of the Global Occupiers business in June to Jones Lang LaSalle. Can you provide a little more color on the size of that business and what it means perhaps going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: Yeah. It's a relatively small business within real estate, right, it's in real estate and relatively small. But importantly, it was a business whose client base were corporate in which we were helping them optimize their facilities footprint. And we remain extremely focused on MSCI in which we say, our client base are institutional investors and their advisors, and not sort of the corporate. If it is a corporate, the pension fund of a corporate, for example, the treasury of a corporate. And therefore, we have no business being in that part of the space. So, we therefore decided that that segment of the product line in real state was better off housed in another organization that will buy it that will then make better use of it.
Kathleen A. Winters - Chief Financial Officer: And Keith, that business was a very small business as part of our portfolio, quite immaterial in the scheme of things.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Got you. And then the next question for you is that non-recurring revenue over the past three quarters has been up substantially over, I guess, the prior year, sort of like 30%. How should we think about non-recurring revenue going forward? Is that kind of focus of yours to grew more of that through one-off projects or how should we think about that going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: I'm sorry, can you repeat what kind of revenues you were referring to?
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Your non-recurring revenue.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director: The non-recurring revenue. Yeah. So, we have very much focused on every dollar of revenue. There was a little bit of bias in the past of focusing on only recurring revenue and not as much as what we call one-time revenue, which is actually most of the revenue for everyone else in the world. So, we reenergized our goals and objectives with the coverage team to make sure that sure that we were focused on every dollar or every pound, every euro of revenue anywhere else in the world. And therefore, this has resulted on higher, what we call, one-time or non-recurring revenues in the company. They are very lumpy, obviously. So of course, we'll be more – some quarters will be less and the like. But there is a significant effort to ensure that we get everything that is worth for our financial model.
Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson for closing remarks.
Stephen C. Davidson - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you very much, everyone, for your interest in MSCI and have a great afternoon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Kevin. Good day and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the quarter. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they were made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the Risk Factors on forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 28 to 32 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Qutub, Chief Financial Officer and Rich Napolitano, Principal Accounting Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thanks, Steve and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Before I going into prepared remarks, a couple of programing notes. This was supposed to be Bob Qutub's last earnings call, but unfortunately he has developed severe back issues. So he's not able to deliver his prepared remarks, but Bob is joining on us on the line. Bob?
Bob Qutub : Thanks Henry. I can say I've never had back issues in my life and I'll tell you what, I hope I never have them again. But I really wanted be on this final call and say thanks for the opportunity to work with all of you on the call. It's been an honor to be a part of this fantastic journey that MSCI is on and I'm really looking forward to the following successes to come. I'll miss the team at MSCI but I'll tell you what, I'm really looking forward to spending more time with my family, without the back pain I hope. Henry?
A - Henry Fernandez: Thanks, Bob and continued best wishes for recovery on a speedy basis. Given Bob's painful injury, Rich Napolitano, our Principle Accounting Officer, will deliver Bob's prepared remarks. For the Q&A session, we'll have Rich and our colleague, Andy Wichmann, who heads up our Corporate Development and Financial Planning and Analysis Group. I will leverage on both of them in responding to your questions, and if there are any specific questions for Bob, he will continue to be on the phone line. As all of you know, Bob announced his retirement several months ago, and since then, we have been in the process of recruiting his successor. I would like to thank Bob for his many contributions to MSCI during what was a period of tremendous growth and change for the Company. After a successful conclusion to this process, I am pleased to introduce Kathleen Winters, who will be joining MSCI as our new CFO officially this Monday, May 2. The press release went out last night, and I thought it would be great to introduce Kathleen, who's here with us this morning to this important group and have her say a few words. Kathleen?
Kathleen Winters: Thanks, Henry. This is a very exciting time for MSCI as the firm continues to expand and grow its products. I look forward to joining the firm's leadership team Monday, and I look forward to meeting and working with all of you on the call as well. Thank you.
Henry Fernandez: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome aboard. Hopefully, another fantastic journey like the one Bob had. Let us now turn to the results. I am pleased to share with you our first quarter 2016 financial results, that build on the strong momentum we established coming out of 2015. In my opening remarks, I will walk you through how we executed our strategy in the first quarter, which resulted in growing revenues, making us more operationally efficient and optimizing our capital base. I will provide a strategic update on each of our product segments and provide you with a sense of where we are in the cycle of investing for growth and profitability. Then given the market volatility we saw during the quarter, I will highlight how we are leveraging our research enhanced content at MSCI to create new analytic services that help our clients manage their portfolios through volatile times. I will walk you through a couple of slides that show the resiliency of our recurring subscription revenues and the resiliency of inflows into ETFs linked to MSCI indices. I will then conclude my remarks with an update on our capital return efforts and the underpinnings of our capital allocation strategy. Let's turn to Slide 3 for a review of our financial results; a 6% increase in revenue, driven by double-digit growth in Index recurring subscriptions and accompanied by a 6% decline in adjusted EBITDA expenses, drove a 24% increase in adjusted EBITDA. These strong operating results, combined with a lower effective tax rate and a large number of share repurchases drove a 36% increase in adjusted EPS. First, let's talk a little bit about revenue growth. Our top line growth was dampened by the market volatility in the quarter, which led obviously to a decline in equity values, and therefore AUMs of ETF linked to MSCI indices. It also dampened -- the top line growth was also dampened by the timing of revenues in our Analytics product line, which we expect to be mitigated in the coming quarters. We are continuing to invest and innovate across MSCI by leveraging the research enhanced content we have, and creating new ones that we can leverage to create new products and services and incremental layers of revenue growth. Turning to operational efficiency, we are relentless in our focus on ensuring that our cost base is right-sized and aligned with the most attractive investment opportunities. We are gaining greater visibility and insight into the drivers of our cost base through our new segment reporting, our new activity costs and a large number of new operating and financial metrics that we are developing. For example, we're working hard to further break down our regional profitability, and we're looking to analyze our sales to gain insight into client profitability and client behavior. One of the byproducts of this initiative will be a more granular view, for example of pricing or price increases and volume in our sales. As a result of these efforts so far, on the new initiatives, we believe that we're well positioned to achieve incremental operational efficiencies, while at the same time, maximizing growth. Our tax planning work is on track to deliver further improvement in our operating tax rate in the quarters ahead. Finally, in terms of capital optimization, we took advantage of the significant volatility in our stock price in the quarter to repurchase 4.9 million shares at an average price of $68.45 for an aggregate amount of $333 million. On Slide 4, we show how we delivered in the first quarter against our areas of focus in 2016. In our Index product segment, we are hitting on all cylinders, with strong execution against all the key opportunities in 2016. The one area where the metrics were not favorable was the equity market, which was obviously out of our control, but it has since recovered, since the volatility in the first quarter. In Analytics, we're launching new products and services and we are keenly focusing on profitability, while at the same time continuing to invest for growth. Price increases in the Analytics product line are having a positive impact on sales. At the same time, our retention rates are quite strong at 95%. Lastly, in our All Other segment, in ESG in particular, a strong 20% plus revenue growth continues to be driven by the integration of ESG into the investment processes of mainstream asset managers. And in real estate, the work that we have done so far over the past few quarters is improving the performance of this product line with the transformation of the products and services and the launch of a new real estate analytics forum. On slide 5, we highlight where we are in terms of the cycle of investing for growth versus profitability. As our overall operating profit margins have expanded due to continued solid revenue growth and improved profitability in Analytics, we are continuing to invest and innovate to drive future growth. Our long-term targets for the Company and each of the segments reflect a balanced level of investment that allow us to continue to innovate and sell our products and services and at the same time, continue to deliver higher profitability to our shareholders. While we'll increase investment for the remainder of 2016 relative to the quarterly run rate of the first quarter, we're also focused on profitability as reflected in the lowering of our full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA expense range. On Slide 6, we highlight just one example here of how we are innovating in Analytics to help our clients manage their portfolios through volatile times and market dislocations. We are continuing to address this client problem by generating research, models, mythologies that helps our clients think through the solutions to this problem that they are facing. Then we take this research and the accompanying models and mythologies and commercializing it by creating new services like, for example, the macroeconomic stress testing that we launched in the quarter which lets our client stress test their portfolios for events like a Fed tightening or a China slowdown or a downdraft in commodity prices, et cetera. It is because of innovations like this that MSCI was awarded Best Sell-Side Market Risk Product for RiskManager in the 2016 Waters Technology Awards. Please turn to Slide 7, where we highlight the resiliency of our recurring subscription model. We did build some analysis here to help you think through this and the conclusion that we've reached is that the larger our clients get in terms of run rate with us, the secure they get. So when we gone through periods of significant volatility, we would expect high retention from our larger clients, which is the majority of our run rate and lower retention sometimes from the smaller clients that make up say less than 10% of our overall subscription run rate. Not a bad position to be in and of course, as we develop and deepen our penetration with the larger clients, hopefully, this virtuous circle will continue. The challenging start to 2016 dampened the growth rate of our asset based fees as highlighted on Slide 8 by the daily progression of ETF AUMs linked to MSCI indices. As this slide shows, it is the journey that counts, not the beginning point or the end point. Our revenues from the indices we licensed to ETF providers are based on the average of daily AUM over the course of each quarter. This chart illustrates how the daily AUM levels compared to the average of those daily AUM levels during the quarter -- during Q1 and through all the way to April 26. Due to the significant decline and subsequent recovery of daily AUM during the quarter, the average daily AUM for Q1 is lower -- meaningfully lower than the starting level and the end level. Fortunately, given the recovery of the equity markets and the continued inflow into ETF linked to MSCI indices, in Q2 so far, our average daily AUM level is up significantly compared to Q1. On Slide 9, we highlight the resiliency of these inflows into ETFs linked to MSCI indices. We've done another amount of sharp work here to understand the behavior of this. Growth in revenue from the indices that we licensed to the ETF providers have been pretty resilient in periods of marketing decline because ETFs linked to MSCI indices have consistently capture positive cash flows, and the magnitude of those Cash flows has far outweighed the negative impact from market declines. This chart illustrates the impact that cash flows and market movements on AUM in those ETFs linked to MSCI indices since 2012 and through the first quarter of 2016. ETFs linked to MSCI indices have captured positive cash flows in 15 out of the 17 quarters since 2012, including five out of the seven quarters when the impact from market movement was negative and in some cases, rather negative. As measured by dollars, the net impact from cash flows was 15 times greater than the net impact from market movement since 2012 or about $221 billion compared to $15 billion. This strong trend can be attributed to the overall growth, secular growth of the equity ETF market combined with the strength of our indices, our brand, our client support, our relationship with ETF providers and of course, the investment pattern of our clients. On slide 10, we have an update on our capital return efforts. Now that we have paid incentive compensation and taxes in the first quarter and excluding the upcoming dividend, we have approximately $200 million in excess cash. We have delivered on our commitment to not store excess capital and as our cash balances have declined to more normal operating levels, we now have even more flexibility to be more opportunistic and discerning with our share repurchases. We expect to repurchase more shares on lower prices and less at higher prices, as we have done before with a little more discerning to that effect. Capital deployment is a dynamic process that is constantly being evaluated with our Board against various competing users. As we begin to explore the possibility of adding incremental leverage, given our natural de-leveraging as we grow, and given our target of gross leverage of 3.0 times to 3.5 times, we want to ensure that we maximize every dollar deployed and that we get an approximate return -- an appropriate return and a high return for our shareholders on those dollars, all of which way above our cost of capital. Given all of this, please turn to slide 11, where we try to highlight the hierarchy of uses of capital that support our capital allocation framework. Our first dollar typically goes to a high return organic investment, followed by some inorganic investment if they exist, principally small bolt-on acquisitions if they provide high returns. Next, we look at returning capital to our shareholders through the most efficient and accretive method and lastly, we examine a time to repayment of debt if necessary or if appropriate given the cycles. Our Board of Directors is keenly focused on this capital allocation framework to ensure we achieve the highest return on our capital and equally the most optimal amount of capital base to support our business. So, with all of that, I like to now pass it on to Rich Napolitano, who'll be stepping in for Bob.
Rich Napolitano: Thank you, Henry. Please turn to slide 13, where I will begin my overview of our financial results. Our results this quarter were solid, with a 6% increase in revenue and a 6% decline in adjusted EBITDA expenses, driving a 24% increase in adjusted EBITDA and 680 basis point increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin of 47.8%. Again, as a reminder, in the slides that follow, we provide the impact of foreign currency fluctuation on our subscription revenue and cost, but we do not provide the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our asset based [indiscernible] average AUM of which approximately two-thirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. On Slide 14, we showed a positive impact on our adjusted EPS from the various levers we're pulling to create value for our shareholders. Adjusted EPS increased $0.18 or 36% compared to the first quarter 2015. First, in terms of core growth, our subscription revenues coupled with more muted ETF revenue growth as a result of the decline in equity values at the beginning of 2016 benefited EPS by $0.10 per share. Turning to operational efficiency, strong expense management and a lower effective tax rate contributed $0.05 per share. In terms of capital, the adjusted EPS benefit from share repurchases was partially offset by higher net interest expense but resulted in accretion of $0.02 per share. And lastly, FX contributed about $0.02 to adjusted EPS, again, excluding the impact of FX on our AUM. On Slide 15, we provide you with a bridge for the year-over-year change in our revenues by segment and by revenue type. Total revenues increased $16 million or 6% to $279 million year-over-year, driven by an increase of $13 million or 6% in recurring subscription revenues principally due to a 10% increase in index recurring subscription revenue and an increase of $3 million or 6% in asset-based fees. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on the recurring subscription revenues. Turning to Slide 16, we provide you with the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA expense bridge. Overall, the combination of a 5% reduction in headcount, a $3 million non-cash charge in the prior year and strong expense management drove the year-over-year decline in our adjusted EBITDA expenses. First quarter adjusted EBITDA expenses increased $9 million or 6% to $146 million and decreased slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2015. Excluding a $4 million benefit from foreign currency exchange fluctuations, our adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased $6 million or 4% year-over-year. As shown in the upper chart, the non-cash charge in the prior year was a significant driver of the year-over-year decline and is reflected in lower research and development cost which we have shown in the lower chart. While total research and development costs was down, we continue to invest in areas to support our growth strategy. The $7 million decline in cost of revenues was broad-based across client service and consultant, technology, data services, product management and research functions. On a linked quarter basis, costs were relatively flat as a reduction in technology related professional fees, stock-based compensation and severance mostly offset first quarter seasonal increases in compensation and benefits. On Slide 17, we provide you the run rate bridge for the quarter. Our reported run rate increased 8% to $1.1 billion, consisting of a 9% increase in subscription run rate to $913 million, and a 5% increase in ABF run rate to $199 million. Over the past two quarters, we've been encouraged by the higher levels of new recurring subscription sales as well as higher non-recurring sales, which has generated significantly higher levels of gross sales. Strong recurring subscription sales, combined with lower cancels resulted in net new recurring sales of $20 million in the quarter, which is the highest level since 2009. Our aggregate retention rate was a record 95% across MSCI in the quarter. While it is too early to call a change in the trend, we believe that many of our sales initiatives are beginning to take hold. So we are cautiously optimistic in the outlook. On Slides 18 through 22, I will walk you through our segment results. Let's begin with the Index segments on Slide 18. Revenues for Index increased 8% on a reported basis. The double-digit increase in recurring subscription revenue in the quarter was driven by strong double-digit growth in revenue from developed and emerging markets small cap modules and from our innovative custom, factor, thematic and ESG-based products. The adjusted margin -- EBITDA margin for Index was 69% compared to 70% in the prior year, and 69% in the fourth quarter, which was in line with the guidance we provided on the fourth quarter earnings conference call. The decline in margin year-over-year was driven by higher research and development, selling and marketing, as well as general and administrative costs. Index recurring subscription sales increased 14%, driven by strong core benchmarking products. Cancels were in line with our expectations, and we recorded very strong retention of 96%, just below the record 97% we set in the prior year. On Slide 19, we provide you with our leadership position as an index provider to the ETF market in the first quarter. On Slide 20, we provide you with detail around our asset based fees. Challenging market conditions early in the quarter dampened the growth of average ETF AUM linked to our indices, but this headwind reversed by the end of March, and we ended the quarter at $438 billion in AUM with inflows of $7 billion in the quarter, which we show in the upper right chart. Turning to the upper left chart, overall asset-based fee revenue increased $3 million or 6% driven by a $2 million or 20% increase in institutional passive revenue, as well as a $500,000 increase in revenue and a 47% increase in exchange traded future and option contracts based on our indices. Average AUM and ETFs linked to our indices increased $15 billion year-over-year or 4% but that increase was offset by a 4% decline in the average basis point fee as indicated in the lower right chart. The decline in the average basis point fee year-over-year was driven by mix due to the movement away from higher emerging market products to lower fee developed market products, including the U.S., which we show on the lower left chart, as well as a product mix within the developed market funds to lower fee products. On a linked-quarter, asset-based fee revenue declined approximately $2 million or 3% driven by a $2 million or 5% decline in ETF revenue. This was partially offset by modestly higher revenue from institutional passive and exchange traded future and options linked to our indices. Subsequent to quarter-end and as of April 26, AUM and ETFs linked to our MSCI indices have increased to $450 billion on inflows of $3 billion and market appreciation of $9 billion, which brings the second quarter to date average to $441 billion for AUM. We have continued to see strong inflows into high shares MSCI USA minimum volatility. On Slide 21, we highlight the financials in the Analytics segment. Revenues for Analytics increased 3% on a reported basis and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28% compared to 13% from the prior year quarter. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher RiskManager, equity models, WealthBench, and InvestorForce products. While revenue grew 3%, run rate grew 7% year-over-year with the divergence reflecting when sales were booked and recorded in run rate versus when recognizing in revenue. This divergence between revenue and run rate should close in the quarters ahead. The dramatic increase in margin year-over-year was driven by a 14% decrease in adjusted EBITDA expenses as the product area continues to transform and improve profitability, while at the same time investing in future growth opportunities. The margin was higher than guided on the fourth quarter call due to decreases in non-compensation expenses, which more than offset seasonal increases in compensation and benefits. While new recurring sales were soft during the quarter, driven by lower RiskManager and equity model sales, lower cancels more than offset the decline in recurring sales and retention increased to 95%, up from 93% in the prior year. And lastly, for our segments, turning to Slide 22, we have the all other segment. Revenues for all other increased 7% to $24 million on a reported basis and grew 9% on an FX adjusted basis and adjusted EBITDA margin turned positive at 11%. First, in terms of ESG, $2 million or 21% increase in ESG revenue to $11 million was due to strong sales, driven by the increasing integration of ESG into our investment process, as Henry has mentioned, with approximately 40% of the sales coming from new clients. Run rate growth of 22% was driven primarily by growth in ESG ratings, with particularly strong growth in ESG ratings in the Americas, which grew 39%. Turning to real estate, a tough year-over-year comparison due to the early delivery of our PAS flagship reports in the prior year, partially was offset by higher market information, product revenue in the current quarter, resulting in a slight decline in revenue to $13 million. Excluding the impact of FX, real estate revenue would have increased 1%, compared to the first quarter last year. In the quarters ahead, we anticipate that the performance of real estate should continue to improve, reflecting our restructuring effort and the launch of our real estate analytics portal. On slide 23, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $445 million which includes $126 million in cash held outside the United States and a domestic cash cushion of approximately a $125 million to $150 million, which as a general policy, we maintain for operational purposes. Free cash flow in the quarter of $28 million was below prior year levels due to the timing of collections and higher interest payments and the decline compared to the fourth quarter was primarily due to the seasonal payment of our annual incentive compensation and bonus. On Slide 24, we highlight the progression of our full year 2016 adjusted EBTIDA expense range. We now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA expenses to come in between $600 million and $615 million, down from a range of $610 million to $625 million. $3 million of that $10 million decline in the range was due to positive currency moves, but $7 million is from savings from general expense management and corporate efficiency efforts. We expect that higher adjusted EBITDA expenses, principally from technology related professional fees and information technology costs will flow through in the back half of 2016. With the introduction of our segments and activity costing, we are beginning to acquire better visibility into our expense base, and opportunities to become more efficient are being identified. On Slide 25, we'd like to reiterate our guidance for full-year 2016, with the only change being our full-year adjusted EBITDA expense range, which I just discussed. Lastly, we continue to work hard toward our long-term targets, and with that, we'd like to open up the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alex Kramm: Wanted to talk about the sales, and in particular, as it relates to pricing, I think in the last quarter, you alluded to the fact that in particular on the risk side, you were starting to take pricing for the first time in a while. Meanwhile, though the environment has certainly gotten a lot tougher, right? So just wondering how those pricing discussions have gone. If you're seeing some of the impact already reflected here, or if there is more to come and obviously, how much push back you're getting from [indiscernible] 
Henry Fernandez: Yes, so definitely, we're on a journey to better match the pricing of our Analytics product line to the value that we believe we're providing to our clients and we've rolled out price increases pretty much across the board. Those discussions are going relatively well. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more for things and therefore, there's always an element of that but they're going pretty well. We're making sure they go through and we're discussing with our clients and there is no -- we don't identify any fear or cancels at this point because of that and people are beginning to understand that we got to invest in the product line, we got to do more things and we got to become more profitable as well. So, they're going well and there is a little of that being reflected with first quarter. I will say maybe 20% to 25% of the sales in the quarter are price increases at this point and we are going to continue to see that going through throughout the year.
Alex Kramm: Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just secondly, on the tax rate, you talked about continued efforts to bring that down. Can you just give us an update where you stand on that and maybe as part of the answer, there obviously has been some new guidance recently from the Treasury Department around all the earnings stripping and things like that, that's going on. Is that going to hinder some of your journey there or you think you can still bring that tax rate down materially with maybe some of the new rules here?
Rich Napolitano: We are looking very closely at the new rules that are being proposed. At this point, we are still standing firm with our guidance of 33% and 34% in our plant for this year, but at this point, we don't see this is going to materially change our goals.
Alex Kramm: But in terms of goals longer term, any -- I think you've done a ton of work for where you could go over the next couple of years. Is that going to change anything or too early to tell?
Henry Fernandez: Well, I think at the point now, we definitely would expect a gradual decline in the tax rate as we continue to do the work and execute on it. We've gone through a progression of a -- we have initially a cost plus model. We executed at the end of last year a process in which we're shifting the profits to better represent where the activity is being performed across the world, and that has benefited us so far. Ultimately, we want to go something that is called principal-hub model, and that is probably at this point not going to be implemented until the end of this year, and that would help us lower the tax rate further. That's what we're looking to do and obviously, operationally, it's quite a lot of work to achieve all of that and the current set of regulations by the Treasury doesn't seem to affect us at all, but you never know when new things get thrown at us by any one of the taxing authorities around the world.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair.
Chris Shutler: On Slide 5, guys, that's where you're talking about striking the right balance and investing in margin with Q1 being tactical. So just curious on -- in the back half of the year, where will spending go up and can you be a little bit more specific, I think you mentioned professional IT costs, but what exactly will you be spending on that would drive expenses higher? And will it be offset by other things that you have in the works?
Henry Fernandez: Well, the first quarter was a tad unusual in which when you see the average $145.7 million here, because we started the year with a lot of our budget and lot of our plans for continued investments and balancing out profitability versus investments. Now during the volatility that took place in the market, at some point in the quarter, we decided to slow down certain investments because we didn't know like most people whether we were in a bear market -- the beginnings of a bear market or whether it was just a nasty correction and we didn't want to be stranded with a lot of high cost if it was a protracted bear market for the balance of 2016. So we slowed down a few things. Some of them, for example, in the Index coverage efforts and things like that. So now that the market has recovered, we want to step up a little bit of that but within the target of profitability that we talked about. None of this is in any way, shape or form to dampen significantly or meaningfully our profit margins that we have for the year, but some of that needs to come back up. So there'll be investments in coverage, sales people, client service, consultant. There will be investment in the back-end in technology. If you see, for example, capital expenditures, the average in the quarter was low. We need to step that up in order to achieve the targets we wanted to achieve. There are similar -- there have been similar declines in operating expenses in technology that we need to get back on track, but again, I want to emphasize that this back-end -- and none of that will necessarily happen in the second quarter by the way. Second quarter may end up being not largely dissimilar to the first quarter, but we got to step it up at some point in order to continue to invest for future growth in the Company in product management, in some of the technology efforts and in data efforts and in coverage.
Chris Shutler: Okay, thanks. And then a question on fixed income capabilities and within kind of the old -- what used to be the old RMA and also Index, I think the thought for a while used to be that MSCI was a likely acquirer to build up your fixed income capabilities. Obviously, that hasn't transpired. So maybe just talk about your efforts to build out a more comprehensive fixed income offering as part of the multi-asset class solutions you're offering, and is that as important a goal today as it was a couple years ago for MSCI?
Henry Fernandez: I think it's more important today than it was in the past. Underneath some of this efforts that you see in Analytics -- in the Analytics product line, there is a meaningful amount of investment that is going on, on both -- the new architecture and interface that we've talked about, which we continue to develop and showcase it with clients. We haven't started really selling it, but we're beta testing it and things like that. And importantly, a meaningful amount of investment in fixed income analytics, both for multi-asset class risk, performance and for portfolio management in fixed income -- in purely fixed income portfolios, we spend an inordinate amount of time since December in consultations with key clients around the world. I think we've done 50 or so consultations, as to what they would like to see in fixed income portfolio management and analytics, in our offering and therefore what investments we should do. So that continues -- the way we have funded that has been by a relentless effort through look and re-look, and re-look at the cost base of analytics, and the prioritizing were longer-term and maybe they have a [indiscernible] by reassigning and reallocating and creating efficiencies, and the like in order to make room for these two meaningful investments in the product line, which is the newer technology platform, the new software platform that we'll overlay on top of RiskManager and BarraOne and TTM [ph] and secondly, the newer initiative is fixed income analytics, and we are heavily invested in that area in the context of these financials. So I think the team in the average phones has done a marvelous job of trying to keep sales high if we can, retentions high, hammering and hammering at the cost structure and making room for investments, while we keep increased profit margin.
Chris Shutler: Last one, quick one. Henry, you called out earlier kind of rough 20% to 25% of sales or price increases. Is that specific to analytics or the business overall and could you compare that to a year ago?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, look, that is roughly -- it's all Analytics. That comment was all on Analytics across the board. We no longer make a distinction; the old distinction that we have between RMA and PMA and all that, because we're trying to comingle all of it into a front to back offering of portfolio management and risk management. So, it's all analytics across. As you may remember, we had started taking steps to increase prices in portfolio management analytics, equity portfolio management analytics a couple of years ago and we continued a bit last year on a smaller run rate of the overall PMA product line. What we're now attacking in a big way is what is the right pricing which has led to price increases versus the value of the multi-asset class portfolio analytics, and therefore RiskManager and BarraOne, managed services and all of that, and that's what we are rolling out and that was the comments I made at the beginning of the Q&A, of course.
Chris Shutler: How did 20% to 25% compare to a year ago in the analytic segment? So if you're at $12.4 million of recurring sales this is the first quarter, $13.5 million last first quarter?
Henry Fernandez: No, it's much higher, much higher than first quarter last year. The comment I've just made, right, if you look at the price increases we are doing on the old PMA run rate was $100 plus million. With the analytics, the multi-asset class run rate was $300 million plus. So those selected price increases that were on PMA don't compare to the price increases in aggregate dollar to the price increases we're doing in the all multi-asset class risk analytics.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugh Miller with Macquarie.
Hugh Miller: I had a question. As we look at the success that you guys have had with the margin growth in the other segment, obviously still below the longer term or medium to longer-term target of 15% to 20%, but as we consider the returns in ESG versus real estate, how should we be thinking about product mix in those categories? Is one product meaningfully more profitable than the other?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, surely. At this point, that segment All Other, is composed of two product lines, the ESG product line and the real estate product line. The ESG product line is red hot. It's -- as Rich indicated, revenues grew 21% from first quarter last year. Run rate grew 22%. We are capitalizing enormously on the relationships that MSCI -- the old parts of the MSCI have with the big mainstream asset managers in order to penetrate -- to have this product be penetrated in those main stream asset managers as they are beginning to look at investing on the basis of ESG criteria. So that has doing well. The profitability of that product line has increased meaningfully. It was losing money two, three years ago. We got to breakeven a couple of years ago and now it's got a little bit of a profit margin. I think the trade-off there on ESG is that [indiscernible] to invest, this is a very large opportunity in the world, and you got to invest in products, you got to invest in coverage, in sales and so on and so forth. So that's the trade-off we try to do. So we want to do in a discipline way. So we've asked the team to show up with more profitability. It's a good discipline and create more operational efficiencies so that we continue to reinvest back into the product line. Now real estate is in a different state of development, which is when we bought this business, we knew we needed to do a radical surgery to it in order to prepare it for global foot print in a global expansion and all of that. We needed to revamp the product line, automated data processes, create new technology, create better delivery systems to our clients through this new real estate portal and the like, relocate the vast majority of the staff from the UK to emerging market, especially India, major transformation of that product line. And I think we probably have the worst order in that process and in terms of the financials and now we'll continue to see improvement. The product line got obviously hit by the fact that a lot of the sales are in pounds because this originally was largely a UK business. So those translated into dollars. So meaningful a decline in growth rates, but they continued to grow and the profitability has increased dramatically from a loss to a little bit of a profit, hopefully this year and we want to continue on that growth. So as I said before, one of our goals across the Company is to maintain the profitability that we have in Index, was to increase significantly the profitability of analytics which we have achieved and obviously have more work to do, and this incubator of new businesses and new product lines with the All Other segment, to get it to a position that it contributes meaningfully to the profit margin of the Company, but we got to be realistic that this is an area where investment is needed and therefore we're going to overweight investment versus profitability, we'll see better profitability, but it's not going to yet get to levels similar to the other businesses.
Hugh Miller: That's helpful. Thank you very much. And I guess, as we think about operational efficiency, obviously, you guys have made great strides in automating process and limiting growth in headcount, but we've also seen a shift towards headcount in emerging markets. I think it's up to 53% of the total versus closer to 50% a year ago. Should we continue to see that happening? Do you have a target in the next maybe three to five years as the amount of headcount you'll probably see in emerging markets relative to developed?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, we definitely want to continue on all of the above for sure. I think, at this point, you'll see that EMC, DMC split continue to inch upward. Not yet clear where the targets are. Obviously, we're pushing as hard as we can to make it higher. I think once you start getting into the 60s, you may starting get into the limit and a lot it is because you're going to have a lot of -- a lot of our senior product people, our coverage people, our consultants in big financial centers of the world, which is where our biggest clients are, in New York, London, Boston, Chicago, the major European capitals, and Tokyo, Hong Kong, all centers that obviously are more expensive than in emerging market, and that makes -- you get our people there and a lot of people in order to serve as a client base. So that's where we are. Now importantly, take this opportunity to say that a lot of -- in the last two, three years, we embarked on a process of really pulling out as many metrics, operating metrics, financial metrics, putting the financial software systems to be able to automate those and then hire finance directors that we couple with business people and engrain that in the culture, so that the whole Company is being managed by metrics, by daily metrics, financial metrics, operating metrics and all of that. We're in a journey. We're probably a third of the way in that journey and that's why the comments that I made and the comment that Rich made is that it makes us cautiously optimistic that as we develop deeper and deeper metrics, that the -- that's going to help us make better understanding of the cost and how to squeeze it, it's going to be better understanding of profitability and how to go to the places where its higher, how do we understand the value proposition to our client versus the pricing and so on and so forth, and therefore makes us hopeful that this operational efficiency will continue, this increase in revenues will continue from being smart about how you allocate it and on top of that, the investments in new products.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Focusing on the asset-based fee business for a second, you highlighted that the fee rate ticked down because of the mix shift between EM and developed. So just putting that aside, in terms of contract renewals in that business, can you talk directionally about how the fee rate is trending? And also, have you been gaining market share of U.S. flows or was it more market-driven and is gaining U.S. flows a strategic priority right now?
Henry Fernandez: So, one, the sort of bouncing around a little bit of the bps is totally mix-driven, totally, which is totally out of our control. Secondly, no change whatsoever on the renewal of contracts and fees and all of that compared to all the practices that we have had. So basically zero change there. And then three, yes, given the factor investing -- huge push that we're making is allowing us to launch a lot of domestic products with indices and licenses to our EPF clients and that's a priority of ours. That's a good way for us to be domestically relevant in many of the big markets. So when you look at the MSCI iShares or the iShares MSCI minimum volatility ETF, it has been capturing significant amount of flows and that's great because it's all a domestic product with good fees and good revenues for iShares, for us and it's a win-win and it makes us much more relevant in the domestic market.
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And just another question on higher level of investment for the remainder of this year. Is that going to be focused more on some certain segments. I know Analytics margins have been a little bit higher than the 25% that you've been talking about as like a normalized level. Like is that 25% still the right normalized number to think about, or is it a little bit higher than that in Analytics?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, on Analytics, the last two quarters have been great positive surprises, clearly for us and for you and a lot of it is because we keep hammering and hammering away of the allocation of cost and investments and all of that, and that has yielded positive results. But the product line needs investment. This new architecture is hugely important in order to not only create the platform for higher growth of the product line, but also making us even more efficient, because we have so many platforms that we had to maintain, right. And now with this new initiative since the fourth quarter on fixed income analytics, again, we're incubating that initiative by [indiscernible] to pay full. So if they put at some point as we see the development of revenues, then that initiative will have to fund it additionally. So that's why I think that we got to be realistic and I think 25% is not a bad number to use.
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And then just lastly, regarding M&A, can you just give us some color on the pipeline and are there any areas that you're more focused on right now?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. I think that -- in M&A, obviously, the last 10 years, we've made the big acquisitions we wanted to make to position the Company well. We're not really looking for any bigger type of acquisitions unless they're blatant and they're right in our mainstream and they create significant amount of shareholder returns. If not, we'll pass, right? So we are focused on trying to look for bolt-on at this point, and those are opportunistic and they come sometimes, they don't. But in all of this thing, we're here to create value and therefore the discipline of the returns -- high returns is still valid, automatic and obsessive].
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi: Can you talk about the improvements in your go-to-market in light of new subscription sales number that you've talked about? What particular business lines do you feel like you're having the most success there?
Henry Fernandez: Laurent Seyer, our Global Head of Client Coverage is sitting here next to me and smiling. He joined us 16 months ago, 15 months ago, and he's done an incredible job in revamping the go-to-market strategy in a variety of ways. We've changed dramatically the compensation system. We launched that at the beginning of this year to a much more incentivized system. So far so good, early days, but so far very good. We can attribute some of the success on the fourth quarter and first quarter through that incentive plan. Three, we have streamlined a lot of the efforts there. We drove out lower performers, focused on the higher ones, made sure we're focused on the right territories and so on and so forth. We've put out lot of effort into the senior account managers in order go to sea level of our clients, and in addition to the bottom up selling, the top down selling and those are beginning to produce some great results. So I think that across the board, not just in one product line -- by the way, we merged all the -- we brought out there, Laurent's leadership, all of the products lines from real estate to ESG to that. We regionalized them under the leadership of the various regional managers. We have a complete team among the regional managers. He and his finance team have done an incredible job building out all the metrics. So we are looking at managing the whole coverage effort by metrics that we place. So all of that is yielding great results and is all across the board and more to come.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. And maybe we could delve a little bit more to Analytics. How sensitive is that business to market volatility? I think you mentioned maybe some delays in 1Q because of what we saw there? And where do you stand from a progression standpoint in improving the overall portfolio? Like what inning do you think you're in from an average perspective?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, look, I think there are two conflicting trends in market volatility with Analytics. On one hand, when volatility increases a lot, the product is more badly needed. People want to focus on risk and where the performance is coming from and all of that. So radical demand goes up. On the other hand, sometimes top suppliers get a little bit itchy and they slowdown the decision making process, and therefore the pipeline slows. We don't tend to see the things coming out of the pipeline. Honestly, what we just tend to see is that we were hoping post some sign this quarter and it just slipped to the first few weeks of the next quarter and therefore that makes the sales a little more -- little more volatile sometimes. So that's -- now where we are, I think that I'm going to say something that sometimes people -- I think Analytics over time, over a 10-year period, could potentially surpass the size of the Index business. And the reason is that there are a lot more use cases that you can this to around the world. There are so many asset managers and asset owners that need a platform to be able to understand performance and risk and portfolio construction and asset allocation, and I think we're only in the early innings of providing that but it's a new industry, it's a new process, it's a new -- this, we're largely it, we're at the forefront of all of that and obviously, we're doing it with legacy systems and legacy products and we're trying to break out of that problem in order to grow faster and be more profitable. But I think this is a tremendous opportunity for somebody and I hope that it turns out to be for MSCI.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. And last one for me real quickly, can you talk about other opportunities for potential cost containment? Obviously, you're going through the portfolio and you talked about being a third through the journey of understanding the costs. But are there any particular areas that you're focused on, examining the cost structures right now, and think that there may be more opportunities?
Henry Fernandez: I think it's blocking and tackling. We're focused intensely on performance of people, so that if somebody given them a chance, they're performing, we upgrade and therefore create more productivity at a fixed cost. Secondly, this whole metric that I'm talking about is huge, is huge. We always had good instincts and good gut feelings and the like and we've made great decision. We're trying to improve that decision making process dramatically by preaching the same thing that we tell our clients, manage their portfolios with quantitative tools, right. So manage our decisions by metrics and that has a lot of improvement. Improvement in theory out of the cost and when the payback of those costs in the investment, what the returns of those investments are, put the money where it's a higher multiple evaluation rather than a lower multiple evaluation and not every dollar EBITDA -- the value are the same, and so on and so forth. So, as I said, we're in the early innings of that and I think that will yield lot of results over time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Warren Gardiner with Evercore.
Warren Gardiner: So you guys gave us a lot of good sort of updates on the level of price increases you guys have been able to pass along on across the Index side and the Analytics side I think over the past year. But could you give us a sense of maybe where or how much of the current subscription run rate is yet to be repriced for both of those areas?
Henry Fernandez: One think that is very important to keep in mind is we are in the middle of a lot of work in understanding the pricing and the level of price increases and renegotiations of contracts versus the volume versus volume, how much of the run rate is subject to this, how much of it is not and all of that and we're giving you directional comments because we're not yet in a position to give you very specific metrics. And this is part of the metrics where hopefully in the next couple of quarters we'll be able to give you very specific things with a high degree of confidence. We know a lot but we want to double check and triple check fully those numbers. At this point a lot of the multi-asset class risk management analytics run rate is not yet priced at a level that is commensurate to the value that it provides.
Warren Gardiner: Okay. Fair enough. And I guess, with some of the M&A or I guess, proposed M&A out there, are you guys seeing any signs of increased opportunity for index switches is on the ETF side at all?
Henry Fernandez: We are and we're seeing a major differentiation between those index providers that are revenues centers to the client like we are versus those that are cost centers. So we're seeing a bit more pressure by ETF sponsors to rotate out of those that are lower cost if they don't add a great deal of value. The benefit of MSCI is that given our $10 trillion plus of client assets that are benchmarked to MSCI, a lot of ETF launches are option contracts, so to speak, on a call on that money to be invested in those ETFs. So we become a revenue center for our clients. So we are constantly in dialogue with our clients to see what do they have in their portfolio that it is managed against an index that is not giving them what they want, but we want to be in the areas where we add a lot of value and we have a premium pricing and we do not want to be in those areas that we're competing on cost.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
Keith Housum: Question for you around the cash flow. Obviously, that number is lower than it was first quarter 2015 and I think you cited the incentive compensation accruals and timing of payments. Can you provide just a little bit more color on I guess, the decline in the year-over-year decline of free cash flow for the first quarter?
Henry Fernandez: Mainly, just as we indicated due to timing. So, essentially, when you look year-over-year, we've had a substantial growth in our business, including our invoicing. And a lot of that invoicing happened later in the quarter. Therefore, some of the collections that we had expected in the first quarter get actually moved to the second quarter. Plus, in terms of interest expense, with the two new debt offerings that we have, we now actually make an interest payment every quarter, right. So we have two debt offerings, they pay semi-annually, but the way it works out is every quarter we'll have one interest payment, roughly in the $20 million to $25 million range.
Keith Housum: Got you, okay. Appreciate that. And a follow-up question, if I could. You guys talked about being a one-third way through in terms of your cost containment initiatives. Can you perhaps just drill down a little bit further on in how you're doing that? Are you guys putting in a SAP system that's giving you better visibility or, how are you guys doing your performance metrics, I guess? Is there a tool that you're using to do that?
Stephen Davidson: Yes, so let me just say, and Rich will answer that as well, is that, look, when you look at the G&A line, you see meaningful increases year-over-year, which are not the way typically we want to run the Company. A lot of those increases have to go with the fact that we're putting a significant amount of resources on the financial technology that underpins the operations of the Company, including SAP and we clearly are putting a lot of money in the tax projects. So, Rich?
Rich Napolitano: Overall, internally, we call it our business intelligence initiative, which as Henry mentions is the ultimate goal to provide very transparent timely decisions support information to all the business heads. And it's not just about SAP, right, that's one tool and a portfolio tool that we've been investing in. And we're investing in SAP to do a lot of the ERM and the general ledger functions. We're using other tools like Clarity to do project management, workforce management, as well as activity-based costing. We use Workday and Concur for either people management or expenses. And what we're doing is basically linking all these tools together into what we are calling this new business information platform. Again, we're along that journey. We still got some time to get there, but every quarter, we pump out better and better information as Henry has mentioned to help us manage.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous.
Vincent Hung: On Slide 7, on the client side, those greater than $1 million, how many clients does that relate to?
Andy Wichmann: It's probably in the -- more than three quarters of our clients, probably. So we look at our clients two ways. In a low parent child relationship where as we've disclosed we have about 6,500 clients, when of aggregate that at a parent level, we have about 3,800 clients and I would say about three quarters of those clients fall in that range.
Vincent Hung: Okay. And we talked a lot about Analytics and maybe I missed this. As far as your longer term outlook on Analytics, pretty interesting. Can you provide any insights into the competitive environment currently in that business?
Rich Napolitano: Yes, the competitive environment hasn't really changed that much. This definitely -- all our product lines will increasingly become more competitive and therefore, the name of the game is not to have competition. It is to compete and win and we're shaping up the Company to do that. So not a lot of change. There are only two or three providers on multi-asset class risk analytics, depending on the space, depending on what the client segment type, asset owners or asset managers of hedge funds, and there are two or three that provide equity portfolio management analytics. Obviously, we're trying to enter in a big way the fixed income portfolio management analytics space. There are other providers in there but we're trying to do it in a way that is congruent and attached to the work that we do on equity portfolio analytics and multi-asset class risk analytics for those clients.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time.
Henry Fernandez: Thank you very much for your time. We went over a bit, but we wanted to get to everyone on the line. So we will talk to everyone soon. Thank you.
Operator: Well, ladies and gentleman, that concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stephen C. Davidson - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you, Katherine. Good day and welcome to the MSCI fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the quarter. A copy of the release and a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find a reconciliation of the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 26 to 29 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Qutub, Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I am very pleased to share our strong fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial results with you. In my opening remarks, I will provide an update on how we are executing our strategy by focusing on the levers that will grow revenues, make us more operationally efficient, and continue to return capital to our shareholders. I will also provide strategic update on each of our product segment and then focus on innovation, which is at the core of MSCI. I will then conclude my remarks with an update on our operational efficiency gains in 2015, and a summary of our capital return to-date. If you turn to slide three for a review of our results, revenues increased 9% in the quarter and 8% for the whole year. These strong results were driven principally by Index products, which posted double-digit revenue increases in both subscription and ABF, both in the quarter and the whole year. Innovation continue to be our focus across all of our product lines, with particular strength in Index. In Analytics, we continue to innovate in our core use cases of investment differentiation, operational efficiency, risk management and regulatory compliance. These are the most prevalent use cases that we're solving for in terms of the need that our clients have. We're also innovating by developing services to address new use cases that our clients face. As ESG continues to move into the mainstream of investing, we are developing new products and services to meet that strong demand. In real estate, we're building out new products around global real estate market information and global real estate market risk and analytics and a new technology platform to deliver them to our clients more efficiently. Turning to efficiency, cost discipline is a high priority at MSCI. We are ensuring that our cost base is rationalized and that we have that the right resources lined up against our fastest-growing, highest-return opportunities. We also deliver on our commitment to begin lowering our operating tax rate, which was reduced for 2015 by roughly 100 basis points compared to 2014. And finally, capital, my favorite subject. MSCI continue to generate excellent cash flow, and we have strong growth prospects ahead that would only enhance our ability to create more value, whether it is from returning excess capital to shareholders, investing in organic growth opportunities or making small bolt-on acquisitions that complement the growth prospects that we have in our product line. Our track record on returning capital to our shareholders is very strong. Since December 2012, we have acquired approximately 25 million shares of MSCI and returned $1.5 billion to our investors. In summary, we're pleased with MSCI's performance in the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2015. And we believe that the foundation continues to be set for further growth in 2016 and beyond. Turning to slide four, we are providing you with a strategic update on our product line and the opportunity that we see for each of them in 2016. I'm not going to hit every item, but let me highlight the key takeaways for each segment. In our Index product segment, we continue to drive adoption of our global investing framework. And our success is reflected in strong growth in small cap and customer Index products. In 2015, product development continue to be exceptional with a total of 56 new indexes and product enhancement, representing an increase of 14% over 2014. ETFs based on our indexes, capture $88 billion of inflows in the year 2015, or 35% of the overall market, up from $49 billion a year earlier. Our development efforts have been focused on factor investing, where the estimated AUM linked to our factor indexes increased 17% to about $143 billion compared to $122 billion in 2014. In 2016, we believe there are several growth levers in our Index products. The new product pipeline remains strong, and we continue our relentless effort on innovation to change the investment world. Factors and ESG continue to be incorporated into the mainstream investment process. The globalization and international investing trend is expanding. And lastly, we expect continued growth for exchange-traded MSCI-linked futures and options as demand for multi-country, multi-currency exposure (8:31) growth. In Analytics, our team has done a great job in undertaking a major transformation of the product line across multiple dimensions, from strategy, product development to expense management to drive profitability. We're off to a strong start. We look forward to continue progress each quarter in this product line, and we will report accordingly. MSCI won Market Risk Technology Product of the Year at the 2016 Risk Magazine Awards. Our liquidity metrics product, the first commercially available tool for measuring liquidity risk across asset classes, was cited as an important innovation by Risk Magazine. The Analytics team will build on the successes of 2015 by creating new products and services that serve the operational and risk management use cases that we are seeing the most traction in with our clients around the world. The major data center migration we completed in the fall will bolster the capabilities we bring to our largest clients in processing their portfolios. Profitability will continue to be a focus as we reallocate resources to initiatives that drive future growth and profitability. In 2016, we believe there are several growth levers in Analytics, continued growth from our core use cases, developing new partnerships on products and services. We started a systematic program of price increases that reflect the increased value we're providing clients. And again, profitability will be a continued focus as we set the foundation for a stronger revenue growth after 2016. Lastly, in our All Other segment, in ESG, we saw increasing interest from clients in the integration of ESG factors into the mainstream investment strategies. As the leading provider of ESG data, ratings, research and tools worldwide, MSCI is well positioned to continue to benefit from this trend in 2016. In terms of growth levers for the year, product enhancements will be a driver of op sales, and we will continue to leverage our deep relationship with asset owners around the world to drive further adoption of ESG. In real estate, we're strongly focused on realizing rapid improvements in this product line and are making changes in almost every area of the business. We completed the integration of the real estate sales team into MSCI's overall sales organization. We are accelerating development of the strategically important products, and we are moving operations head count to lower-cost centers. We expect this product line to go from a loss in 2015 to breakeven in 2016 and set the foundation to return to profitability beyond the year. I'd like to spend a moment now discussing how MSCI leverages our content across our ecosystem. This is an important but at times misunderstood element of value creation in our business model. On slide five, I can tell you that at the core of our company, MSCI is a content company that leverages and shares content across the entire MSCI ecosystem to innovate new products and services. The generation of that content starts with understanding the investment problems of our client, designing a solution to them in the form of a model of some kind. We call them methodologies and Index and models in Analytics. And then that model can be then turned into either data or analytical calculators such as performance attribution calculators, repayment models, pricing libraries and so on and so forth. And in terms of the data, it could be equity in big data, equity risk model data, fix income risk model data, multi-asset class model data, and so on and so forth. We deliver our content to our clients, as I said, in the form of indexes, risk models, valuation models, ESG Research, real estate data or benchmarks. All of our content, our software applications and our services are designed to help our clients improve their overall investment processes and make better investment decisions. Our content sits at the very center of our client's investment processes. It provides them with the insights and tools they need to build and manage their portfolios. A key part of my own job is to build senior-level relationship with our largest clients around the world. In my conversations with them, they tell me that the quality of our content is what sets MSCI apart. It is why they choose MSCI to help them with their biggest and most complex investment problems. It is easy to look at our business in the way we present ourself in financial reporting, sort of broken out between Index and Analytics and ESG and real estate, et cetera. But content is a unifying element, and it will be our ability to integrate that content across all of our product lines that will unlock incremental levels of growth and profitability for MSCI in years to come. On slide six is a concrete example of how we leverage this virtuous circle of content I just discussed within the MSCI ecosystem. The investments that we have made in the past several years, combined with the content that we have brought to Index from our other product areas, such as equity analytics and ESG and real estate and the like have positioned us to significantly grow not only in terms of AUM linked to global equity products, but also significantly in MSCI Factors, ESG and Thematic Indexes. This growth has been at a rate that is about five times the growth of our core market cap franchise, which itself is growing at a very healthy base of around 15% CAGR. So this case study in innovation serves to diversify our franchise and represent another layer of growth for MSCI in the years to come. Before moving to the next slide, let me take a moment to comment briefly on the market volatility that we're seeing as it relates to ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. Like all of you, we are continuing to monitor the market, but we're very pleased with the performance of ETF linked to MSCI indexes. Of the $34 billion plus in decline in AUM in MSCI-linked ETF since the beginning of the year, about 97%, 98% of that or about $33 billion plus of that decline is due to market depreciation and not outlooks. As you all know, in your own businesses, outflows or inflows are the true measure of the health of an investment product, and therefore, we are pretty satisfied to see that we're holding up very well there, despite the decline in valuations. As we highlight on slide seven, the innovation that I just discussed had led to a strong leadership position and Index provider to the ETF marketplace worldwide. The share of total equity ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes increased to about 19% at the end of 2015 compared to 17% at the end of 2014, driven by strong inflows. During the year, equity ETF linked to our indexes captured $88 billion in net cash inflows, up from $49 billion in the prior year. So the share of investment flows in ETF linked to our indexes increased from about 20% in 2014 to about 35% in 2015, making us the number one equity Index provider in 2015 by this measure. We were also the Index leader for full-year 2015 in terms of net cash inflows to ETF based on currency-hedged indexes. Net cash flows in ETF linked to factor indexes, which increased almost three times compared to 2014 levels, and also our leadership position as number one in ETF – the launch of new ETF linked to equity indexes. So, we're very pleased with the positioning of our Index franchise for ETF managers, and we're not resting on our laurels. We will continue to innovate and work to create the next wave of products that will drive our future growth. On slide eight, we highlight our cost discipline. We saved $21 million of cost in 2015, which allow us to focus our resources on higher-growth, higher-return opportunities while keeping overall cost growth, including the impact of foreign exchange, within our 5% to 7% growth range. The key takeaway is our hitting the right balance between cost management and investing for the future. Lastly, on slide nine, we highlight the strong capital return track record that we have established. As I said earlier, we returned $1.5 billion in capital to investors since late 2012, and we intend to keep returning capital to our shareholders over the longer term. In summary, we registered strong growth in the quarter. We're continuing to focus on the levers that we believe will drive revenue growth, improvements in operational efficiency, and the continued optimization of our capital base with a strong capital return program. With a relentless focus on these areas in the quarters and years to come, we believe we can enhance the growth and profitability of MSCI over the long term. All of us at MSCI believe that we're still on the ground floor of what is possible to achieve with this company. Before I end, I want to offer my personal appreciation to Bob Qutub for his years of service to the company during a time of tremendous growth and change. As we announced a couple of weeks ago, Bob has decided to retire from MSCI to spend a bit more time with his young family and consider a new opportunity in the future. I am pleased Bob will be with us until we on-board his successor to ensure a smooth transition. Bob?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Henry, for the kind words. It's been a tremendous pleasure to work with MSCI teams, the board and our investors, but let's get into the results here. So, let's turn to slide 11 where I'll begin my overview of our financial results. Our results this quarter were strong with a 9% increase in revenue and a 1% decline in adjusted EBITDA expenses, driving a 22% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 500 basis point increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin, 46.5%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Just a quick couple comments on the results. We closed the acquisition of Insignis in the fourth quarter and the contribution to revenues and expenses was negligible. So we're not adjusting our numbers to derive an underlying organic growth. Our results also include higher interest cost from our bond offerings in November 2014 and August of 2015. As we stated last quarter, we're in the process of aligning our tax profile with our global operating footprint. And I am pleased to report that we're already seeing benefits, which are reflected in the decline of our operating tax rate for the full-year 2015. On that note, tax benefits in the quarter contributed $0.04 to adjusted EPS, which includes the impact of discrete items from prior periods, as well as a positive impact on our 2015 operating rate, which was 34.8%. The 9% decline in the weighted average shares outstanding year-over-year added about $0.06 to our adjusted EPS. Again, as a reminder in the slides that follow, we provide the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our subscription revenue and costs, but we do not provide the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our asset-based fees tied to average AUM, of which approximately two-thirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Turning to slide 12, we provide you with a bridge for the year-over-year change in our revenues by segment and revenue type. Total revenues increased $22 million or 9% to $273 million year-over-year, driven by an increase of $15 million or 7% in recurring subscription revenues, an increase of $5 million or 10% in asset-based fees and a $2 million increase in non-recurring revenue. Currency fluctuations had about a $2 million negative impact on our overall subscription revenues, which includes recurring subscription in non-recurring revenue. And this negative impact was mostly split between the Analytics and All Other product areas. Excluding the impact of FX, subscription revenue would have increased 9%. The $5 million or 10% increase in asset-based fee revenue to $50 million was driven primarily by $50 billion increase in average AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI indexes to $423 billion, as well as a growth in non-ETF institutional passive funds linked to MSCI indexes and the growth in trading volumes in exchange-traded futures and options contracts linked to MSCI indexes. Turning to slide 13, we provide you with year-over-year adjusted EBITDA expense bridge. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA expenses decreased $1 million or 1% to $146 million, but increased $6.1 million or 4% compared to third quarter 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, our adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased $4 million or 3% year-over-year and 5% for the full-year 2015 compared to full year 2014. The increase in cost on a linked-quarter basis was driven by higher general and administrative compensation and benefits, increased development costs, as well as higher selling and marketing costs. Shown in the lower half of the chart, we registered decreases of 7% and 2% in cost of revenues in selling and marketing respectively, partially offset by increases in general and administrative and research costs. Lower cost of revenues was primarily driven by lower head count, generally across the board, reflecting a more efficient management of our product set. Lower marketing costs contributed to the decline in selling and marketing. On slide 14, we provide the run rate bridge for the quarter. Our reported run rate increased 8% to $1.1 billion, consisting of a 7% increase in subscription run rate to $888 million, and a 15% increase in ABF run rate to $201 million. Adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations, subscription run rate grew 8% year-over-year. We were pleased by the growth – by the record growth in new recurring sales for the full-year 2015 and the fourth quarter. While sales in the quarter were stronger, the net new recurring declined slightly, due to higher levels of cancellations. Price increases represented a larger percentage of recurring sales, up from prior periods, driven primarily by price increases and Analytics. Cancellations in the quarter were higher primarily due to an increase in closures and strategy changes. Based on the dialogue that we're having with our clients, the uptick in cancellations above the seasonal norms does not appear to be carrying over into the first quarter and our pipeline of deals remain strong. While we are pleased with the strong sales in the quarter, it is too early to determine if this quarter represents the beginning of a new trend in sales. For MSCI overall, aggregate retention dipped, as is customary in the fourth quarter, to 90%, but the full-year retention of 93% was in line with full-year 2014. On slides 15 through 18, I will walk you through our segment results. Let's begin with Index on slide 15. Revenues for Index increased 11% on a reported basis with negligible impact from FX. The double-digit increases in subscription and ABF revenue in the quarter were driven by strong sales from our market cap products and continued fast growth in our innovative factor, ESG, and thematic products throughout 2015 and strong inflows into ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Index was 69%. The decline in the adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the third quarter 2015 was due to three factors. One, higher incentive compensation; two, higher severance cost; and three, higher corporate allocations of professional fees primarily related to corporate tax planning. Excluding discrete items in these areas, Index margin would have been approximately 70%. So, with 70% as an exit rate and factoring in the lower expected asset-based fees due to the decline in equity values, as well as the seasonal first quarter increases in compensation and benefits, we would expect to begin 2016 with margins around fourth quarter levels. We ended the full year with adjusted EBITDA margin at 70%, which is in line with our target. Index ended 2015 with a very strong retention rate of 95% and in line with the full-year 2014. On slide 16, we provide you with detail around our asset-based fee. First, in terms of revenue from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, a 13% in average ETF AUM drove a 9% increase in ETF revenue with the increase AUM offset by a decline in average basis points as shown in the lower-right chart. Inflows in the quarter were very strong at $29 billion, and while the start of 2016 has been rocky, we are pleased with our overall performance. The decline in average basis points year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was due to two factors. First, the movement away from higher fee emerging market products to lower fee developed market products, including the U.S., as illustrated in the lower-left chart, as well as mix shift within developed markets to lower fee products. And second, there was some erosion due to total expense ratio changes by several clients which impacted our average fee. These same drivers offset the 1% increase in AUM linked to MSCI indexes on a linked-quarter basis. In terms of weighting these two drivers, the vast majority of the change was due to mix. Institutional passive revenues are up year-over-year but declined on a linked-quarter basis. Lastly, in terms of futures and options linked to MSCI indexes, increasing levels of adoption and an increase in market volatility in the second half of 2015 has driven increases in trading volumes with average daily volume of 200,000 contracts in the second half of 2015. That's up 29% compared to the second half of 2014. And the year ended with 1.5 million contracts at open interest, up 20% versus year-end 2014. Turning to slide 17, we highlight the financials for the Analytics segment. With the consolidation of product groups within Analytics segment and the focus on solving client use cases, the legacy product lines of portfolio management analytics and risk management analytics no longer reflect how the segment is being managed. As a result, we are no longer breaking out the results for that segment in these two legacy product lines. Revenues for Analytics increased 5% on a reported basis and on an FX-adjusted basis and the adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28% and compared to 19% for the quarter of prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher risk manager, equity models and InvestorForce revenues. Higher-than-anticipated margin relative to the guidance provided in the third quarter was driven primarily by higher-than-anticipated non-recurring revenue and the reversal of prior period accruals for long-term incentive compensation related to the departure of a senior executive. Adjusting for these items, the normalized Analytics margin would have been 25%, which is in line with the guidance we provided, and we believe is a good exit rate for 2015. Then you can factor in customary first quarter seasonal impact of higher comp and benefits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22% for the full-year 2015. And at the end of 2015, Analytics retention was 93%, up from 92% in 2014. And lastly, for our Other segment on slide 18, we have the All Other. Revenues for All Other increased 14% to $19 million on a reported basis and grew 17% on an FX-adjusted basis. And the adjusted EBITDA margin continued to improve. First, in terms of ESG, a $1 million or 15% increase in ESG revenue to $10 million was driven by record sales for ESG research. In terms of ESG sales, it was a very strong quarter, especially for the Americas. Run rate growth in the U.S. of 17% year-over-year surpassed EMEA growth of 15%. This is the first time since 2011 that this has happened and reflects the mainstreaming of ESG into the investment process. Growth in ESG continues to be fueled by the addition of new clients. Now turning to real estate, a $1 million or 14% increase in real estate revenue to $9 million was driven by a strong increase in custom data reports for clients. Excluding the impact of FX, real estate revenue would have increased 20% compared to fourth quarter last year and would have been up slightly for the full-year 2015 compared to full-year 2014. And beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we will consolidate ESG and real estate in our reporting, but we will continue to provide you with color on the performance of each product within the segment. On slide 19, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $778 million, which includes cash held outside of the U.S. of $128 million. And as a general policy, we maintain a domestic cash cushion of approximately $150 million for operational purposes. Free cash flow was up slightly for the year with higher cash from stronger operating results, partially offset by higher interest and cash taxes. As a reminder, interest payments on our outstanding debt are paid quarterly in February, May, August, and November. Just a quick refresh on leverage. Our goal is maintain gross leverage between 3.0 and 3.5 with the only constraint for net leverage not equaling gross leverage being the cash we hold offshore and for domestic operating purposes of totaling approximately $275 million at this time. In full-year 2015, we paid out 35% of our adjusted EPS as a dividend and it's at the midpoint of our payout range. On slide 20, we have our new guidance for the full-year 2016. We expect adjusted EBITDA expense to come in between $610 million and $625 million, and this implies a year-over-year increase in cost of approximately 4% using the midpoint of the 2016 range. FX spot rates at the end of 2015 are the basis for rates in this expense guidance. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $92 million. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million. And free cash flow is expected to come in between $270 million and $310 million. And lastly, the effective tax rate is expected to come in between 33% and 34%. And in terms of our financial policies, we are reaffirming our dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40% of adjusted EPS. And lastly, as a follow-up to the issuance of our long-term targets last October, we are reaffirming those targets as of this call. And with that, I would now like to open up the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Can you – I guess both of you made some quick comments on the sales environment. So, maybe you can go back that a little bit and provide a little bit more detail, and clearly, your core customer base is probably suffering a little bit so far this year over the last few months. So, what are your hearing from clients in terms of willingness to buy new products. And also pricing I believe is going to be a big component on the Analytics side this year. So, what's the push back you're hearing on that in particular? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, Alex, first of all, the market volatility that we've seen has not had any impact on our pipeline. Our pipeline continues to be healthy and solid and no impact on that. Secondly is that we have started rolling out price increases on Analytics and it's gone fairly well. So, we do not anticipate for now any kind of pushback by our clients. We did have very strong sales quarter both in one-time sales and also in recurring sales in the fourth quarter, which are focus there of that range of sales that we have had for quite a few quarters. And it's too early to tell whether that break is sustainable. We did well, but it's too early to tell and therefore, we feel good about the quarter. But we got to execute this quarter and the future quarters to see if we can break out of that range-bound that we have had for some time. In an environment of significant volatility, it's actually sometimes a positive environment for us, even though our clients are not feeling well because there's a lot of focus on risk, there is a lot of focus on understanding the performance of portfolios, there is a meaningful amount of money that flows into passive investments from active that we benefit and the like. And obviously, on the other side, budget gets a little more tight, approvals get longer and the like, but on balance, it has not affected us. And the last thing that I will say, Alex, is that we are typically a very a light indicator of any of this. It typically takes several quarters before any meaningful market volatility affects us on the subscription business. We obviously have seen the decline in values in ABF, but fortunately, not any meaningful amount of outflows.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Then I guess maybe secondly, just for Bob real quick on the tax rates, obviously, a nice guide down on the year-over-year perspective. Is that a good – at the midpoint, is that a good point to use for the full quarter – I'm sorry, for the full year every quarter? Or do you think it's actually going to trickle down throughout the year as you get, I guess, smarter with the tax rate? And then, related to that, what are your current thinking as we exit 2016 and look forward to 2017, 2018, 2019, as you probably do a little bit more aggressive tax planning?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: We have been focused on the operating rate, Alex. And we did see some benefits, as I talked in my comment. We did also get some benefits from discrete items that we went back and actually got some deductions from prior periods and that got all reflected here, so it magnified the effect on the effective tax rate. But we are guiding down, it's safe to say generally, when we give you a range, we like to look at the midpoint. And that's what we expect our rate to be next year plus or minus discrete items if they come through. We have more certainty in our planning this year than we did last year. For example, the R&D credit is now permanent, so that helps us a lot. So, I feel that's a pretty sustainable rate throughout the year. There are things that can change it, Alex, the mix of international profits and things like that. But right now based on what we're seeing, we will look at 33% to 34% and if things change, we'll let you know appropriately, but we feel comfortable at this point right now.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: And no comments on ongoing work to reduce it even further beyond 2016?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: We'll always – we're going to continue to focus. We see more upside out there, but as some of the work that we need to is more extensive and requires a lot more work with our advisors, but we continue to press on. It's not something we're going to take our eye off the ball. And if we have positive surprises – positive developments not surprises, we'll update you accordingly.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I wanted to ask about the Index business, specifically. It looked like the sales had been strong on a year-over-year basis, but also the cancellations were up. You had mentioned this in your comments. I just wanted to see if we could get a little bit more color there. Fortunately, it was offset by some improvement in Analytics, but I thought we should start out with Index.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Bill, there is – with respect to cancels, right, there is absolutely nothing to read into these numbers in the fourth quarter. There are times in which you pick up a little, cancel here and there and it exacerbates the numbers. So, we are not concerned about it. We don't think this is a trend. We think these are just sort of quarter-to-quarter variations and the like. And we continue to be positive about the continued growth of the subscription business on, what we call, the market data, the market capitalization indexes and are very focused on the incremental growth of the franchise into new areas such as the factor indexes, the ESG indexes, the thematic indexes, the custom indexes. We're also very focused on the expansion of the futures and options franchise linked to MSCI indexes that we did well. We think we're going to continue to do well given the market volatility that is happening and the like. So, the franchise is – continues to be very strong, and I would not read too much into those numbers.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Well, you really touched on my second question, which was going to be about the futures and options opportunity for you. I know that, with some other indexes, some of your competitors, they have a higher percentage of revenue coming in from these types of products. And the challenge, it seemed to be, at least initially, that it was a more complex product, meaning that you were going across multiple currencies. And so maybe you could talk a little bit about how you solved that problem and what you think the opportunity is. How big is it now in terms of what you are doing, and how fast is it growing?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So the – most listed futures and options in equity indexes around the world are national, so meaning single-country, single-currency or multi-country, but single-currency like in continental Europe with the EURO STOXX 50. So, I think – so that has been the nature of the listed futures and options industry. And you require typically a very healthy amount of listed futures and options to develop a large structure of product, structure-derivative product business because related products are the ones that are used to hedge the positions in the structured products. So, that's a business that many – some of our competitors who are more – who have developed more into national Index businesses have benefited from. We have been hard at work on developing with our partners, the industry of multi-country, multi-currency futures. We started with the New York Stock Exchange life exchange that was acquired by ICE, so we're working pretty close with ICE now in the U.S. to develop that. The volumes on the MSCI emerging market Index futures and the MCSCI EAFE futures trading in New York have been increasing rapidly and steadily. So, we like that. We're trying to see if we can do the same in Europe and Asia as well. So, this is an area of good growth in double digits, but it is from a very small base at the moment. And it's not going to be a huge growth driver immediately, but it's a steady – it will be a steady build. And as I said in the past, there are always three big legs that you can build on equity index franchise around, there is the active leg, which is what we call subscription. There's the passive leg, which is institutional passive and ETF, and then there is the hedging or exposure leg, which is futures and options and other forms of structured products. So, we've been very good in the first two, and we're now really attacking with a hard drive, the third leg, to see if we can capitalize on the breakthroughs that have been made in the creation of multi-currency futures.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Analytics margins, the margins in Analytics were extremely strong in this quarter and, I think, above what you had previously been guiding to. It sounds like FX was a contributor. But is there anything else to call out? And, really, if I look at that segment, the first half and second half were so different in terms of the margin profile. So how should we think about 2016 for Analytics margins?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I'll try to – that's a good question, Toni. We tried to address that, and we were fully cognizant of the margin came in a little different than we had guided in the third quarter. Two things, on a top line, sales again were very strong in the fourth quarter as you saw both recurring and non-recurring totaling $40 million in aggregate. So, we did have one-time sales came in, in Q4 that helped the Analytics that we weren't anticipating, which is – that's a good thing. Secondly, I did refer to the reversal of an incentive compensation have closed significant for senior executive that left in the fourth quarter after our call. And then we did file an 8-K on that in Q4. Those were two of the principal drivers, there were a few one-times in there. But we knew about most of them. But I would say, those two items really steered the margin the other way. Having said that, I tried to give you the normalization of around 25% as we enter into 2016, for Q1, adjusted for some tax inflationary costs related to compensation. Hopefully that helps a little bit, Toni.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. It does. Thank you. And you have been doing a number of repurchases, especially in the second half of last year. How should we think about pacing of buybacks in 2016? And if you could just remind us, how should we think about repurchases as a percentage of free cash flow, just on a normal sort of policy basis? Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think the way to think about it, Toni, one is, we are not in the mood or desire to restore excess capital in the company or in the balance sheet, right? So, to begin with. Secondly, we want to be opportunistic with our repurchases, which – at higher share prices we do less but we still do – we'll do some and at lower share prices, we do more, the volume. And therefore, every quarter is going to be different, depending on where our share price is trading, and what the volumes are because, obviously, we want to do this in a way that we're not impacting the natural demand-supply and price discovery in the stock. So that's kind of the balancing act that we have, but we've done well so far, right? We've done really well in the last six, nine months or so with this strategy. And we definitely intend to continue to do that if we can.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Chris.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: On the EBITDA expense guidance for 2016, what exchange rates have you used for the pound and euro and what would cause you guys to be at the low end versus the high end?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: We used the – same as last year, we use the spot rates of December 31 to convert all of our currencies. So, we're really starting out fresh. That was the basis for $610 million to $625 million. So, that's something you can get pretty easily. I don't have it here in front of me, but we've got those for you. And regarding the – I think as Henry talked about, we remain vigorously addressing our cost base, making sure we're as efficient as we can to provide ourselves opportunities that are out there. And as with all the years, Chris, we're going to one times, but we still want to stay whole and true to our 5% to 7% and 4% is guiding to our midpoint. That gives us room if need be, but we're going keep our eye on the markets along with a question that Alex dropped in the first part of his call here. So, again, right now, $610 million to $625 million as we move through the year, similar to last year, we'll definitely steer you on a tighter path.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The other thing is, if you sit back and look at the totality of the company, right, in terms of cash flows and balance sheet and all of that, if you put aside for a minute the ABF, which I'll comment on in a second, but if you put aside the ABF, our revenues are largely in the hard currencies. Obviously, most of them are in dollars, in euros, in pounds, and in yens, right? And our cost is also in those hard currencies, but is also a meaningful amount of the cost is in the soft currencies of various emerging markets. So, on a net-net basis, a stronger dollar ends up being mildly positive for us. And particularly the way it has evolved, which has become strong relative to the hard currencies, but not as strong as comparing to the appreciation relative to the weaker currencies, the soft currencies. So...
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. And maybe just on that point, just to give you something concrete, in terms of subscription revenues, our billable in dollars for our revenues is 83% in dollars, so that leaves 17% for non-dollars. And those exposures are euro, yen and sterling on an absolute basis. On expenses, our billable currency other than the U.S. dollar has increased slightly to 44%. We've talked about that being 40% in the past. And our larger exposures are sterling, but then again that gets offset by the revenue. So, really our net exposure on EBITDA and revenues for subscription revenues would be – mainly euro would be our biggest one out there. Having said that, we don't factor in the AUM, although two-thirds of those are denominated in other currencies than the U.S. dollar.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And that's kind of clearly the issue that's always hard, right, because a lot of the AUM is in non-dollar in the passive products. And so when the dollar strengthen against that, you see an immediate weakening of those AUM levels, but typically more assets flow into those because of the exchange rate and, over time, they kind of come back up to prior levels. So, that's always harder to do that. But net-net, we're not worried at all about the strength of the dollar because it's a mild positive and we're not worried of a reversal of the strength of the dollar because it's not a big impact on us. We're largely hedged, not totally, but we're largely hedged.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Then can I just ask a question on Analytics. Maybe – you've talked a lot about this in the past, but can you just flesh out some of the – you talked about opportunities for 2016 in Analytics, whether it be core use cases, new partnerships, pricing, et cetera. Can you just flesh some of that out a little bit more? And I also was hoping to get an update on the technology platform that you guys have talked about in the past. Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, on Analytics, we are trying to gradually transform the product line from selling risk models and software applications and things like that to understanding very specific client needs, and then offering them a solution to that client need by packaging our content and our applications. Not on a bespoke or customized basis, but just with certain adjustments, but addressing specifically a client need. The four client needs that we're very focused on is a lot of our clients, particularly active managers, are very intent of creating differentiation in their performance and showing that differentiation to their own clients. So, that's one. Another one is, a lot of our clients are under cost pressures and profit pressures and, therefore, they're trying to reduce costs. So, a lot of what we do it creates transparency, efficiencies and therefore reduction of costs. So, many of our clients are tackling the issue of how do they deal with risk and how do they report risk and how do they manage risk. So, that's another one. And lastly, huge amount of regulatory burden on all forms of clients from asset managers to hedge funds to banks and the like. So, we go to them and say, let's fully understand what the regulators are asking for from you and how do we help you create the content and the reports that help you with that. So, very much – and that has resonated very well with our clients. And we're trying to push that mode of service at them. So – and we continue to clearly innovate in terms of new risk models, new performance contribution models and so on and so forth. So we can spend more time on that offline. Now, all this content that we create has to be enabled by applications. Pretty much everything we do at MSCI has to be enabled by applications, but especially a lot of the Analytics content, a lot of the models have to be enabled by, what I call, workflow applications. So, you got to think BarraOne, and RiskManager, and BPM as kind of workflow applications. But then they're not the only ones. There are also – we also give the content to our clients and they use their own applications, particularly the large passive managers. Many of the – some of the hedge funds and the like, so we work with them on that. And lastly, we would – and this is where the partnerships come in, is that we're trying to work with other providers of workflow applications of different types to put our content in them to serve the needs of the client. And therefore, is either in areas that we do and we also compete with, or in areas that we don't do, so how do we put our applications side-by-side with OMS applications, for example, or for an office applications that could be helpful to the client. So we're working on that in order to, again, facilitate the serving of the needs of the clients. And lastly on – we are – the difficulty we've had in this product line and a part of the lower profitability on this product line is because given the nature of the way we grew, which was by acquisitions, we still have quite a lot of legacy applications that are all similar to one another, built in different languages and different use, different interfaces and all of that. So that – maintaining – first of all innovating on them and maintaining them is costly and that it's a way – a meaningful amount on the profit margin on our content. So, what we're doing is building an overlay application, which we call, new interface, new architecture, an overlay application that we put on top of this with a user interface, so that's what the client eventually sees. And therefore, we then go to the engine room and link the current applications and make the current applications more of engine to that. So, we're going to be launching the first release of that next quarter, which is still – obviously it doesn't have everything, but it's just step-by-step. And we're going to start signing up clients on that. But we're still going to sell the existing applications because that's what we have today.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could tell us or maybe give us some detail around how the increase in custom indexes is impacting the business. Is there a different go-to-market for it and how you sort of see that playing out?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: This is an area of double-digit growth for us and has always been from a couple of decades and what it is, is that we have the off-the-shelf market capitalization indexes or factor indexes or the other ones and therefore, people come to us and say we want to be benchmarked with something that is worth targeting to what our investment objectives are. Can you help us with that? And the easy part, which is we repackage the countries in a different way or repackage industries in a different way or exclude a number of industries that they're concerned about or, in the case of ESG, exclude a different number of companies that are not compliant to what they believe to be a secret area. So, this is an area that we have created an industrial strength organization from the understanding of the client needs to looking at the methodology, to the production environment, which is pretty critical because you cannot have thousands of these indexes and all in a manual way. So, we are very well set to continue to grow here. And we see this as a way of the future in which clients will want to rifle-shoot their investment goals and have a benchmark that is tailoring to them.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. And maybe you could just talk about if you've seen any changes at all in the competitive environment either on custom indexes or in other areas. And any updates you could provide on sort of sales force additions would be great as well. Thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Not a lot competitive changes from last year at all. If anything, some of the types of acquisitions and mergers that have taken place have created openings for us to go out and insert ourselves, and that's been beneficial to our business. And now, the factor investing area is an area that we're leading, but is – we're very subject to clearly more competition at this moment. Quite a lot of the competition is not coming from traditional sources but more from asset managers that have fund teams that build these factor models. For example – and therefore, they don't make them available to everyone like we do, but they go to the client and offer the product sometimes in competition with our indexes. But we believe that given the huge expertise that we have on equity risk models, the Barra risk models, and the know-how that we have, Barra practically invented equity risk models and factor investing starting from the mid-1970s, so we have huge competitive advantage in having leadership in this area.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Doucette with KBW. Your line is open.
Douglas Doucette - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one question, wondering if you could give us any sense of the timeline on reaching the 15% to 20% margin target for the Other segment in light of your commentary about the real estate segment reaching breakeven this year.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, these are longer-term targets, right, but we clearly are intent on getting there sooner than later, right? We feel pretty good about the ESG product line. If anything, that's a product line that we can accelerate dramatically, higher profits, but it's a huge growth area, huge. It's at a $40 million-plus run rate and quite a lot of demand. So, we are balancing out the increasing of profit relative to investments that we want to make, so that we are – we continue to be the leader there. And, as we said, in real estate, we hope to breakeven next year, or maybe single-digit margins, and then we want to accelerate from there. But we can't tell you yet what the trajectory is, but we are fully intent on achieving those margins over a few years.
Douglas Doucette - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hugh Miller with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Hugh M. Miller - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: ...for squeezing me in as well. Just had one question on the Index retention. I know you guys had mentioned that some closures and strategy changes had weighed on 4Q and that it was kind of more of an anomaly. How comfortable are you guys with kind of the historical retention of 95%-ish as we think about 2016?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: For the full year, we're comfortable. We don't – there is no evidence of any meaningful change to that at this point. I know there would always be variations from quarter-to-quarter. So, there is no – we were not thinking about it any differently.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: And Q4 is always one – you got to put that in context. It tends to be seasonally, where a lot of clients will renew their contracts. We see it drop a little bit in Q4.
Hugh M. Miller - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Understood. Thank you. And then the other was just I appreciate the insight on the Analytics margins and stuff like that and you guys mentioning the potential to raise prices and not getting a lot of pushback from clients on that. Can you just help us – give us a sense of what type of level of price increases are you guys striving for, for 2016?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Well, we've pushed in 2015, in our repriceable portfolio on Index, we did 5% to 7%. And we look at that as the opportunity for 2016. Again, on Analytics, the emphasis there is it was really just starting in late 2015 and we were starting to push the price increases on that portfolio. We expect that to be a good piece of the growth that we're going to see in 2016 over 2015. And we'll update you more each quarter as we get into the year and we start realizing those price increases.
Hugh M. Miller - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I mean – but do you still also feel confident about your ability to maybe take share and grow the client base as well or is it more a function of just kind of adding value to the current client base and being able to charge more for that?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All of the above.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: All of the above. Yeah.
Hugh M. Miller - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Thanks, gentlemen. One question for you in terms of the Indexes and the asset-based fees. The pressure that ETFs are getting just from competitive stance in terms of lower – having to lower their fees, how tied is their reduction fees to what you guys recognize for under your fees for assets under management?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, the way a lot of our fees are structured is that our fee is a percentage of the management fee but (70:17) and it has a cap. So, if we're operating at the high end of that range and the manager lowers their fee, we come down with that lowering of the fee. But if we're at the lower end of the cap, which is where the largest of our funds are, then any lowering of the fee hits the floor.
Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Steve Davidson for any closing remarks.
Stephen C. Davidson - Head of Investor Relations: Thanks for your time this morning and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This will conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Stephen C. Davidson - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you, Shaniez. Good day and welcome to the MSCI third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for third quarter 2015. A copy of the release and a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. These documents include our new segment reporting and activity costs and disclosures. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures associate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evolution of results. You'll find a reconciliation of the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 32 to 40 of the earnings presentation. We have provided you with a lot of new disclosures this quarter. So to allow for more time for the Q&A, we'll try to limit the prepared remarks to incremental information not already included in our earnings release. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Qutub, Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you for joining us today. In my opening remarks, I plan to discuss some of the highlights from our strong third quarter, which builds upon the momentum that we have been developing over the last several quarters. Then I will like to share with you the bigger picture of MSCI. Our company's exciting strategies for the next several years is designed to lead to even greater revenue growth and profitability as well as increased cash flows. This strong financial performance should allow MSCI to continue its policy of returning significant capital to our shareholders. I am very excited to provide you with this look-ahead. But first our Q3 results, which start on slide three. As you saw from our press release, MSCI reported a strong third quarter. And one other thing, we delivered much higher levels of profitability, driven by solid revenue generation, and a strong cost discipline, resulting in double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and continued margin expansion. The highlights of Q3 include revenue growth of 7%, which combined with a 7% decline in adjusted EBITDA expenses drove a 740 basis point increase in margins to 48%, which is the highest margins reported by MSCI in almost three years. Total run rate growth was 6% and the recurring subscription run rate was up 8%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Net income was $64 million or $0.59 in diluted EPS. Adjusted net income was $66 million or $0.60 in adjusted EPS. Our business model continued to deliver a strong cash flow. Furthermore, our well-timed $800 million issuance of senior notes in early August, just before the spike in market volatility, positioned us to repurchase 8 million shares for a total value of approximately $480 million in the quarter and through October 14. Since December 2012, we have repurchased over 22 million shares. And with the completion of our $850 million share repurchase authorization, our board has approved a new $1 billion authorization. In summary, on the financial perspective, we are extremely pleased with MSCI's overall performance in the first three quarters of 2015. On the personnel front and to better position MSCI to achieve its strategic goals, we recently announced that Baer Pettit will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer and Diana Tidd has been appointed Head of Equity Index Products worldwide reporting to Baer. We are very pleased to have leaders like Baer and Diana to step into these important roles. Now I will turn our attention to a long-term target, which I have set for ourselves on slide four, taking you through each of our segments and the growth we aspire to for each of them over the longer term. This is the way we are running the company. And the segments will provide you with greater transparency and insight into our performance as we have promised earlier in the year. We believe we are a growth company with a strong recurring revenue model, aspiring to achieve double-digit revenue growth over time. We have, in our view, multiple levers to drive that future growth. In our Index segment where MSCI's global equity indices are considered the gold standard for global investing, it is our long-term goal to grow our revenue annually in the low double-digits, with adjusted EBITDA margin ranging from 68% to 72%. This range is below the margin level that we are reporting today for Q3. This is our long-term target, which reflects the impact of important investment that we may need to make to enhance and expand our market position and indices, just as we have done in the past by differentiating ourselves in new area, so just Factor Indexes. We're excited to report and we believe our Analytics segment is now on the path to both revenue growth and improved profitability as a result of the steps we have taken this year and the steps we will continue to take in 2016. It is our goal to move our revenue growth to the high single-digits over time. It is also our long-term goal to move adjusted EBITDA margins to the 30% to 35% range. Our clients rely on Analytics products to meet the demands of an increasingly complex and global multi-asset class investment world and, therefore, presenting us with significant opportunities to serve them and to grow our business. Lastly, in our All Other segment, which consist of our ESG and Real Estate products, we see high growth opportunities in our ESG products and the potential to achieve higher levels of growth and improved profitability for our Real Estate products. Our long-term goal is that the All Other segment will be an engine of future growth for the company and we hope to grow revenues in this segment in the low double-digits. And over the longer term, we also would like to move our adjusted EBITDA margin from negative levels today, given our significant investments in this area, to the range of about 15% to 20%. So having reviewed our financial targets for each of our segment, what does this all mean for MSCI as a whole? If we reach our long-term financial target, we believe that we'll be in an even more competitively advantageous position in the future and we'll be better positioned to deliver deeper insight and superior tools to the leading investors in the world. If we can grow at a faster pace, we believe we'll be in a position to solidify and enhance market leadership in all our products including indices, equity and multi-asset class Analytics, and ESG and private Real Estate products. From a financial perspective, it is our goal that the respective contribution from each of the segments will help us achieve our long-term goal of low double-digit revenue growth and EBITDA margin of over 50% for the whole company. The trajectory to our goal of 50% adjusted EBITDA margin will obviously not be a straight line. For example, even though we reached 48% margin in Q3, we expect Q4 to be lower by some 200 basis points to 300 basis points. However, please keep your focus on the destination of 50%. On the slide five, we provide you with more detail on how we intend to achieve the adjusted EBITDA target in the Analytics segment. As you know all too well, this is an area of key focus for us. The focus for Analytics in the near term will continue to be on improving profitability. We have started by reducing the cost structure. We have achieved over $10 million of cost reduction so far in 2015, which annualize to about $20 million of this $25 million to $30 million that we hope to achieve. We have, therefore, made significant headway already in 2015 in achieving our cost target for Analytics products. On the slide seven, we provide you with a sense of how much the new Analytics management team led by Peter Zangari has accomplished in the last six months. The team has put the segment on a path to improve profitability and subsequent revenue growth. Lastly, jumping to slide eight, we highlight for you the strong track record of capital returns that we have established for MSCI. From our early days of capital return in 2012 until the present, we have returned over $1.2 billion in capital to our shareholders. By repurchasing over 22 million shares at an average price of $51.34 and paying a cumulative dividend of $85 million. We certainly hope to continue our strong record of returning capital to our shareholders over the long term. Now, I'd like to turn over to Bob, who will walk us through to the third quarter results in more detail.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Henry. And good morning to all of you on the phone. Now please turn to slide 10 where we'll begin my overview of our financial results. Our results this quarter were strong with a 7% increase in revenue and a 7% decline in adjusted EBITDA expenses. This drove a 26% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 740 basis points increase in our adjusted EBITDA margins to 47.9%, including the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Just a couple of quick comments on the results. Our results include higher interest cost from our bond offerings in the fourth quarter of last year and August of this year. In our GAAP numbers, we recorded a $6.3 million gain on the sale of an investment, which is excluded from our adjusted EPS. The 7% decline in weighted shares outstanding over the year added about $0.04 to our adjusted EPS. We anniversaried GMI in August and, as of the third quarter, it is considered part of our organic revenue stream in ESG. And lastly, just a comment regarding our tax rate. We are now in the process of aligning our tax profile with our global operating footprint. We believe this project will reduce our effective tax rate by a number of percentage points over the coming years. As we move forward, we will update you on our progress. And with slides that follow, we adjust our reported results for foreign currency fluctuations on our subscription revenue and cost, but we do not provide the impact on foreign currency fluctuations on our asset-based fees tied to assets under management, of which approximately two-thirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Before I get into the results, let me talk for a moment on the changes in our disclosures. The disclosures of our product segments and the related profitability are in line with the commitment we made at the beginning of the year to provide this information in the second half of 2015. In line with these enhanced disclosures, we spend considerable time focusing on the activities that drive our costs. Those activities are now reflected in our income statement and show what we incur to, one, support our existing products and clients; expand and grow our client relationships; and finally, develop and build new products. We believe this increased transparency will provide you with more insight into MSCI. Now let's turn to slide 11 where we will provide you with a bridge for the year-over-year change in our revenues by segment and revenue type. Total revenues increased $17 million or 7% to $269 million, but declined slightly from the second quarter 2015. The year-over-year increase was driven by an increase of $14 million or 7% in recurring subscription revenues and an increase of $4 million or 9% in asset-based fees, partially offset by lower non-recurring revenue. Adjusting for the negative impact of FX, our subscription revenues, which includes recurring subscription and non-recurring revenue, would have increased 8% overall, and Index would have increased 10% and Analytics and All Other would have each increased 7%. The $4 million or 9% increase in asset-based fee revenue to $51 million was driven by $32 billion increase in average AUM and ETF linked to MSCI indices to $418 billion as well as growth in non-ETF institutional passive funds based on MSCI indices. On a linked quarter basis, asset-based fees declined slightly, driven by a 5% decline in average AUM and ETF linked to MSCI indices. The linked quarter decline was mitigated by higher revenue from non-ETF institutional passive funds linked to MSCI indices. Turning to slide 12, we provide you with the year-over-year adjusted EBIDA expense bridge. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA expenses decreased $10 million or 7% to $140 million and declined $12 million or 8% compared to the second quarter of 2015. The impact of 2014 hires and same-store inflationary compensation noted here on the chart as net carryover inflationary increase as well as incremental severance was more than offset by a $7 million benefit in foreign currency exchange fluctuations and cost savings of $12 million, driven primarily by lower compensation and benefits as head count was lower by 133 year-over-year. Lower non-compensation cost also contributed to this decline. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, our adjusted EBITDA expenses would have decreased $3 million or 2%. The decline on a linked quarter basis was driven entirely by lower compensation and benefit expenses, reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals, lower wages and lower severance related to our efficiency efforts, and higher capitalization of compensation related to various strategic projects underway. On slide 13, we provide the run rate bridge for the quarter. Our reported run rate increased 6% to $1.062 billion consisting of a 6% increase in subscription run rate to $874 million and a 6% ABF run rate to $188 million. Compared to the second quarter 2015, however, run rate was flat, driven by a 7% decline in asset-based fee run rate and a 5% decline in average AUM and ETF linked to MSCI indices. Adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations, subscription run rate grew 8% year-over-year. In the quarter a combined $3 million increase in Index and record ESG sales was offset by a $4 million decline in Analytics and Real Estate sales. Lower Analytics cancellations, however, helped mitigate the decline in Analytics gross sales and aggregate retention rates increased to a record 95.3%. Overall, retention remained very strong at 95%. On slides 14 through 18, I'll walk you through our segment results. Let's begin with Index on slide 14. Revenues for Index increased 9% on a reported basis and the recurring subscription portion of Index revenues increased 11% on an FX-adjusted basis. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Index increased to 73%. We saw a continued strong growth in our core market cap Index products, factor and thematics, and derivatives as this growth continues to be supported by a growing pipeline of new products. Our core market cap Index products, factors and thematics and derivatives recorded strong year-over-year results and run rate growth. Growth in factors and thematic is helping to diversify our revenue base and is driving growth in both subscription and ABF revenue types. Open interest in MSCI Index-based futures and options increased to 1.6 million contracts, up 29% year-over-year. In terms of new products in the quarter, we launched three new Index families and we expanded 20 Index families, mostly factors. Year-to-date, we have launched 15 new Index families and 44 Index families have been expanded compared to 22 in the prior period. In the third quarter, ETF providers launched 47 ETFs based on MSCI indices compared to 19 in the prior year. Lastly, on the client side, we are continuing to focus on diversifying our client base and growing the new client base. On slide 15, we provide you with some detail around our asset-based fees. In the upper left chart, despite the spike in market volatility in August, our asset-based fee revenue remained fairly stable on a linked quarter basis due to higher revenue from non-institutional passive funds linked to MSCI indices. As shown in the upper right corner, third quarter inflows into ETFs remain positive in the quarter, despite depreciation of $48 million. As shown in the lower left corner, we have seen significant declines in emerging markets related AUM both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and while developed markets AUM is up year-over-year but declined on a linked quarter basis. Turning to lower right, the reported average basis points fee for ETF AUM linked to MSCI indices was 3.40 basis points at the end of the third quarter, down from the 3.51 basis points reported at the end of the third quarter and down slightly from the second quarter of this year. The decline year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter was driven by fee structure as well as the negative mix shift I mentioned earlier and assets that moved out of emerging markets and moved into developed market ETFs. On slide 16, we highlight our position as a leading index provider in ETF markets where we are number one year-to-date globally in terms of new assets gathered. Net flows in the ETFs through MSCI indices were $3 billion during the third quarter, down from $24 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date ETFs linked to MSCI indices captured $59 billion in net flows. Number one new assets in currency-hedged indices. Assets in ETFs linked to MSCI currency-hedged indices have more than doubled year-to-date, growing from $17 billion to $41 billion as of the end of the third quarter. Number one in new assets linked to factors. Despite lower assets in equity factor ETFs generated during the quarter, mainly due to negative market movement, there was positive demand for ETF linked to MSCI Factor Indexes. Assets in ETFs linked to MSCI Factor Indexes were $21.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $1.6 billion from the end of the second quarter. Year-to-date, ETFs linked to MSCI Factor Indexes have captured $9.1 billion of net flows. And lastly, we were number one in the total number of equity ETFs with 774. On slide 17, we highlight the financials for the Analytics segment. Revenues for Analytics increased 5% on a reported basis and 7% on an FX-adjusted basis and the adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 27%. To reiterate what Henry mentioned earlier, we expect that higher cost across all segments in the fourth quarter will lower the Analytics margin in a range of 24% to 26% in the fourth quarter. Now, the three primary use cases around which we are focusing our products and services in Analytics are, one, clients looking to differentiate themselves; two, operations in risk management infrastructure; and three, regulation. As we think about these use cases, what we are seeing from our clients is that they are spending to save money and they are spending to comply with the increasingly complex regulatory environment. Given this, the sales dialogue with most of our clients is focused on the operations and risk management use case as well as the regulatory use case. The federal banks with comprehensive capital analysis and reviewing on the CCAR and the proposed liquidity rules for asset managers by the SEC are the primary drivers of the regulatory chill in dialogue (26:02). As a result, we are seeing strong sales from our bank and large asset management segments with some weaknesses in hedge funds. And lastly for our segments, on slide 18, we have the All Other segment, which consist of ESG and Real Estate. Revenues for All Other increased 2% on a reported basis and 7% on an FX-adjusted basis and the adjusted EBITDA margin continues to improve. First, in terms of ESG, we are continuing to see a growing demand for deeper ESGs analytics and client portfolios across asset classes. In terms of sales, we had a very strong quarter, especially for the Americas where we secured global deals with several very large global asset managers. We also recorded our first sale in Japan to a large global asset manager. Carbon continues to be an area of strength. As a result of the strong collaboration between Index and ESG, the Montreal pledge deadline and the approach of COP21 in Paris appear to be drivers of increasing demand. Lastly, growth at ESG continues to be fueled by the addition of new clients. Turning to Real Estate, we're continuing to focus on improving the profitability of this important product. We've reorganized the sales team and are reviewing the product portfolio to eliminate non-core products. We are also in the process of upgrading our platform to improve the value proposition for our clients and drive revenue growth. And lastly for Real Estate, we are continuing to automate client data workflow, which drives increased efficiency. Turning to slide 19, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $993 million, which includes cash held outside of the United States of $102 million and as a general policy we maintain a U.S. cash cushion of approximately $125 million for operational purposes. We continued repurchasing shares in October for a total of approximately $135 million, so that leaves us approximately $630 million in excess cash to be deployed. It's important to point out that through today we've now completed 96% of our commitment to return $1 billion in capital to our shareholders by the end of 2016. Now with the completion of our $850 million authorization, our board has just approved a new $1 billion authorization under which we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the open market. The very high pace of repurchases in the quarter and in October was driven by the pullback in the stock price due to the spike in volatility. Though we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the open market, we expect that if the stock moves higher from these levels, the pace of repurchase will decline. And if it moves lower, the pace will increase. Our goal is to deploy the remaining cash in a manner that generates the highest return for shareholders. We will continue to regularly evaluate the method to achieve this objective with our board. And as of October 22, shares outstanding were 102.7 million. On slide 20, we provide you with the progression of our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA expense guidance. Through third quarter of 2015, the annualized foreign exchange benefit that we have registered relative to our original full year 2015 guidance of $620 million to $640 million based on year-end 2015 plan rates is approximately $7 million. The primary driver, therefore, of this decline with the current range of $595 million to $600 million is the cost savings that we have achieved based on the deliberate actions we have taken to reduce head count and improve overall cost efficiency. On our second quarter call, we expected that we would see increased costs for new hire, higher technology infrastructure spend, higher professional fees and severance, and will keep us at the low end of our previously stated range of $620 million to $640 million. These costs came in lower than expected in the third quarter due to two factors. First, there was an element of timing for higher cost of new hire, professional fees and technology cost were delayed and we now expect these costs to come in, in the fourth quarter. Second, the actions that we have taken in the first half of 2015 by reducing head count and prioritizing projects have had a more significant impact on the quarterly run rate of expenses. In fact, of the $24 million to $29 million in cost savings that we expect this year, Analytics represent a little more than $10 million of that savings. And while we do expect to see incremental cost flow through in the fourth quarter based on our guidance, the fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA expenses are now expected to be between $148 million and $153 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. As Henry mentioned earlier, we expect that we'll have a negative 200 basis points to 300 basis points impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. One final comment on cost. The long-term goals that Henry outlined earlier involve solid growth in revenue as well as a sustained cost discipline. In the near term, we now aspire to annual cost growth at the low end of the 5% to 7% range we provided you with in the second quarter on a constant currency and constant portfolio basis. We believe this level of annual expense growth will enable us to strike the right balance between investing to fuel future growth and maintaining strong cost discipline. On slide 21, I'll close out the prepared remarks on our updated guidance for full year 2015. As I just stated, we now expect adjusted EBITDA expenses to come in between $595 million to $600 million. Interest expense for the year is now expected to be approximately $63 million. Free cash flow is now expected to come in between $255 million and $270 million for 2015, CapEx is now expected to be in the range of $45 million to $50 million, reflecting lower technology infrastructure spending. And finally, the effective tax rate is still expected to come in between 35% and 36%. Now, with that, I'd like to open up the line for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. And thanks for providing the additional disclosure, especially on the margins of the segments. I am going to skip over Index just because that was a really strong number and in line with the target anyway. Just on Analytics, just the run rate in the quarter ticked down a little bit on a constant currency basis, so I just wanted to know, if you could remind us of some of the initiatives that will drive you to the higher growth rate that you're looking for?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Toni, it's Henry. We had a slightly soft quarter in Analytics sales, but it is just a quarter – there was clearly a lot of volatility in the market. And when that happens, clients are focused intensely on the volatility and so transform our decisions about budget and closure of contracts and the like slow down a little bit. Our pipeline of Analytics is actually pretty extensive. And therefore that gives us optimistic caution or cautiously optimistic that what our sales pace will pick up. In terms of what are we doing to drive that even higher structurally, not just with the existing product line, there is a slew of new product development that has taken place in Analytics from the launch of a lot of new models in the equity risk model area to particularly the revamping of our applications with a new interface and new layer of application on top of some of our other applications. We are hoping that we can launch that in a selective basis in the first quarter of 2016 and over time we hope that that's going to drive Analytics higher. One other key area that we have been focusing on in the last six months with the management team Analytics is how do we really look at use cases in our client and drive strong sales efforts in each one of these use cases. And I think as Bob mentioned, we are very much focused on investment differentiation. So you go to a client and say our tools are going to help you build better performance. The second one is operational efficiencies, the complexity and global nature on multi-asset class nature of portfolios are creating significant complexity in our clients operationally and we want to drive our products to help them reduce that complexity and create efficiencies. And the third one is surely regulatory compliance. So all of those efforts – so I gave you a little bit of an answer on the short term in terms of the sales and the pipeline and longer-term why we are very optimistic about the sales this product.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then in All Other, it looks they are non-recurring revenues and sort of a drag there on the growth rate, can you just remind us what's included in that non-recurring part? It looks like the run rate trend has been sort of low double-digits on a constant currency basis. Thanks.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: In the Other side, when we have ESG and Real Estate, and the Real Estate tends to dominate the one-times, and we've spent a lot of time trying to move those more into recurring and we have seen some tapering off, but with the platform we're expecting us to be able to generate more product capabilities across the regions that are out there, but most of those are coming out of the Real Estate segment. And they tend to be one-time sales, one-time subscriptions that are out there.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And just lastly, just wanted to see if you have any updated thoughts on capital deployment, now that you have almost $1 billion cash on hand, so is there any areas of M&A that you are more focused on? Thanks.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: We look at – we try to bring it down to where our cash is now. Obviously, we continue to deploy cash. All the way past through the quarter end, we used the rest of our $800 million authorization. We got about $600 million cash on our balance sheet that's available. Acquisitions are obviously a good deployment of capital that can be done either synergistically or they can be done to filling gaps or they can be done to excel capabilities like most recently we have had a few. But we still – we're looking for the highest return and we have been deploying capital through buyback. With the $1 billion authorization, as I indicated earlier, we intend to continue to buy that back until opportunities come up our way that are different, but the highest and best deals is what we're focused on.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. On the new $1 billion buyback plan, what are your thoughts on timeline there? Is there a date that you have to complete a buy or just what – how fast do you think that that will get deployed?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: We're going to – we kept it open and we're committed to returning. It's just we're going to basically face ourselves over the course of the next few periods. As I said, Chris, we're way ahead of our original commitment of returning the $1 billion. We are 96% on that initial $1 billion and we remain committed to returning that and using our recently issued debt to the highest and best use.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. I mean, I'm just thinking through this bottoming. If it was going to be longer-term in terms of the timeline for usage, why would you raise $800 million of debt, given that you could buy back that $1 billion over a period of year or a little bit over a year with free cash and revolver, which probably would be a lot cheaper?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Well, it goes back to when you look at our balance sheet, and when we talked about at the second quarter working with the board, we felt the more appropriate level of leverage was 3 times to 3.5 times was better matched our cash flows. And we had a great opportunity to raise $800 million, as Henry mentioned, extremely efficiently in the first part of August before the volatility struck. And we've always remain committed, Chris, that we are not here to store cash. We are here to deploy it as efficiently and effectively as we can. And I think our record in the third quarter here shows that we did deploy a lot of capital as the market moved and the volatility enhanced, we were able to efficiently buyback a lot of shares, 8 million shares to be specific since the beginning of the third quarter.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And also look as Bob indicated – our plan is to try to be in a market with lower levels of share price and be in the market that did less with higher levels of share price. So I think the pace which we affect our program will depend quite a lot on where things turn out.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. And then, just a couple more quick ones, on – Bob, did you give the ETF yield in the asset base fees?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, 3.4 basis points which was down and 3.43 basis points and 3.51 basis points year before on a linked and year-over-year basis.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: It's on the slides too, Chris.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then, on Index, just what kind of investments do you guys need to make there to enhance and expand, as you said, margin targets there just given where you are at seem relatively conservative, so just want to understand the incremental investments.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I don't know, I mean, 70-plus% EBITDA margins don't seem conservative to me. I think that – if you look – I think that we have a phenomenal franchise in Index, phenomenal. And honestly, I mean, as management and shareholders, you got two choices, you either melt the franchise and over time you reduce your market leadership or you invest in new franchise and you continue to feel this revenue growth and this level of profitability. We are in the latter camp which is a balance between how much you won and can invest on annual basis. But there is still – if you think about there are three areas where equity indices are – can be very profitable for active management, passive management and derivatives. So in active management, you have to reach out more and more customers, deeper into the market cap areas, so for example into small cap indices, you want to reach into new territories like China and Saudi Arabia and other places like that. As they open up to global investing. On passive management, in addition to the market capital indices, you want to invest in factor indices and thematic, which is a big revolution we are at the forefront of that. You got to put some investments in there. And thirdly, an area that it's been small for us is derivatives, listed futures and options around the world. We feel extremely excited about that area over time from a small base, because we have demonstrated in the last few years that the market for multi-currency Index underlying futures contracts has – it can be very successful. And we did that obviously with our partners at ICE with the emerging market Index futures and the EAFE futures and in Europe with our partners at EUREX with the world futures and the likes of what – we would like to make some investments in there to see if we can build a fairly large third leg of revenue and profitability for our business.
Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, hey, good morning everyone. And again thanks for all the disclosures. I actually want to go back to page 5 and the Analytics long-term target. I think some of this was mentioned already, but maybe you can flush it out a little bit more. First of all, when you talk about long-term target, what are the timelines of some of these buckets here in particular when it comes to the cost savings, I mean, are those very near-term what's a little bit more backward loaded? And then coming back to, I think something that was asked earlier, how confident do you feel about the ability to drive that incremental growth at the same time as you are cutting costs? Thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, look we purposely left the timeline a bit flexible because clearly nobody has a crystal ball, right, as to what the future can predict and the pace by which we can achieve things. The second important component of this slide is that, it starts with the restructuring of the costs, the efficiencies of the product line and therefore you noticed that the first column on the slide on the left is long-term cost savings, which we are very much on our way to achieve. We already are on an annualized $20 million cost savings. We got $5 million to $10 million to go. And those are the things we have identified for now and clearly but the management team Analytics is also not going to stop there, it's going to keep tightening and tightening in a way that creates further efficiencies. Then on the right-hand side, as you see, we put the incremental revenue target up there which we think are going to take a little longer than the cost savings. But we're confident that at least from today's vantage point that this – as I mentioned earlier that a significant amount of new product development and repositioning of the product and utilization of the use cases and the like can help was achieve these kinds of revenue profiles to get to an EBITDA – to say think about it a steady state from today's vantage point, EBITDA margins in the 30s%. Once we achieve those, it doesn't mean that's where we end. We then will have to reassess. Is that an appropriate margin? Can we do better? Can we not? I don't know, it's clearly too early to tell. Right now what we can give you is what we see in the horizon and then reassess when we get there as to what else can be done.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Maybe just to follow-up quickly on this one as well, you mentioned earlier kind of like the use cases and more focus on that, but I think what's been noted a couple of times is that the sales growth is still lagging in that segment. So maybe just getting beyond some of these use cases, what would you say is like the biggest thing that's missing and if its macro that's fine too, but what do you think is really the one component that you need to accelerate that sales growth?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think the -- first of all, I honestly want to ensure that I point out again that the softness in any particular quarter should not be a cause for alarm. And it's something that if we have a blow out quarter unless we tell you otherwise should not be a cause for euphoria. And so and we will be guiding you through that given the segment reporting on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I will not – if I were you, I would not read that much into the softness of this quarter. Remember, we had a huge amount of volatility. In the U.S. Labor Day was a week later and then so September was really three weeks to close a lot of deals. So the distraction by our clients and the late return of people from vacation and all of that may have caused some of the things to slip. And overall, for example, I mean, going into the final week of the quarter, there was like $4 million – this is not just in Analytics, but overall there was like $4 million that could have closed in the quarter. And that slipped into the final end quarter and that was about a 100% higher than in prior quarters. So that tells you a little bit of the some of this artificial sort of lines that we put into quarters. What is very important is that the pipeline is pretty good, so we feel very good about the pipeline. Now, the timing of closing all of that again is a question of working with our clients and getting approval for their purchases and so on and so forth. So we feel pretty good now. My keen focus – and the team's keen focus on the various use cases is so that we rally the resources of the firm to achieve the objectives of the client. Said it differently, instead of selling products and features and applications and models and the like we're trying to flip a lot of that completely and say solve use cases. So, okay, a client wants 10% better cost efficiencies in the way they are managing their risk – their risk management effort, how do we achieve that with our tools, let's work backwards from that. Our client is looking for a 50 basis point or better improvement in their portfolios, what can the tools do to achieve that and so on and so forth. Or worse yet, right, the clients are with a huge deadline by regulators to provide certain reports and the like, how can we rally our resources to achieve that. So all of that gives us a good amount of optimism. But again, this revenue, the sale process and the revenue process initially will be slow and we hope that after a few quarters, it accelerates and over time it begins to move certainly more rapidly. But again, we have to see how it all goes in all of this. I want to make sure our expectations are right that we're really focusing on profitability first and launching the products that we – and utilizing the benefit of all the products that we have launched and the ones that were coming out and then focusing on increasing sales.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: All right, great. And I think people have been asking more than two questions, so I'm going to squeeze one more in, if that's cool. But, Bob, real quick on the tax rate, you gave us a little bit of a teaser on looking to reduce that. Can you also talk a little bit about the, A, the timeline and then, B, the kind of things that you're thinking about? Because I think there's been some things thrown around like moving the IP of indices and some things that sound a little bit more complex than other things I have seen in the past. So maybe give us a little bit more color about timeline and what you're actually trying to do here.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: The timeline is immediate. We have already started to take advantage of our global footprint and realigning where our leadership is, all aligned with what the tax and where we think the value is. In terms of selling IP and moving IP, that's a different conversation. Obviously, you want to explore that. But really, right now, it's really aligning where the value is on our footprint. And that will happen probably you will see it in our operating rate, it is actually pretty strong. We had some discrete items this quarter reflective of state items that could benefit on the sale of our investment to offset that, but we did inside of the tax rate have some benefit in the third quarter and will be continuing ongoing as it becomes more meaningful. When we talk about guidance next year, we will talk more about what we think those rates should be.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Your line is now open.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Hi. It's Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Few questions. Just first, maybe I've missed this. Can you talk through the path to the higher margins in the All Other segment please?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: In terms of the margins in the Other segment, the direction of them? Vincent, I am sorry, I just want to make sure – we didn't hear you well, Vincent.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: How do you expect to get to the 15% to 20% from where you are now?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: There's two factors. I will start up and Henry can finish it. You can see that we were actually moving in that direction. You can see – and the best way to look at the Other segment, Vincent, in my view, is look at it on a year-to-date basis. You can see that the revenues on an absolute basis grew about 2.6% or about $1.6 million. But what we saw was efficiencies that I referred to on the Real Estate expenses actually on a year-to-date basis has declined, driving the margin to coming more towards a breakeven and, as I talked about, ESG is growing significantly. Obviously, the reported run rates in ESG are obviously down because now we have annualized GMI, so you're starting to see them in the high-teens, closer to 20%. That's one factor. The other factor that help drive the growth is the platform I referred to on Real Estate and not only will provide a better client experience, it will provide more efficiency as well as a platform to grow on. That's what we see going forward.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. Thanks. And then second question. Just curious on the segment reporting methodology you put out today. So you've chosen to allocate shared cost as opposed to splitting them out. How much did you have in terms of these indirect or shared costs?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: I think – let me – the question is, when we went through all of the cost base, we had several dedicated costs. More than half of our costs tend to be dedicated and aligned around the products, we tend to become more corporate and share a lot of the infrastructure costs, but we see it (54:33) through either time tracking or allocations. Costs that you see here from a contribution margin defined as what I would say is our cost of revenues, inclusive of our selling and our R&D, those are really aligned around the products. The overhead or general and administrative tends to be Henry and Bob and some of the other infrastructure that's out there. And our goal on that is to keep it low. Right now 7.4% was the general and administrative cost of our revenues. We continue to drive that out to be as efficient as we can and continue to maximize the gross profit line and that comes through a combination of specialists within the product as well as being able to allocate the full corporate benefit and the footprint that we have out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.
Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. As we look at the long-term guidance and long-term target out there, I know you have, well, let's say, a year on that. But should we be thinking about that as a two-year or three-year target or just more of a 10-year target that you guys are thinking of in your heads?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Keith, I mean, 10 year is an eternity for us. So we're for sure not focused on that. So we're growing closer to the first range. But again, we left it totally flexible at this point because we can't tell you how all of this will evolve. We can't tell you how market conditions and how product development efforts and so on and so forth. So again, we – it's not clear if it was that we have a specific set of targets and – I mean we – a timing on the targets. What we have is target that we want to achieve. And if it takes a while, it take a while. If they come sooner, they come sooner. But we don't have a specific timeframe set where we're going to hurry, but we don't want a specific timeframe, so we can't provide that to you.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: And also, you can see we demonstrated some immediate action on the cost, as Henry referred to about what we've done in Analytics.
Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Yeah. Okay. And then as I think about the All Other segment, I guess, is that the area where you have the most opportunity for improvement? It sounds like your Index and Analytics segments, it's operating as expected or perhaps even better than you're planning on perhaps even a year ago. But in the All Other, especially in the Real Estate area, something you're perhaps lagging there where you're hoping to be? And, I guess, is there any acquisition you're going to make in the area or is that an area you just need some more time and effort be able to get there?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So the way to think about the enterprise is that we are already at a steady state of EBITDA margin in Index. It will go up and down, obviously, within the range and beyond depending on certain conditions. We are ramping up the margin on Analytics and the milestone is in the 30s% at some point and to what happens after that. And then thirdly, this Other area, Other product category that's out where we're putting a lot of our new investments that we think will have a high revenue growth, but we need to have meaningful investments in them and, at the beginning, we will run them out of deficit. But over time, we want to make sure they're breakeven and then contribute to the overall profitability of the firm. So, therefore, where we're focused on in efficiencies and profitability are in Analytics is to get to where we want to be. And within the Other category is the Real Estate because it's an area that we've been investing and restructuring and reengineering the whole product line after the acquisition so we can bring it back to a positive contribution to profitability of the firm. Acquisitions, they can happen in any one of our businesses, and we look at them all the time, for sure, especially smaller acquisition, but I think I want to emphasize that the footprint that we have at MSCI is enough for now to make us focus on organic growth. So the vast majority of our efforts at MSCI are organic growth with selective bolt-on expansion acquisitions. That's where we are right now. Obviously, if anything change, then we will report that.
Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW. Your line is now open.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Looking at the P&L and the R&D expense line, I mean, it's up about 10% year-to-date, but certainly down meaningfully quarter-to-quarter and year-on-year in the third quarter. Just wondering how to think about that going forward? I mean, was there just an acceleration of development cost in the first half of the year and should we be thinking about sort of the remainder of the year being similar to what we saw in the third quarter?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: A couple of things. One is R&D is what we're spending on for the future, okay, as opposed to cost of revenues to support the existing book of business, and selling and marketing to grow the existing clients and new clients acquisition. Here, two things. In the first half of the year, recall we talked about the technology project associated with RMA that we decided to spend away from because the benefits that we had initially identified had diminished and we had a write-off of about $3.5 million to $4 million in the first quarter, which would have inflated the first quarter, and you can see that in historical results and also that inflates it on the year-to-date basis. I did talk about the linked quarter decline coming down significantly. And one of the components was deferred software, which is on catch-up basis in the third quarter that would actually have deep – just sort of depress the expense or reduce the expense for the linked quarter. So you would see that come back up slightly in the fourth quarter. One of the contributing factors that we referred to is slightly increasing costs in the fourth quarter.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: When you think about that, it's just under 6% of revenues. I would say on a more normalized basis, that probably would be higher – slightly higher, closer to the 6.5%, 7% that you've seen historically once it gets full up and running.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then just looking back a couple or thinking back a couple of years ago, I know you guys talked about the investment that you needed to make in the business to kind of ensure that you saw sustainable revenue growth going forward. And that was one of the reasons that margins had come down at levels that they hadn't. Sort of that in prior year before that, you were less focused on that, and that's the reason you saw the margins are actually at current levels about now. Just wondering how we think about this going forward and in terms of the need for increased spend and the ability to drive those margins up to that 50% level that you talked about longer term?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. If you think about the investment plan that we went through in 2013 and 2014, which was very important to us, we needed some investment, catch-up or step-up investments in Index, which we achieve and you noted in the segment and, therefore, the EBITDA margins in Index went down to about 64%, 69% because we needed that. We definitely needed a meaningful amount of investments, particularly on our data centers and our sort of running of the infrastructure of the applications that we provide in Analytics. There were investments there in significantly upgrading the leadership of the technology team in all aspects of that and, obviously, a lot of investment in capital expenditure with the data centers and software and things like that and new applications that we're building. So we're benefiting from that investment in this space right now. There were significant investment in servicing our entire client base around the world, so there was a step-up for that. So as we look at that period, that's a period that has benefited us in getting the retentions rate so high and in stabilizing and now growing the Analytics product line and in maintaining our leadership in the Index franchise. So where we are now is at a point in which that step-up of investment has served us well. And we are now on a normal step-up basis as opposed to a big step-up, a normal cadence every quarter every year, which tells us that this is pretty sustainable for a period of time. Now if there were to be a different perspective of that and we need another rash of investments in the future, which we don't see in the immediate future or medium term future, we'll come back to you, but we feel pretty good about what we did. It was painful, obviously, and describing it all to you, and the share price did not benefit from that and the like, but there are times in which you got to do that in order to make sure that the long-term value proposition of this business to our client is great and to our shareholders and continue to drive shareholder value.
Operator: And at this time, I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Stephen Davidson for closing remarks.
Stephen C. Davidson - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you very much for your time today, your interest in MSCI, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Davidson, please go ahead.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Sabrina. Good day and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for second quarter 2015. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we've prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the Risk Factors on forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our core performance. You'll find a reconciliation of the equivalent GAAP term in earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures on pages 28 to 32 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer and Bob Qutub, Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share with you our second quarter 2015 results. Please turn to slide 3 in the presentation for an update on the quarter. We delivered solid financial performance with higher levels of profitability driven by solid revenue generation and a strong cost discipline resulting in double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and continued margin expansion. Despite some heavy currency headwinds, adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.7%, an increase of over 200 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. This is the highest margin recorded by MSCI since the third quarter of 2013. We're on course with the execution of our growth strategy and we're seeing the returns from our investments. In Index, we continue to extend our product set to equity investors across segments and markets. We're selling more to our existing customers and we're building on our momentum in the factor or smart beta space with new factor index introductions. In our asset-based fee products, we're focused on extending our research innovations and capabilities and new product development and we're seeing positive results with the leadership position that we have recorded in the first half of the year. More equity ETFs are linked to MSCI indices worldwide than any other index provider. Our investment in client surveys and consultants continues to pay us back with very strong client loyalty. Our aggregate retention rate in the quarter was 94.2%. Higher retention rates have bolstered our total net new sales offsetting a range-bound gross recurring sales of approximately $30 million per quarter. On analytics, we're continuing to take actions aimed at driving this product line to higher levels of performance. I will provide more detail about our plans later in my presentation, but for now, I would like to reiterate what I've said in prior calls. We're not satisfied with our performance in this area and we're taking aggressive steps to improve. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Since we launched the enhanced capital return program in September of 2014. We have reacquired a total of almost 8 million shares. 2.2 million shares were reacquired in the second quarter comprising of a million shares in open market repurchases and 1.2 million shares from the completion of the ASR which brought the total shares for that ASR program to 5.7 million shares. Subsequent to the close of the quarter and through Friday, July 24, last Friday, we repurchased another 1.2 million shares at an average price of $63.24. I'm also pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 22% increase in our regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.22 per share. Please turn to slide 4, where we show a set of KPIs that we believe are leading indicator of growth in the future. The first section of this slide highlight the drivers of higher performance subscription revenue growth over time despite the quarter-to-quarter variances that we saw in the quarter. Policy benchmark mandate for asset owners were down 10% year-over-year but are running around 2% at year-to-date. New index families launched during the quarter were at 14% and our ESG client base increased 34% to over 800 new clients, primarily as a result of the GMI acquisition. In the next section, we highlight the sources of increased assets flows that lead to higher asset base fees. In the second quarter, the total cumulative number of MSCI-linked equity ETFs increased 15% and the number of new MSCI-linked equity ETF licenses decreased about 29% year-over-year but are running 34% higher year-to-date compared to 2014. Active and passive assets tied to MSCI factor indexes increased 22% but remained relatively flat when compared to the first quarter. Quarter-end AUM linked to MSCI indexes amounted to $435 billion, up 15%. Finally, listed futures and options trading volumes based on MSCI indexes increased 11% to almost $10 million contracts. You saw that we're breaking out our asset-based fees between the ETFs and the institutional passive and now the listed futures and options because this is an area of increased focus for us to drive further growth in our indexes. At the bottom of the slide, you also see the highlight that we provide on the drivers of higher portfolio management analytics growth. Run rate from the new equity risk models that we have introduced over the past several quarters stands at $24 million, up 41% from $17 million in the second quarter of last year and up slightly from the first quarter of this year. On the next page, slide 5, I would like to make a few comments about our performance products of index, real estate and ESG. Global investing trends and MSCI's leading global equity index family continue to drive demand for our MSCI indices, our existing indices and also our new indices. In the quarter, we expanded nine existing index family with [indiscernible] one new data module and we made an important enhancement to our core modules. Our investment in asset-based fee products especially ETFs linked to MSCI indexes continue to pay dividend in terms of strong inflows. I will touch up on this trend in more detail on the next slide. Our focus continues on a smart beta or factory investing to leverage our leadership in this space and secure a strong position in a market that is relatively fragmented now and with no clear leader. We're laser focused on leveraging our deep research capabilities in our equity analytics part and our equity index part to continue to develop factor indexes and win market share. And on the new factor indexes we released for our ETF clients during the quarter were prime value indexes, total shareholder yield indexes and buyback yield indexes. Our thematic and custom indexes are also seeing a strong year-over-year growth as clients seek new ways to differentiate their offerings in the marketplace. In our real estate products, after a period of significant investment in infrastructure, we're turning our attention to launching new products and re-aligning our client coverage themes for maximum sales and efficiencies. This week, we introduced a new real state analytics portal that gives our clients on demand access to data analytical content from us. Furthermore, we're continuing to leverage our real estate data with the launch of our new real estate modules which includes a full suite of real estate indexes. For the first time ever, investors around the world in private real estate will have a global market data set and a family of indexes that all produce use the same methodology, providing us with a very strong competitive advantage in the real estate marketplace. We're very pleased with the growth we're seeing in ESG as the product line continues to move into the mainstream of the investment process. We launched ESG ratings during the quarter which is a major milestone after the acquisition of GMI. We're seeing more demand for our ESG data to create indexes such as low carbon, governance indexes and impact investing indexes. In the lower right of this slide, we highlighted run rate by region of all the performance products and we show that the growth in Asia has been meaningful and this is an area that we're keenly focused on for both performance and analytics products. On slide 6, we highlight the strength of our competitive position as a leading index provider to the ETF marketplace. The global equity ETF industry stood at $2.3 trillion in AUM at the end of the quarter, of which a record $435 billion was linked to MSCI indexes, representing about 19% of the market. There were over 750 equity ETFs based on MSCI indexes as of the end of the second quarter, more than any other index provider in the world. Globally and year-to-date, MSCI ranked Number 1 in net new asset flows into equity ETFs. A total of $44 billion of net new assets flow into equity ETFs globally in the second quarter, of which $24 billion went to ETFs based on MSCI indexes. Year-to-date, about $97 billion has flown into equity ETFs and $56 billion has gone through ETFs based on MSCI indexes or representing around 58% of the net new flows. Currency hedge ETFs have experienced significant growth over the last few quarters. In this past quarter, they experienced about $18 billion in net new assets, down from $28 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2015. Of that $18 billion in net new flows, over $10 billion or about 56% went into currency hedge ETFs linked to MSCI indexes. In just six months, global ETF assets linked to MSCI currency hedge indexes have increased by 156% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, going from about $16 billion to about $41 billion. Additionally, there are now 69 currency hedged ETFs globally linked to MSCI indexes, more than the next three highest index providers combined. Turning to page 7, I would like to provide an update on the key [Technical Difficulty] for analytics products. Favorable industry trends are serving as a solid foundation for us to improve the performance of this product line. Asset management firms are increasingly offering specialized investment products to differentiate themselves from the competition as evidenced by the growth in factors, multi-asset class solutions and levels of quantitative investing. The rising complexity of the global investment process for many of these asset management firms is requiring significant operational and risk management enhancement in their internal processes. An increase in regulatory requirement are necessitating a strong analytics, flexible reporting infrastructure and timely and high quality data generation. So, we're seeing increasing levels of interest by our asset manager clients in deeper relationships with MSCI to provide them with operational and risk solutions and we're engaging all these clients in a way that we can provide those solutions to them. The second quarter saw strong record for product enhancement and developments in analytics. We delivered Barra Portfolio Manager 3.11 and BarraOne 3.11. We have made important strides with the creation of an analytic content growth management team in quarter so we can deliver that content not only through the MSCI applications but also directly to clients and through third party applications. During the quarter, we delivered the medium Horizon U.S. Dollar market model, our revised or renewed Taiwan equity model and we also delivered a new revised Barra Open Optimizer 8.2. We created [indiscernible] that we call factor analytics which is basically bringing together the two analytics platform that are based on Barra factors and that is BarraOne and Barra Portfolio Manager to deliver higher value to our clients and to try to create efficiencies by merging these two applications of BarraOne and Barra Portfolio Manager. Lastly, we're continuing to focus on managed services for our clients which extends and strengthens our current offering to help them become more operationally efficient. In the lower right of the chart, we also highlight the growth that we're seeing in analytics products in Asia as I mentioned before. On slide 8, we provide more details about the actions that we're taking going forward to drive analytics to higher levels of performance. Our plan to improve analytics is focused on four areas; revenue growth, increased product development, cost efficiencies and a laser focus on clients. So, revenue growth will come from better serving client use cases, monetizing our analytic content as I mentioned before and creating a new architecture, a new client interface that will provide our clients access to all of our existing applications. We would also place a new focus on managed services which I mentioned earlier. As I said, our clients continue to be under intense budgetary pressure which is forcing them to continue to be more efficient and we can provide solutions to them to achieve that. We're looking to extend our capabilities for clients who are interested in outsourcing non-core operational risk and portfolio management capability. We're aiming towards a unified and coherent product development effort that will be focused on client use cases as well as the delivery and accessibility of our content. The new architecture, a new client interface that I mentioned that we're developing will help to consolidate this parent applications that we have and focus on use cases of our clients. The third area is cost efficiency. This will be implemented through a rigorous expense reduction and a unified product development effort as I mentioned earlier. Lastly, we have a blue chip client base. We have been leveraging our senior account managers to grow our largest and more important client relationships to provide them with the set of content and applications that are going to help them solve their operational efficiency issues and help them differentiate their investment offerings. We're confident that by focusing on these four areas we will be well positioned to return analytics to a stronger revenue growth and much higher levels of profitability. On slide 9, we highlight the first half trend for company-wide sales for 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the positive impact that our investment in client service has had on reducing cancels and driving higher retention rate. Total net new sales were up 24% when you compare the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2013 but were relatively flat when compared to the first half of 2014 or last year. This growth compared to the first half of 2013 was driven by an 8% increase in sales combined with a 15% decline in cancels allowing more of our sales to convert into run rate and into revenue. While we're very pleased with this development, sales have been range-bound over the past few quarters and therefore there are limits to the levels of retention that we can achieve to be able to add to the run rate. Given this, we're taking significant steps to try to re-accelerate this gross sales effort. First, our senior account managers are critical to the success of this effort and we're really relying on them and pushing on them to be able to establish C-level relationships that are going to help us make this sales more easily. Our client relationship model in the past has been based on especially catering to a user in the organization and not as much in developing those C-level relationships. So, in addition to that relationship that we have at the user level move back to the C-level and make our enterprise-wide risk management sales more effective. The next step is obviously the consolidation of the analytics sales and coverage team that we believe that by doing that we're going to be able to have efficiencies and hopefully also increase the level of sales. Again, all of this in an effort to try to break out of this range-bound levels of sales or gross sales in the $30 million range so far in the past few quarters. Slide 10, we highlight the levers that we believe will drive revenue growth, higher levels of profitability and margin expansion in the quarters to come. Higher levels of revenue growth will come from continued double-digit growth in index and step up in analytics to high-single digit revenue growth, continue the strong double-digit growth in ESG and a pickup in growth in real estate. While we grow our revenues, we will also continue to remain laser-focused and disciplined on cost management with an operating target of 5% to 7% annual growth in adjusted EBITDA expenses on a constant dollar basis. The other lever that we're focused on to drive higher levels of revenue growth and profitability and margin expansion is a stronger contribution from our recent acquisitions. As we have stated, since our acquisition of real estate, we have been investing in the platform to upgrade the overall infrastructure, centralize the support functions, to set the foundation to really globalize this business. We're largely finished with the investment phase and now we're looking to consolidate all that investment and begin to launch new products and hopefully move to a break from slight loss and to breakeven and then better profitability on real estate in the quarters to come. The last two levers are related to our effective tax rate to returning capital to shareholders. We're in the process of doing long-term tax planning and are reviewing our global footprint and how best to realign it to become much more tax efficient. As we have shown this quarter, we continue to be highly committed to returning capital to shareholders and over time we will ensure that we're returning capital in the most effective and efficient way possible. Given this, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the open market, buying more shares at lower prices and buying fewer shares as the stock moves up. Let me now turn over to Bob for a review of our financial profile.
Bob Qutub: Thanks, Henry and good morning to all of you on the phone call. Please turn to slide 11 for an overview of our financial results. We're including additional disclosures on the impact of currency fluctuations on our results to provide you with a more complete view of our operational performance. Our results this quarter were solid, with 12% adjusted EBITDA growth driven by solid revenue generation and strong cost discipline, with adjusted EBITDA expenses growing just 3% also benefiting from the strong currency tailwind. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 200 basis points from the prior quarter to 43.7% and as Henry pointed out, the highest margin since third quarter 2013. Income from continuing operations before taxes was up 4% and included the impact of higher interest costs from the issuance of our 5.25% coupon bond in the fourth quarter of 2014. The prior year's second quarter tax rate was low due to several one-time benefits. Excluding those one times, the effective tax rate in the quarter of the prior year would have been 35.6% compared to the 35.9% recorded in the current quarter. As Henry mentioned earlier, we're in the process of looking at opportunities to become more tax efficient by optimizing our operational and legal footprint. This work is underway, but we're not in a position at this time to provide any sense of magnitude or timing. We will update you more on our progress in the coming quarters. Adjusted EPS was up 2% to $0.56 per share, benefiting from a 4% decline in the weighted average shares outstanding year-over-year and stronger operating results. Before moving to the next slide, I want to comment on the impact of foreign exchange on our results. As we have previously indicated, foreign currency fluctuations have been a headwind for our subscription revenues and run rate. This headwind has been mitigated by a significant portion of our expense base that is denominated in foreign currency. Overall, approximately 15% of our subscription revenues are billable in non-U.S. dollars and nearly all of our ABF revenues are in U.S. dollars. Offsetting this is the fact that 40% of our EBITDA expenses are incurred in non-U.S. dollars. Throughout this presentation, we're providing the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations to our subscription revenues and run rate as well as to our expenses. However, we're not providing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our asset-based fees tied to average assets under management because while our fees for index-linked investment products are substantially invoiced in U.S. dollars, the fees are based on the investment product assets of which two-thirds are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. On slide 12, we provide you with a bridge for the year-over-year change in our revenues including the impact of foreign exchange on our subscription revenues. Total revenues increased $16 million or 6% to $271 million. The growth was driven by an increase of $9 million or 4% in subscription revenues which includes non-recurring revenues of $4 million and an increase of $7 million or 16% in asset-based fees. From a product perspective, the increase in subscription revenue year-over-year was principally driven by $11 million or 12% combined increase in Index and ESG revenue as well as $4 million or 3% increase in analytics revenues, partially offset by a decline in real estate revenue. Adjusting for $2 million negative impact from foreign exchange, analytics revenues would have increased by 5.4%. Real estate has also been particularly impacted by foreign currency fluctuations. Revenue decreased 26% on a reported basis but adjusted for $2 million negative impact from currency fluctuations and timing of report deliveries, the year-over-year change would have been positive. As you will recall from our first quarter call, real estate revenue in that quarter included the benefit of some early deliveries of Client Portfolio Analysis Service reports which historically have been delivered in the second quarter. The investments that we've made in the platform are allowing us to deliver reports with more regularity throughout the year which will smooth out the traditional second quarter seasonality of this product. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, recurring subscription revenues would have increased $14 million or 7%. The $7 million or 16% increase in asset-based fee revenue to $51 million was driven primarily by $82 billion increase in average AUMs and ETFs linked to MSCI indexes to $441 billion, as well as a modest increase in revenues from institutional passive AUM. Reported average basis point fee for ETF AUMs linked to MSCI indexes was 3.43 basis points at the end of the second quarter, down from 3.53 basis points reported at the end of the second quarter 2014 but up from 3.38 basis points at the end of the first quarter this year. The decline year-over-year was driven principally by fee structure which were impacting tiers as well as negative mix shift. The increase compared to the first quarter was driven by a positive mix shift. Let's turn to slide 13 and we'll provide you with year-over-year adjusted EBITDA expense bridge. The second quarter adjusted EBITDA expense increased $4 million or 3% to $152 million but declined 2% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Year-over-year increase was driven by higher compensation costs driven mainly from the impact of 2014 hires and same store inflationary compensation which is noted here on the chart as the net carryover inflationary increase. This increase was partially offset by a positive benefit of foreign exchange currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, our adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased $11 million or nearly 8%. It is important to note that while severance is going to be ongoing as we continue to strive for efficiencies, our underlying core expenses included here as net carryover and inflationary costs were only up 5%. Employees in emerging market centers increased to 51% in the second quarter of 2015 from 49% in the second quarter of 2014 and in line with 51% reported in the first quarter of 2015. And while the second quarter expense exit rate would indicate full year expense levels well below our 2015 adjusted EBITDA expense guidance range, for the remainder of the year, we're expecting incremental costs for new hires, technology infrastructure, professional fees and severance. And in terms of phasing this in for your models, for the remainder of 2015, we expect incremental cost to be more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. So with this in mind, we now expect our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA expenses to come in at the low end of the previously stated range of $620 million to $640 million and that would be on a constant currency basis going forward. Now turning to slide 14, let's take a look at the run rate bridge for the quarter. Our reported run rate increased 8%, consisting of 6% increase in subscription run rate to $862 million and 14% increase in ABF run rate to $201 million. Adjusting for foreign currency fluctuation, subscription run rate grew 9% year-over-year. First, in terms of subscription run rate, recurring sales in the second quarter of 2015 amounted to a total of $29.6 million compared to $29.1 million in the prior year quarter. Higher Index and ESG sales growth in performance and 6% growth in Risk Manager sales in analytics were offset by declines in sales in real estate in performance and portfolio management analytics. The decline in real estate recurring sales year-over-year was driven by timing and to a certain extent FX fluctuations and the decline in analytics was driven by lower equity model sales through Barra Portfolio Manager. Cancels amounted to a total of $12 million for the quarter, a decrease of 8% from the prior year quarter, resulting in net new recurring sales of $17 million or an increase of 9% year-over-year. The lower level of cancels drove year-over-year increases in retention across both performance and analytics products areas, resulting in an aggregate retention rate of 94.2% for the quarter and 94.3% year to date. Foreign currency fluctuations had a $22 million rolling fourth quarter negative impact on our subscription run rate. Also GMI acquired in August 2014 contributed $7 million to our run rate build year-over-year and we'll reach our one-year anniversary of that acquisition in August. So our third quarter results will reflect this change as GMI will then be considered part of our organic revenue and run rate. Now turning to ABF run rate, the $25 million increase was primarily driven by $57 billion period increase in ETF AUM linked to MSCI indexes on net inflows of $76 billion partially offset by net market depreciation of $19 billion. Growth in institutional passive AUM as well as higher futures and options trading volumes in contracts based on MSCI indexes also contributed to the year-over-year increase. On slide 15, let's take a look at our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $455 million which includes cash held outside of the United States of $97 million. We've been active in the markets repurchasing our shares after the end of the quarter for a total of approximately $75 million through the July 24. As general policy, we prefer to maintain U.S. cash buffer of approx $100 million to $125 million for operational purposes. Our gross leverage was 1.9 times based on our total debt of $800 million to our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. And one comment on leverage. On July 28, the Board of Directors had authorized the company to explore financing alternatives that could increase interest expense and the target leverage to 3.0 to 3.5. The timing success of any potential financing will be subject to, among other things, market conditions and the company's ability to obtain terms and conditions authorized by the Board. We will keep you updated. Capital return continues to be a strong point for MSCI with a total of 2.2 million shares repurchased in the second quarter through open market transactions and the maturity of the $300 million ASR. The average price for the repurchase of the 1 million shares was $61.90 in the second quarter of 2015. Subsequent to the closing of the quarter and through July 24, 2015, an additional 1.2 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $63.24. A total of $413 million remained open on the outstanding Board repurchase authorization and a total of approximately $500 million of the $1 billion capital return commitment has been realized as of July 24, 2015. Free cash flow year-to-date was $72 million, in line with the prior year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was lower than the prior year due to timing of expense disbursements. We spent $12 million in CapEx in the quarter, in line with the prior year and we're lowering our CapEx guidance which I will discuss in the next slide. And finally, our Board approved a 22% increase, as Henry mentioned, in our regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.22 per share from $0.18 per share which is payable on August 31 to holders as of August 17. Let's turn to Slide 16 and I'll give you some update on our guidance for the full year 2015. As I stated earlier, we expect adjusted EBITDA expenses to come in around the low point of the range of $620 million to $640 million, assuming at constant currency going forward. There is no change to our interest expense guidance which we expect to be approximately $45 million, unless, as previously noted, we increase our leverage this year. We have recently adopted free cash flow to replace cash from operating activity as a metric for cash generation. We expect that we will generate between $245 million and $275 million in free cash flow for 2015. Part of the refinement of our free cash flow guidance was our change in CapEx which we'll now expect to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million compared to the previous range of $55 million to $65 million, reflecting lower technology infrastructure spending. And finally, the effective tax rate is still expected to come in between 35% and 36% despite being at the high-end of the range in the current quarter and for the year-to-date period. Now turning to page 17 and in summary before we open up the line for questions, I'll wrap up the call by providing a summary of key takeaways. In the second quarter, we continue to execute our growth strategy and we delivered strong financial performance. We have developed a strong track record for returning capital to investors, as evidenced by $500 million that we have returned of our $1 billion commitment by the end of 2016. We have several levers that will drive our future growth including, continued strength in our core products, incremental revenue from the investments that we've made with our enhanced investment program, improved performance from our recent acquisitions and we're actively exploring opportunities to bring our tax rate more in line with peers and we're committed to returning capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll now like to open up the lines for your questions
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Toni Kaplan: You mentioned just now that the Board gave you authorization to explore options to increase leverage to 3.0 times to 3.5 times. Just want to clarify if that's gross leverage or net leverage and what the plan is for the capital? Is it basically just buybacks or something more?
Bob Qutub: It's based on gross leverage. And like I said, we're exploring the opportunities but we've consistently been returning capital. We'll make those decisions when and if we increase the leverage to 3.0 times to 3.5 times.
Toni Kaplan: And just as a follow-up, I wanted to reconcile really great expense management this quarter. It looks like you reduced headcount by about 100 people. So just wanted to reconcile cutting costs and managing expenses with the growth goals that you have increasing the sort of gross sales. So just wanted to find out, I guess, where the headcount reductions are that you're lowering your headcount and where you're planning to increase your headcount because you mentioned hiring plans?
Bob Qutub: We've been making headcount reductions in areas where we've been finding efficiencies that we referred to in the comments on the call here and your numbers are right, we did reduce and you've seen that evidenced by the severance. And so we're capturing those efficiencies, but we're actually using those efficiencies to ensure that we can maintain, whether its infrastructure, whether its stability or whether its growth in our products. So as we said that we will have some step up and redeployment over the course of the year, but it really has given us over the past year, the investment program, the opportunity to really capture some of the inefficiencies and turn them into productive growth.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is open.
Chris Shutler: The sequential improvement in the constant currency run rate, growth rate, I think it was about 8% for last couple of quarters. It was 9.1% this quarter. Given sales activity and retention rates were basically flat sequentially, should we view that as the vast majority of that was price. And then secondly, if you look at the total run-rate, how much incremental benefit do you think, let's say over the next one to two years, that you will realize from price? Is it more like a 100 basis points, 200 basis points, 300 basis points? How should we think about that, at least directionally?
Bob Qutub: I think going back to on a constant currency basis, you can see that our run rate has grown basically from 4% back in 2013 to now 8%. So, we've seen that from an improvement in our product suite. Go back earlier in that period, it was PMA along with the models and then we came out within 2013 and 2014. Price has always been a factor on our index side and as we get more and more confidence in the analytics products, we'll see pricing come into play. I wouldn't see it 50% or 300 basis points that you were talking about. But I would see us over time lighting into a higher percentage of our increase coming in from pricing but that would be gained by client confidence, that would be gained by new product innovation and as Henry talked about, the senior account manager program that we have in place.
Chris Shutler: On that last point, the senior account manager [indiscernible] talked about in the prepared remarks. Any changes that you guys have made to the incentive structure to make to -- to try to really push the accelerator on the growth?
Henry Fernandez: We have been for some time now reviewing the most appropriate way to incentivize our client coverage organization and we have a salary and bonus structure that is highly correlated always into sales performance. But we have that under review to see if there are more direct levers that we can put in place to provide even more alignment to that and we're still kind of in the middle of that process. We won't be able to really report back on that until sometime next year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm: Just wanted to come back to the comments you made early and get the question on the, I guess, the levering up the balance sheet more and I think, Bob, you then mentioned capital returns as probably one of the avenues. But can you maybe remind us a little bit like what the specific return are that you're looking at when you do that, so when you say evaluate buybacks versus dividend or maybe even do something on the M&A front again, what are the metrics we should be looking for and I guess I'm asking because you're stock is trading at an all-time high relative to the S&P and obviously the return at this valuation is getting limited and limited on buying back stock. So any additional color would be helpful.
Bob Qutub: Sure. I think in the past, Alex -- great question, we benchmark all of our investments on our weighted average cost of capital and the accretive value to that, whether it would be a buyback, whether it would be a total shareholder return through a dividend or whether it would be acquisitions externally or investments we make organically but the watermark would be our weighted average cost of capital and sure we have accretion to that for our shareholders.
Henry Fernandez: Yes, the other thing that I will say, Alex, is that -- we can't comment ourself on the valuation of our shares by the market. What we can comment though is that we see a significant amount of opportunities in our client base to continue to drive revenue growth even in the context of a mixed operating environment and then when you look at the mix of our products as I indicated. We think we're hitting in a lot of cylinders on the index product line, we have meaningful opportunities for expansion in revenue growth in analytics and in real estate and if you can continue the pace of growth in ESG, that should provide meaningful amount of revenue growth. Secondly, we went through that period of investments for about a year and a half, half of 2013 and 2014. We now feel we have the right sort of footprint and infrastructure and are now concentrating on that and really focusing on creating efficiencies out of that. So we believe that there is continue meaningful amount of margin expansion in our shares, in our business. So I don't know what the right price for that is but we're feeling pretty good about the company.
Alex Kramm: Maybe just then secondly and I guess picking up on the last comment and you mentioned also the sales you're not really satisfied with -- can you talk maybe about the competitive environment a little bit too, in particular, in analytics and maybe risks, specifically. Anything you're seeing there that makes it harder on the sales side, you think there's some competitors you would highlight that are being stronger than they were in the past or is it more the selling environment or your own doing that is lacking right now?
Henry Fernandez: I think it's the latter. Honestly, it’s -- we clearly are -- our company and our space or our industry is clearly in an area which is, we're creating a new market, we're creating a lot of new use cases. We're going into our client organizations and providing them with things that they weren't really doing before like as I said index in factor investing or a new sort of sophisticated risk management system or new ESG datasets or in the U.S., we're creating a new industry for real estate indexes and benchmarking and so on and so forth. So, a lot of our growth therefore is predicated on being able to provide -- understand the right use case, provide the right product and obviously convince the client at the right price to embrace a lot of these new offerings. Much less, much, much less driven by competitive dynamics in the marketplace, so we can go into more detail as to some level clearly a competition that exist in various product lines, but I think that the -- my overall message to you is that this range bound has to do with -- clearly its a mix environment, a lot of active managers around the world are not feeling that great, given that they're being squeezed on one hand by passive managers and on the other hand by real big large alpha highly concentrated portfolio managers and that type of investing. So, therefore, our job is to try to really galvanize the client base to help them achieve their investment differentiation, their operating efficiencies, their reporting requirements and all that and that's where we need to work harder at it in order to get out of this range that we've been at for a few quarters now that has us all rallied up.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Your line is open.
Vincent Hung: You've talked a lot about your disappointment with the range-bound sales. What is like an aspirational level of sales for you guys?
Bob Qutub: I'm not sure we have yet one. Our first step is break out of that range and we're not there yet and the pipeline is always good, it healthy. We had great engagement with clients and everything but we're not yet seeing that breakout and that's what we're trying to do, breakout of that recurring sales of roughly around $30 million or so but clearly we want to break out of that and we want to achieve sort of double-digit gross recurring sales growth, right. So gross recurring sales growth, that will make us a little more comfortable but again, historically, in the last few quarters, we have been trading around this range. We continue to be in that space right now. So, I don't want to raise any expectations, but we clearly wanted to highlight to all of you that we're not happy with that and we're really focused on trying to break out of it.
Vincent Hung: And what's the main pushback you're getting from clients?
Henry Fernandez: Clearly, clients are not extremely liberal with their budgets around the world. We're living in a highly cost conscious environment anywhere you go in the investment industry, but for the right things and the right use cases and the right solutions, clients will spend money and we've demonstrated that with our -- I think a lot really depends on -- its not just us pushing our sales to clients. We need to have the right level of engagement, especially on the enterprise-wide deals for risk management and performance and that's why we have formed this group of senior sales people to be focused at that C-level, the CEO, CIO, CRO level to try to help that sales process. We need in our applications. We have all the content. A lot of our content is great, especially in analytics. What we need to do is do a better delivery of that content through more fungible applications that can be accessed by the client through that content or throw the content delivered directly to the client for their own applications. So that it that effort that I mentioned about this new architecture and this new interface, this new platform that we'll be able to have the client access all of our other applications through that one in order to make it more fungible. So, we're taking a lot of steps. We're clearly pushing the salespeople, we're clearing pushing our senior account managers, we clearly are pushing our content, but I think a meaningful part of it is also breakthroughs that we have achieved in consolidating a disparate set of applications that we have from users to Barra Portfolio Manager to BarraOne to Risk Manager to Hedge Platform, we need to be able to put that in a more holistic fungible way to achieve the efficiencies that the clients is looking to achieve through the various use cases.
Vincent Hung: And just on your decision to increase the target leverage, just curious to get details around that. So, firstly, what kind of term structure would you look for in incremental debt and then, also would you look to get to the 3.0 times to 3.5 times sooner rather than later?
Bob Qutub: We've had a lot of deliberations with our Board over the last few years as to what the leverage is in a company like us that has a book of long-term assets that are producing great growth and profitability that are highly reliable and subscription based and so and so forth in order to balance out the leverage amount in the company and risk associated with that with the levering up your equity returns in a company like us. So we had a lot of those debates and discussion. [indiscernible] were concluded in the Board meeting this week in which the Board approved the increase in the gross leverage to somewhere between 3.0 and 3.5 and that what's just happened right. So we're now exploring based on that mandate what are the types of offerings that we can provide on the debt side to match those goals but it's early. We're still exploring all of that and we have to see what happens in the marketplace and what is convenient for us to achieve.
Vincent Hung: Can we expect that you do it all by fourth quarter?
Bob Qutub: It depends on market conditions, it depends on market environment, it depends on a lot of things. We clearly are really focused on it now, given all the work that we've done for the last couple years and given the approval by the Board. We can't really tell you until we see it [indiscernible].
Henry Fernandez: We remain very disciplined in terms of -- as my comments indicated that it's terms, conditions, it's all those factors that come into play.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi from Janney. Your line is open. 
Robert Simmons: This is actually Robert Simmons on for Joe. So, talk a little bit about where you think we're in the ETF growth cycle and also about the movement towards custom products?
Henry Fernandez: I think that in the U.S., we have filled out quite a lot of the matrix so to speak on market datas on ETFs. So, a lot of our effort and our client’s efforts are in more raising more assets based on a lot of those products and therefore the second major emphasis is in creating more specialized investment vehicles such as factors, such as currency hedge, ETF and so on and so forth. In Europe, there is in an earlier stage of development in the market data and we're also clearly pushing this beta. In Asia, the market is totally virgin. There's not a lot at this moment. We're extremely focused on developing that market in two ways. We're supporting our clients with our indexes and then explaining how those client can invest in ETFs in the U.S. and in Europe from Asia. And secondly, we're working with those ETF clients to be able to develop and launch local product in the region to also for the clients for investors in Asia to invest locally. So, it's a two prone approach.
Robert Simmons: Can you talk a little bit about the margin expansion trajectory going forward? After this year, like when do you think you might get to 46%?
Henry Fernandez: We continue marching deliberately towards margin expansion. We haven't given a cap or we haven't given a timeline but we did say margin expansion through 2015 and we gave our expense guidance that we would stay true to 5% to 7% and obviously this quarter we carved out the normalization of it. FX has had some help in that journey and some headwinds that we talked about earlier. So I can't really tell you a 46%, but I can tell you that we're 43.7% and that we're not retreating from continued margin expansion.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. 
Keith Housum: Question for you about the non-recurring revenue. If I looked at this quarter, I think, it was $5.7 million in non-recurring sales you have but in terms of what you recognize that this quarter's income statement was about $3.9 million. What's the trajectory of when that $5.7 million is recognized? Is it partly this quarter and perhaps the rest the following quarter?
Henry Fernandez: It has a whole host of constraints to go with it. That really depends upon when we actually deliver the product to our client. Now, sometimes, we can do data sales, history sales and that can be recognized within the quarter. Sometimes when we have long-term implementations where we have to really get a client hooked up and connected to Risk Manager that could take 12 -- part of the fees could be deferred until we're actually delivering the full product suite. So, it's hard to give you a good line of sight on that, because it really depends on the underlying sale and the product being delivered. It tends to be mainly driven though by the implementation deals or again volatility go back to second quarter of last year, we had a really high revenue recognition and a big chunk of we talked about was a lot of deals were completed for clients fully implemented, we're able to take the revenues. A more elongated sales plan, revenue recognition could be on the real estate side.
Keith Housum: [Indiscernible] next quarter or anything like that?
Bob Qutub: No, it's tough to give you guidance on that, because we do keep a pipeline, but some of these deals are contingent upon the client being able to deliver certain things to us as well as us delivering to them. So, it's a small amount.
Keith Housum: If I can cycle back to an earlier question regarding the reduction in the headcount and the efficiencies, I guess, is your thought process that the reduction in headcount has probably has hit its highest point [indiscernible] be adding personnel going forward?
Henry Fernandez: We don't target a headcount. We're looking at the positions. The positions that we took out, we took out. Those are efficiencies that we gain. Now, there is some turnover. There was a part of it, but you can see, the severance was $4 million for the quarter, we eliminated those positions. We do have other positions that are different, that are open that we will be selling through the course of the year that I talked about.
Keith Housum: Would we expect severance to be declining then for the rest of the year?
Henry Fernandez: Severance is tough for us to give you a number on that, but we expect to have it as a part of our continuing DNA as we continue to find efficiencies that are out there.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to MSCI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you all very much for your interest in MSCI and we will talk to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stephen C. Davidson - Managing Director & Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Abigail. Good day and welcome to the MSCI first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter 2015. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we have prepared for you for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. For the earnings presentation today, we have tried to make the information more additive to avoid repeating information that can be found in our release. So, we are happy to take your feedback on this different approach. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which may speak as of the date on which they are made. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. During today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses and adjusted EPS. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our core performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 29 to 32 of the earnings presentation. On the call today are Henry Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Qutub, Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to share with you today our first quarter 2015 results. For the quarter, we continue to execute our growth strategy. We deliver solid financial performance and the benefits of the enhanced investment program continue to build. In the slides today, we have provided you with new naming conventions for our product lines. Performance consists of our index, real estate and ESG products. Analytics consists of our risk management and portfolio management analytics products. First, let's talk about our financial performance. We generated 10% growth in operating revenues, driven by 13% growth in Performance subscription revenues. We recorded positive operating leverage in the quarter in advance of our second half 2015 commitment. And we expect to deliver continued margin expansion throughout the remainder of this year. We achieved 9% growth in subscription run rate, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. And we continued to achieve exceptionally strong retention rates across all of our product lines. Next, we'll talk about the enhanced investment program. For the call today, we will be highlighting how our investments have helped us position MSCI as a leading index provider to the ETF market and a leader in factor indexes and analytics. And how our investment are driving growth in our index and ESG products. Lastly, I will highlight how our investments have driven higher retention rates for the analytics product line, the steps that we have taken to reorganize analytics and why we feel this product line can return to higher growth, particularly exemplified by the client wins that we recorded in the quarter. On slide four, we show a set of KPIs that we believe are leading indicators of growth. The first section of this slide highlight the drivers of higher subscription revenue growth over time. Policy benchmark wins from asset owners, were up 7% year-over-year. And new index families launched were up 300%. Growth in ESG has been driven by growth in clients who increased about 35% reflecting the contributions of GMI as well. In the next section of the slide, we highlight the drivers of increased asset flows, which lead to higher asset-based fees. The number of MSCI-linked ETFs launched during the quarter increased 81% year-over-year. Active and passive assets tied to factor indexes of MSCI increased 29%. Period-end AUM linked to our indexes amounted to a total of $418 billion, up 23%. And since the end of the first quarter, ETF AUM linked to our indexes have continued to grow reaching $451 billion as of yesterday, and representing a further 8% growth since the end of the quarter. And lastly, listed futures and options trading volumes based on MSCI indexes increased 23% to 10 million contracts. The whole area of derivative products associated with our indexes is a major focus of our strategy and investment as well. Lastly, we highlight the driver of higher portfolio management analytics revenue. Run rate from new risk models that we have invested in and introduced over the past several quarters stand at $23 million, up 64% from $14 million in the first quarter of 2014, and up from $20 million or so at the end of 2014. The strong year-over-year increases across all these KPIs reflect the growth that we are seeing across the company. Slide five highlights the strength of our competitive position as a leading equity index provider to the exchange traded fund market. The global equity ETF industry is to add $2.3 trillion in AUM at the end of the quarter of which a record $418 billion was linked to MSCI indexes. Net new assets have flown primarily to European, Japanese and other non-U.S. developed market equities during 2015 with U.S. equities experiencing net outflows, reversing the trend that we saw at the end of 2014. And therefore, MSCI has been a major beneficiary of that trend. We rank number one in net new assets in equity ETFs globally in the quarter, a total of $53 billion of net new assets flow into equity ETFs globally in the quarter, of which a record $32 billion or about 60% went to ETFs based on MSCI indexes. As the U.S. dollar soared against other currencies in the quarter, currency-hedged ETFs have seen $28 billion in net new assets, with nearly half of those assets going to MSCI-linked ETFs. In just three months, global ETF assets linked to MSCI currency-hedged indexes have increased by 94% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, going from $16 billion to $31 billion, largely due to positive flows into MSCI currency-hedged index-linked ETF from Deutsche X-trackers, UBS, iShares and others. Additionally, there are now 68 currency-hedged ETFs globally linked to MSCI indexes, more than all other index providers combined. Therefore, we are poised to continue to benefit from the volatility of currencies and the U.S. dollar in the months to come. Globally, there were over 700 equity ETFs based on MSCI indexes as of the end of Q1, more than any other index provider. In the first quarter also, three ETF sponsors launched their first MSCI index linked exchange credit fund, and therefore continuing to expand the relationships that we have with various ETF managers. If we turn to slide six, here we provide a bridge of our new record ETF AUM linked to our indexes, a record that continues to grow, as I said, since the end of Q1 due to record inflows that we're seeing. In the top half of the slide, of the total $137 billion of cash inflows since 2012, a net $32 billion or 23% of these inflows are from new funds that were launched in the last two years. This is a direct result of the investment that we have made in launching new index families, which I referred to before to the first quarter, and in marketing to ETF managers around the world. In the bottom half of this slide, we have broken out for you the three primary buckets of what we call ABF revenue. In addition to the fees that we earn on ETF AUM, we also earned fees on our client institutional passive investment products, which amounted to $11 million in quarterly revenue. We also earned $2 million from exchange traded futures and options contracts that are based on our indexes. In addition to these volume-based revenues on exchange traded futures and options contracts, we also generate another meaningful amount of revenue in subscription fees related to broker dealers, licensing our products for over-the-counter equity derivative contacts. That part of the revenue is in the subscription revenue area.
Unverified Participant: (12:20) model.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: If we turn to slide 7, here we showcase our factor indexes, also known in the industry as smart beta indexes which are a key driver of our future growth. We have invested considerably in our factor indexes over the last year or two by bringing together our extensive equity index and equity risk model research capabilities and combining them with our wealth of data of over 40 years of Barra Factor data history. This unparalleled expertise is what differentiates us in our factor offering from our competitors. As a result, we have developed one of the leading factor index and factor risk model franchises in the world. Asset owners really get the best of both worlds as shown on the left side of the slide. They get the advantages of active management where they have the opportunity to outperform the market over long periods of time due to these factor indexes. And that is combined with the advantages of indexation or index investing where you have transparency and lower costs. This has resulted in a strong growth in factor-related AUM for us as shown in the upper-right chart. Active and passive AUM benchmark to MSCI Factor indexes grew 29% year-over-year. Included in these numbers is ETF AUM, and institutional passive AUM, and AUM related to clients who pay us subscription fees for data. This latter category is not required to report their AUM to us. So, there is an element of estimation of the AUM these customers have in their assets linked to our indexes. In the lower-right chart, we show the 67% year-over-year growth in the quarterly run rate related to factor indexes. We're also leveraging our research capabilities to assist ETF providers in launching new factor ETFs. Year-to-date, there have been 11 ETFs launched that track MSCI Factor indexes. And of the record $32 billion of net new assets going into MSCI-linked ETF in the first quarter, over $4 billion of that or 13%, flow into ETF tracking MSCI Factor indexes. Next on slide 8, we provide a snapshot of the index subscription product line. As you may remember, this is data that we sell to active managers for benchmarking purposes of their portfolio. On the left side of the slide, we show the growth progression in the index subscription product line, which has grown steadily over the past few years at around 10% compounded growth rate. This growth has been driven in part by the investment that we have made to innovate and develop new products to sell to our existing customers as well as the investments we have made in distribution and marketing to sell into new segment such as insurance companies. For example, one of the areas where we have seen significant growth in subscription revenues is in our thematic and custom indexes. And the run rate related to this product area has grown about 13% year-over-year. The steady growth of the index subscription product line has been complemented by a strong retention that we have achieved with a record 97% in the first quarter of 2015, as shown on the right-hand side of the slide. All of this is a good indicator of the health of this flagship index subscription product line for us. Moving to slide nine, we show the strong growth of the ESG product line as well as the benefits that our index products have received from ESG. As asset owners and asset managers around the world become more and more aware of the potential risks and the potential performance effects of environmental, social and governance factors, they are employing a range of ESG investment strategies and screens that are supported by MSCI's ESG offering. The chart on the upper left side shows the growth in run rate related to ESG indexes which is recorded in the index subscription line and not in ESG. This is another example of how we're leveraging product capabilities across MSCI. While we're still in the early stages in developing ESG indexes as shown by this lower dollar amount, we are very pleased with the trajectory of growth. ESG index clients grew 56% year-over-year and the run rate is up 50% to $1.3 million. And we expect that to continue as all these ESG factors are taken into account more and more in the global investment process. In terms of – when you look at the lower-left part of the slide, the chart there shows organic subscription run rate of 22% in ESG and about 46% growth including the GMI acquisition. So, this is clearly an area of fast growth for us, and we're very much focused on expanding it and investing in it. Slide 10, we highlight the new, reorganized analytics product line. As we announced in the fourth quarter earnings call, we have taken steps to reorganize and streamline the analytics' product line under the leadership of Peter Zangari, who has worked for the past three years to return the portfolio management analytics products to growth. And we're hoping that he and his team can help us do the same on the risk management analytics product line. This change was made because as I said in the past, our risk management analytics product line is not where it needs to be in terms of its level of growth and profitability. This is a product line that we believe strongly has very strong fundamentals, has strong growth potential and leverages a lot of the core strength and capabilities of MSCI, so we cannot tolerate low levels of growth or profitability at this time. The noncash charge that we took in the quarter was to stop a technology project that, while profitable, was not the right platform to take analytics to the higher level of performance. So, we're now moving in a new direction with a new technology platform that will serve as the basis for growth for the entire analytics product line and service lines. While we're still in the early stages of the reorganization, we are focused on moving analytics from a product-centric approach to a more use case focus approach based on client demand. We're focusing on what client problems we're solving for, then what services we line up against the client use case. By moving to this approach, we will be able to better leverage our core capabilities to deliver value-added solutions. This is what MSCI does best for its clients. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages in our analytics products. We offer established best-of-breed solutions, research analytical content that sits at the center of our value proposition, with an incomparable set of assets across indexes and multi-asset class analytics that – and we have deep experience computing the risk of very large, very complex trading portfolios. When we line this competitive advantage up against the key trends in the market, we feel very good about our positioning. We're seeing a growing focus by our clients of multi-asset class investing, and the tools necessary to understand performance and risk of those multi-asset class portfolios. Clients are looking for flexible and complete analytical tools. They're also looking for partnership with their providers in order to develop solutions that help them address their needs. And lastly, they're looking for quantitative tools that are becoming more and more standard and used widely as evident in some of the growth that we're talking about in factor investing. In short, we believe we have the right capabilities. The market is very large, and the competitive environment is stable, so there is no reason to tolerate lower levels of growth or profitability for this product line. We will keep updating you on the progress on this area and how we can return it to higher levels of performance. On slide 11, we show here a few – four examples of clients that we have won over the quarter in risk management analytics that we believe reflects the underlying strength of the value proposition. This win speak to the strength of our brand globally. They're also a validation that increase regulation. It's a driver of adoption of multi-asset class risk offerings. And overall, we also have a pipeline in our business that is strong with several large deal which slipped from the first quarter and have closed in the second quarter, and we hope to report that in the next call. With that, let me now pass it on to Bob. Thank you.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you. Thanks, Henry, and good morning to all of you on the phone. Please turn to slide 12 for a brief overview of our financial results. Our results this quarter were strong with 10% revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA expense growth of 8%, driving 11% growth in adjusted EBITDA, and a return to positive operating leverage which is well in advance of our second half 2015 commitment. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 67 basis points from the prior year quarter to 41%. Our net interest expense for the quarter now fully reflects the quarterly impact of our bond issuance in the fourth quarter 2014. The higher-than-expected tax rate was driven by an increase in operating profits in higher tax jurisdictions, but we continue to guide to an expected 35% to 36% effective tax rate for the full year 2015. Adjusted EPS was up 9% to $0.50 per share, benefiting from a 4% decline in the weighted average shares outstanding year-over-year and stronger operating results. The increase in share count compared to the fourth quarter reflects the impact of stock-based employee compensation in the first quarter. Before moving to the next slide, I wanted to comment on the impact of FX on our results. As we previously indicated, foreign currency fluctuations have been a headwind for our subscription revenues and run rate. The headwind had been mitigated by a significant portion of our expense base that is denominated in foreign currency. As a result, the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings was not material in the quarter compared to a year ago. This framework, however, does not reflect the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the underlying assets held in AUMs-linked to MCSI indexes which is the basis for asset-based fees. To a large extent, foreign currency fluctuations are reflected as part of market appreciation or depreciation along with other market factors. Now turning to slide 13, we provide you with a bridge for the year-over-year change in our revenues. Total revenues increased $23 million or 10% to $263 million. The growth was driven by an increase of $18 million or 9% in subscription revenues and an increase of $5 million or 12% in asset based fees. From a product perspective, the increase in subscription revenue year-over-year was principally driven by the performance product line, which increased $13 million or 13% driven by a strong growth in the equity index benchmark and ESG product-related revenues. Analytics revenue grew $5.4 million or 5%, driven by a 7% or $4.9 million increase in risk management analytics. As Henry made very clear earlier, we are not satisfied with the performance of the RMA product line, but we are not standing still. The actions that we're taking will take time, but we're confident of a positive outcome. Our real estate business has been particularly impacted by foreign currency fluctuations. Revenue increased 2% on a reported basis, but adjusted for a $2 million negative impact from currency fluctuations grew 19%. Real estate revenue in the quarter included the benefit of some early deliveries of client portfolio in our services reports, which normally would have been delivered in the second quarter. This is improving the efficiency of our platform, has been a focus of our investments which has allowed us to deliver client reports faster. The $5 million increase in asset-based fee revenue to $46 million was driven primarily by a $62 billion increase in average AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI indexes to $393 billion, as well as higher revenue from futures and options trading in contracts linked to MSCI indexes and revenues from institutional passive AUMs. In the first quarter 2015, cash inflows to the ETF market were a total of $53 billion, of which $32 billion or 60% flowed into ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, reversing the trend we saw at the end of the fourth quarter 2014, as flows then moved into the U.S. Of the $32 billion in inflows for the quarter, $13 billion was related to assets linked to currency hedged indexes with another $4 billion of inflows into factors. The reported average basis point fee for ETF AUMs linked to MSCI indexes was 3.38 at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from 3.39 recorded at the end of the fourth quarter 2014 driven primarily by mix shift. Now let's turn to slide 14 where we provide the adjusted EBITDA expense trends. The first quarter adjusted EBITDA expenses rose 8% to $155 million, as we continued to move more towards normalized levels of cost growth. The year-over-year increase was driven by a 13% increase in compensation expense, partially attributable to a 10% increase in head count, but also the compensation expense includes $2.9 million of the total $3.4 million non-cash charge we took in the quarter to terminate a technology project in analytics. Employees in emerging market centers increased to 51% in the first quarter 2015, up from 47% in the first quarter 2014, and in line with 51% reported in the fourth quarter 2014. The increase in compensation expenses was partially offset by a 3% decline in non-compensation expense, driven by general corporate efficiency efforts. Of the total $9 million growth shown on this chart, the $5 million was carryover on the 2014 spend. While the first quarter included a non-cash charge of seasonally higher payroll tax expense in the coming quarters, we expect to see higher cost bases on compensation-related inflationary increases, backfills of positions and other corporate costs. For the full year 2015, given some efficiencies that we have achieved on our expense base, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA expenses to come in solidly in the lower half of the previously announced range of $620 million to $640 million. Obviously, FX will continue to have some impact on the reported full year, but on a constant currency basis, we remain comfortable with this guidance. Turning to slide 15, we provide the run rate bridge for the quarter. Our reported run rate increased 8%, consisting of a 6% increase in the subscription run rate to $840 million, an 18% increase in ABF run rate to $191 million. Adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations, subscription run rate grew 9% year-over-year. In terms of subscription run rate growth, sales in the first quarter of 2015 amounted to a total of $29.5 million compared to $30.4 million in the prior year quarter. Performance of recurring sales increased 3%, negatively impacted by a 23% decline in real estate sales. The decline in real estate sales year-over-year was driven by timing and, to a certain extent, FX fluctuations. Analytics recurring sales declined 9% driven by a 19% decline in risk management analytics sales, partially offset by a 37% increase in portfolio management analytics sales. The first quarter in analytics of 2014 included very strong sales of InvestorForce and RiskManager products for the risk management analytics. And several deals in the first quarter 2015 rolled into the second quarter, some of which have already closed. Cancels amounted to a $12 million for the quarter, a decrease of 17% from the prior-year quarter, resulting in net new recurring sales of $18 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. The lower level of cancels drove year-over-year increases in retention across both products for performance and analytics product lines, resulting in aggregate retention of 94.4% with a record index subscription retention of 97.3%. FX fluctuations had a $25 million rolling four quarter negative impact on our subscription run rate. GMI acquired in August 2014 contributed $7 million to our run rate build year-over-year. Now, turning to ABF run rate. The $29 million increase was driven primarily by $77 billion period increase in ETF AUMs linked to MSCI indexes on inflows of $75 billion that I discussed earlier. Strong growth in institutional passive AUMs, as well as higher futures and options trade volumes in contract based on MSCI indexes also contributed to a year-over-year increase. Just to note, revenue recognition for trading volumes is on a one-month lag. A total of 10.1 million futures and options contracts on MSCI indexes were traded in the prior quarter, up 23% year-over-year, and open interest was a total of 1.1 million contracts. On March 16, aggregate volume with MSCI Index-based futures listed on ICE topped 395,000 contracts, a record trading day for MSCI-linked contracts. CBOE also recently launched options trading on our emerging markets and IPA indexes on April 21. Turning to slide 16, we provide our key balance sheet indicators. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $538 million, which includes cash held outside of the United States of $84 million. As a general policy, we prefer to maintain U.S. cash buffer of approximately $100 million to $125 million for operational purposes. Our gross leverage was 1.9 times based on total debt of $800 million to our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA within our stated guidelines of maintaining leverage at 1.5 times to 2.5 times. We generated strong operating cash flows of $67 million, up from $25 million in the prior year which were lower due to timing of account receivable collections. We continue to expect that we will generate between $275 million and $325 million in operating cash flows for 2015. We spent $6.3 million on capital expenditures in the quarter compared to $10.1 million in the prior year. The lower CapEx in the first quarter was due to timing and we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2015 capital expense range of $55 million to $65 million. Our board approved the second quarter dividend of $0.18 per share, which is payable on May 29. And lastly, as you know, we are in the market now with our current ASR, and we are committed to returning cash to our investors. Before we open the line to your questions on slide 17, I want to wrap up the call by providing a summary of key takeaways. In the first quarter, we continue to execute and we delivered solid financial performance. The benefits of our investments are taking hold, and we continue to see continued momentum in the coming quarters. In our core analytics product area, we have the right team in place, and we are taking the right steps to drive future growth and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the second quarter. And lastly, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. With that, I'd like to open the line to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
George Mihalos - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Henry and Bob, you guys – you did a nice job sort of segmenting the businesses going into a lot of detail. You mentioned several times you're not pleased with where the analytics business is presently. I'm just curious, as you think of your subscription run rate business on the index side, which is sort of – call it a low double-digit grower from a run rate perspective. Where do you ultimately think with the investments you've made that you can take the analytics business to relative to that growth rate in index?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Yeah, George. First of all, I think we have made tremendous progress in returning the equity analytics products to growth. If you see the growth in run rates there excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, we are in the 7% or so, 6%, 7% growth category. And it continues to feel good because we have launching a lot of new risk models that were selling well, as I mentioned. The Barra Portfolio Manager analytical application is complete and now really getting into strides for sales. And obviously, the negative overhang that we have is the ESG product line that is shrinking. And obviously, a large part of that shrinking is going to BPM, and we're trying to encourage customers to move there. So, that is a fairly good indicator of continued growth; all of that is a fairly good indicator of continued growth in the equity analytics line. And we expect that in the coming quarters and coming couple of years that that equity analytics growth rate and run rate will continue to increase. We have to see how far it goes, but we are pretty hopeful that will continue to increase through the high single digits and maybe at some point get to the low teens, right? So, I think on the risk analytics product line, we are clearly lower in run rate growth there when you exclude foreign exchange fluctuations. I think we're about, what, 5%, Bob, or something like that?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: 5% to 6%...
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: 5.5-or-so percent growth in the risk analytics product line, excluding foreign exchange fluctuations. And we're hoping that given the refocusing on the business, the streamlining of the teams that we're going to have a similar progression to what we did with equity analytics. First, getting it to the high-single digits and maybe eventually getting into the 10%, 11% range. But at this point, it's too early to tell when that will happen. Those are our expectations. And very importantly, also we're very focused on the cost structure of all of this. They're fairly profitable, but we like them to be even more profitable. So, we're focusing on combining functions, combining cost, combining technology, combining a lot of things so that we can expand the margins of this product line.
George Mihalos - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I appreciate that color. And then, just a point of clarification, you sounded a little bit more encouraged about your sales. Some of them may have slipped from the first quarter into 2Q. Should we be assuming that on the RMA side, you are likely to post a sales number in 2Q higher than the $10 million in Q1?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Hard to tell at this point. I will say that – the comment that we made was that that we had a couple of larger deals that just slipped by a few days, the end of the quarter and therefore, the carryover into the second quarter. We obviously have to continue to work the pipeline in the second quarter and if everything closes in the way we would like it to be there, it'd be a good quarter. But we may have again two or three larger deals at the end of the second quarter that slipped into the third quarter, and so on and so forth. So, I think importantly, the way to think about risk analytics right now is without the actions that we are taking, our sales are kind of trading in that range. And what we're trying to do by the actions that we want to take that we are taking is to try to break out of that range into a higher amount of sales. And we'll be able to update you more where we are on that by the next call. But your expectation should be that we're in that sort of narrow range of sales per quarter of the risk analytics and it could be plus or minus, which is fine, but what we're trying to do is break out of that range to a much higher number.
George Mihalos - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow-up on risk management analytics, can you just talk about the market environment there? Basically, are the challenges that you're seeing market-related as well as just company-specific? And when customers aren't using RiskManager, are they going to competitors or are they not using any products?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Yeah. So, Toni, the large majority of our clients, when they don't buy from somebody like us, they're not necessarily going to a competitor. It just means that the product or the functionality that they're looking for does not exist or doesn't exist in the way they wanted it, and therefore, they sit and wait, or they try to sort of patch things together internally in a sub-optimal fashion. So, now we want to continue to move forward the state-of-the-art in multi-asset class risk management and performance management analytics. And that's – because we believe that there is a fairly large feel here to help fulfill a lot of needs that people have to take a whole scientifically of their portfolios and understand on a more timely and more scientific basis what's happening with those portfolios, those total (44:16) portfolios and multi-asset class portfolios. I think the – going back to your first question, I attribute a meaningful part of our – when you look at it globally, a meaningful part of our slower growth to the fact that over the last two years or so, we have been really focused on upgrading the technology platform, including the data centers, making sure that our resilience was high, making sure we're complying with the increasing number of demands that people have about data security and Internet security and sort of cyber-attack security. Many of the diversified financial companies that have asset management subsidiaries are really wanting to see the vendors like ourselves, have airtight procedures in that. So, we've been working on putting all of that in place, and therefore, with the limited investment plan on this product line, we haven't been as aggressive in building a lot of new functionality, a lot of new products, a lot of new features and the likes of, largely but not totally. We're finding ourselves selling just an upgrade of what we have been selling a couple of years ago, and therefore, a meaningful part of the process here is to refocus the investment or the operating expenses if you want to call it of the business, streamline it, consolidate and the like, so we can free up some operating expenses to put into building more functionality, more capabilities and all of that which is going to be good to grow. That's what we did obviously on the equity analytics product line. We tightened up a lot of costs. We refocused efforts and refocused people and all of that, and we started launching our new models. We upgraded – we finished the upgrade on BPM and the completion of that and bingo, you start selling a lot more. So, it's not very complex. It's not very difficult. We've just got to tackle it and focus on it and get going because we believe that there is demand there. That's not to say that parts of the world are challenged. I mean, clearly, a lot of our asset managers in Continental Europe, for example, are going through difficult times because of the economy and the investment market there. And they maybe less expansive in investing, but we have a lot of clients in Asia, a lot of clients in the Americas and in other parts of the world that are waiting for us to give them better products and enhanced capabilities.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And just a quick one on the share of the flows. I think you mentioned a 60% share of global inflows this quarter. I think, last quarter the number that you gave was like a 40% ex-U.S. number. Are those comparable and also like very big increase? So, I just wanted to know any – your thoughts on the drivers behind the increase. Thanks.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Not comparable, Toni. This is Bob. We had significantly reduced inflows. We had positive inflows. Recall in the fourth quarter, a significant portion of inflows flowed into the U.S. You saw it in S&P and you saw in the first quarter a lot of it flowed out. Total flows in the ETFs were $53 billion. We captured $32 billion of it which is 60%. So, you can see some of the tone in there which was interesting, continued inflows into factors, which is $4 billion. But the interesting piece was we saw currency-hedged ETFs become popular in the first quarter given all the FX volatility. That's not necessarily a new product for us. That was something that we had in our tool kit and our investors were prepared to use and offer that to their clients and their investors. So, not comparable, back to your first question but...
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: The methodology is comparable.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Methodology.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Yeah. The methodology is comparable. It's just that the – where the money flows is different, right, Bob?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Correct. Yeah.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Yeah. So, I think in a nutshell, when – we're strongest around the world, developed markets, emerging markets and the like. So, when you see major flows of assets going to a lot of markets around the world, developed, emerging and the like, we benefit significantly. When you see a lot of flows going into the U.S., we do have a lot of U.S. products. So, we see inflows in those U.S. products. But relative to some of our own competitors and relative to the strength that we have around the world, you don't see as large amount of inflows. And the second part is that we're benefiting from factor indexes, obviously a lot of money going into there, as Bob indicated, and we're benefiting from the strong dollar, and people wanting investment products that are hedged against the dollar, right? So, that's what's happening, right? Now, look, this can reverse, right? If you see a huge amount of money flowing back to the U.S. at some point, we'll continue to get a major, a meaningful share of the flows because this is a category that is growing, but it may not be 60%, may be lower.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon or good morning. On the non-cash charge, Bob, I'm just curious to get some more details on exactly what the project was that you discontinued and what the new direction is that you're going in.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Chris. We were focusing in on working on bringing together our product lines in the risk management analytics area, and that has been going on internally. So, the accounting convention that is capitalizing internally developed software cost, $2.9 million of that was compensation, $0.5 million was non-compensation. As Henry pointed out, we reached to the point where, yes, we could still continue to achieve sales. It's probably better. There's a better way to look at the platform as we combined the analytics, so we made a decision that this was not the highest and best use of where we focused our attention, and now we're looking at a new platform going forward. So, again, it was an accounting charge, previously deferred costs that were related to an analytics technical project.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: But what is the difference between the old platform and the new platform? I hope you can be any more specific there.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Yeah. Let me try that, the challenge that we're facing at the company is that we have a few analytic application platforms that are – as a result of our own sort of growing and as a result of the acquisitions that we made, right. So, if you think about we have the RiskManager platform that came with the RiskMetrics acquisition and that supports a large number of use cases and significant amount of run rate. And then you have the BarraOne Technology platform that also has a lot of risk multi-asset class risk management capabilities, some fixed income portfolio management capabilities and some equity portfolio management capabilities and you have Barra Portfolio Manager platform which has a lot of equity portfolio management capabilities and is dealt on top of the BarraOne platform. So, what we're trying to do is in order to satisfy the convergence that clients have or need of having a much more integrated content and application that unites the risk management function, the equity portfolio management function and the fixed income portfolio management function into one consolidated approach. We've been taking – instead of trying to rebuild the whole thing which is not a good thing, we have been trying to come up with various technologies and programs to pull them together, as we think about it at the operational level, and then provide a much more integrated approach to the client. So, we went down this path, with this project, with technology that was good and tested, but it didn't do what we wanted it to do. So simultaneously with that, we had another approach to look at a different kind of technology that is probably newer and more innovative that could do it. And we are going with the second one, and therefore, stop doing the first one and discontinued it. And given that the accounting rules indicate that capitalize the time and effort in building that then we wrote it off.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: The one thing I want to add on that, Chris, is that in between here, we're still going through the research and development phase, so the deferred capitalizations are not occurring because we haven't reached that point. So as Henry pointed out, we're still going through the review process of it.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: But the goal is still the same, and I'm glad you asked this question, Chris, because the goal is still the same which is how do we take the existing operating system so to speak that we have built on the data libraries, the analytical libraries, and the computational abilities, the datacenters, and the like, and how do we glue them together and put them together with an overarching technology that connects them all, so that we can provide a much better integrated service to our clients that unites all these process in an efficient and fast way. And I think this new thing that we're looking at that is still in obviously developmental stage is very promising. But again, we'll have to report more on that in the future, right. So, there's a little bit of good news and bad news. The bad news is we wrote it off. The good news is that we find an alternative way that is better, and it holds more promise. And so, we're on that path right now.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for the detail, gentlemen. Just one more, Bob, on the guidance which I recognized on the adjusted EBITDA expense, it didn't change so it's $620 million to $640 million. How much growth does that imply I guess in dollars on a constant currency basis?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: There's really – the growth would be, as I related to, if you take the first quarter and analyze it, it's more inflationary-based related to compensation. We had a little bit higher turnover in the first quarter. We'll be backfilling some of that, and we've got some other charges out there that we see in the future coming through. But I would hesitate to call it growth other than normal business as usual, Chris.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, I mean, as I looked at it, Bob, I mean, at the midpoint of $630 million, it was I believe somewhere in the low $40 million range is what the year-over-year increase implies. But FX is maybe helping that number by, I'd like to call it, $15 million to $20 million. And then you also have the $15 million to $20 million that you called out last quarter of investment spend. So, kind of fair ex that investment spend and ex currency, you're in that low-$40 million sort of ballpark at the midpoint constant currency?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: I think the message is that constant currency, we're in the mid – we're looking now at the lower end of $620 million to $640 million, probably benchmarked somewhere at the lower half on a constant currency. Obviously, FX seems to be volatile. Look what's happened in this first quarter or the second quarter. Sterling has climbed back up, euro has climbed back up. So, that's why I said, the impact has been on FX given our exposure. Yes, it's been there, but that could be a reversal as we proceed through the year, which we focus on the constant currency. And again, a piece of that growth is really, I'd call it, growth that was carried over that I mentioned in the first quarter and that'll continue on a year-over-year basis that we've talked about last quarter.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with Keefe, Bruyette Woods. Your line is open.
Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Hi.
Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: So just thinking about – looks like you guys are getting more comfortable with your margin growth. Just curious, I mean, how quickly do you think you can get margins back up into kind of the mid-40 (57:39) ranges, and how dependent is that on the improvements from the analytics business?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: When we look at our forecasting, and as we take a look at it, we feel – I mean, our run rate is giving you a very good indication top line and what's happening out there, and we're managing our expenses to what we told you would be a midpoint. And as Henry pointed out, we're pulling for the timing of when our margin expansion would occur year-over-year in the first quarter. So we'll continue to see that steadily increase and we'll measure our costs going forward as we move forward, progress, and expanding the margin over the course of the year.
Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: But I guess in terms of thinking about your business lines, I guess, is the analytics – yeah, the analytics business enough of a headwind to slow that down or could you just actually grow the margin meaningfully enough through the performance line?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: No. I think – look, we look at this completely. We've had some very strong top-line performers, as Henry has pointed out. The index subscription which is core continues to show double-digit growth. The AUMs have been phenomenal on the ETF. Again, there could be a reversal of fortune out there, but then again, that's a significant piece of our revenue. Very promising top line growth on both ESG. And when you currency adjust the real estate, that continues to grow as well. Now, remember, that's the currency adjusted for real estate. Remember, there is exposure on the expenses so we get a benefit offsetting that as well. The PMA business grew significantly, when you think about it from that context, so it really is isolated to the RMA. And as Henry pointed out, the constant currency run rate was about 5.5%, so we're not all dependent on RMA. It does have a piece. If it does taper off, that does have some headwinds, but that's focusing in on the run rate on there. So, we still – look we haven't as of the end of the first quarter, we feel confident of continued margin expansion over the course of the year based on our analysis.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: And I'll also add that everything that I said about the better leverage and better profitability of analytics including RMA, is not factored in in all the communication that we have given you about margin expansion in the course of this year, right. So, if that were to happen faster, it will be better. But obviously it's hard to tell at this point, clearly how fast we can turn growth around to a faster level and higher profitability so that would be – if we do it and happens this year or next year that would be on top of what we're thinking in terms of margin expansion.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Henry's point, we're proactively managing our cost. We're constantly looking for efficiencies, we've demonstrated that in the first quarter. We will continue to demonstrate that and make tradeoffs going forward for the rest of the year with an eye on profitability.
Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. And then just on the CapEx side, I know you said there was some timing in it, it was a little bit lower, clearly lower than the sort of run rate would imply for the full year based on guidance. But just from a cash flow perspective, is there any sort of significant CapEx charge you're expecting in the coming quarters, or should we just think about it as sort of a $16 million per quarter rate through the end of the year?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: It's kind of chunky. I mean, Joel, I would look at it because as Henry talked to, you've got timing related to certain projects (61:09) so hesitant to make it a straight line. We're trying to give you a guidance on where we come in for the full year of $55 million to $65 million. For the full year obviously, it was a little bit lower in, so anticipated higher in the out quarters for the rest of the year.
Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. So, my first question is on smart beta factor indexes, how do you think that what MSCI offers in that arena is differentiated from your competitors? Is it mostly just a function of your underlying strengths, and then you just apply factor indices to those ETFs, or is there something in your methodology, in your mechanisms that differentiates you from the other index providers?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Well, I mean, through the equity analytics product line, we have been the leader in factor investing since 1975. So, when you think about the content that goes into the analytics product line, remember, there's a lot of content that then gets enabled by an application like BPM. So, the content is all about factor investing. It's about what are the factors that give you the sources of risk and return in an equity portfolio. So, the entire DNA of our equity analytics organization is about understanding market factors that are driving risk and return in portfolios. So, when you combine that expertise with the significant expertise that we have in building equity indexes, you end up with something that no other competitor in the marketplace has right now, which is a major expertise on understanding factors and understanding how factors drive portfolios and back-testing those portfolios, and so on and so forth.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. And then for my follow-up, I know it's only been a couple of months, but can you characterize the contributions that you've gotten from your three new board members?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Well, we've had, by now, two board meetings with them. And there was a fairly extensive onboarding process. Wendy Lane, which is one of our new directors, is sitting here in the room with us. So, welcome, Wendy, to the – to our first quarterly call here.
Wendy E. Lane - Independent Director: Thank you.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: And it has been a significant amount of contribution because they went through a rigorous onboarding process. They are looking at the business with fresh eyes, and that's always good, including people like me looking it for a long time. So, it's good to see people looking at it from a fresh perspective. And they are very, very good directors that are really eager to contribute to the success of the company. So, there's been a lot of discussion and debate about all of that. And importantly, because we are – in the next few months, we have our usual annual strategy discussion with the board in the summer, and they're very engaged in doing that with us and helping us sort of think through all the opportunities that we have ahead of us.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Keith Michael Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Thanks, guys, I appreciate the opportunity to ask questions. Looking at your employee count sequentially, it actually went down, I think, by 37 employees. Was this intentional decrease in the head count, or is this a factor of hirings and firings that go on in traditional day-to-day work?
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Well, remember, investments for us is largely, largely people, right? So when we say that we invested as much as we wanted to by now, now is more of a consolidation of that investment plan and (65:12) a lot of return out of that investment plan, and therefore, come back to more normalized levels of investment in the company and expense growth in the company. You're likely to see that tapering of the growth of head count. So since we have expanded quite a lot in the last 18 months, there was a meaningful deceleration in growth in the first quarter. It's not clear that that is what's going to continue for the next few quarters because it was one of those things in which we felt we had enough and we took a pause, but that's the rationale for it. But I will not read too much into it on the quarter-to-quarter change at this point, and we're not really managing to our head count, we're managing to an expense base, right?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: The first quarter's always got a higher turnover.
Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer & MD: Yeah.
Keith Michael Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Yeah, got you. Okay. Then for my follow-up if I may, yeah, the non-comp expense also came down, and I think you guys cited increased discipline. Was there any one-time items in there that perhaps would say that we shouldn't expect the same level of discipline for the rest of the year?
Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer: The only item – I mean, is obviously is going to be seasonality some of it. I mean, you can look at the non-cash charge of $500,000 that I referred to in my comments. If you recall, $3.4 million non-cash, $2.9 million of it was related to compensation. The other half was reversed in non-compensation. There's going to be some other seasonal charges in there. Obviously, CapEx was low. We can correlate some of the non-compensation costs to CapEx as we get equipment up and running and get licenses. So, there'd be some correlation there. But we're really effectively managing the cost on a discretionary basis as tight as we can – as well as we can with good corporate governance.
Keith Michael Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson for further remarks.
Stephen C. Davidson - Managing Director & Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for your interest in MSCI, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Stephen Davidson: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. A copy of that release may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You will also find on our website the slide presentations that we have prepared for you for this call. Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors on forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. For today's call, in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses and adjusted EPS. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our core performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures on Pages 30 to 32 of the investor presentation. On the call today with us are Henry Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Qutub, Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and I am pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Before I begin my prepared remarks, let me provide some comment about our new format. For the better part of last year, we have been listening intently to feedback and comments from many of you about what interests you and what concerns you about our company. Since our last earnings release, we have been hard at work in designing new slides, providing additional detailed information and a new script. I hope you like it, and please give us further feedback and comments to improve even more. Now let me move on to my script. I will begin with a strategic update, review the financial highlights and milestones for the year and provide you with a recap on the investment program. I will conclude by providing some additional context around the drivers of our margins over the past 8 quarters and our new guidance calling for margin expansion beginning in the second half of 2015. After Bob reviews the financial results, I will wrap up and we'll take your questions. Let me step back a bit and provide you with a strategic update that begins on Slide 3. In 2014, we delivered strong financial performance and significantly enhanced our business through the investments that we initiated in 2013 to drive our future growth. We are pleased with the progress of our enhanced investment program, which is now largely complete. The investments we made in products, sales and technology have driven near-term returns, principally in the form of much higher retention rates. We expect that these investments that we have made in product development and technology will deliver returns over the medium-term as well in the form of higher sales, higher run rate and higher revenue. We're now able to wind down our spending growth to more normalized levels, assess how things are working and focus on ensuring that our investors are rewarded for the patience they have shown as we have executed this program. To our defense, we're working to ensure that the investments we made in each initiative achieve the expected return, and any initiative that was not achieved, expected ROI will be modified or stopped. We also announced today internally at MSCI that we have reorganized the firm to put Baer Pettit in charge of all MSCI products; Laurent Seyer, who joined us in December, continues to head all client coverage; and Chris Corrado continues to head all technology and data services. And all 3 will continue to report to me. As part of this reorganization, we have combined PMA and RMA into one analytics product line under Peter Zangari, who has successfully restarted the growth engine for PMA over the last couple of years. Peter and his team will be focused on generating more revenue and increase operating efficiencies from our combined analytics product line. Based on the encouraging early returns on our investment and our continued focus on ensuring their benefits, we now expect margin expansion to begin in the second half of 2015 and continue thereafter. This is earlier than our previous guidance of margin expansion beginning in 2016, and is predicated on a stable operating environment going forward, especially in asset-based fees. Moving on to capital allocation. In the third quarter of 2014, we announced an enhanced capital return policy with a commitment to return $1 billion in capital to investors by the end of 2016. Over the past year, we have been very disciplined in our approach to M&A, and given that our focus is basically on organic growth and the return of capital to our investors, we are well positioned to continue to do so. I am pleased to report, therefore, that we returned $420 million to investors in 2014 through buybacks and dividends, and our board just declared our first quarter 2015 dividend. Finally, as part of our continued commitment to ensure that investors can accurately value our franchise, we are in the process of evaluating new ways to increase transparency in our financial reporting. We expect to introduce new reporting segments in the second half of 2015, and we will work to make sure that this process is as smooth as possible to the investment community. Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of full year 2014 results. We reported strong results across all metrics. MSCI's run rate grew 8% and adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange, our subscription run rate grew 9%. Revenues grew 9%, driven by strong increases in both recurring subscription and asset-based fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up only 1%, which reflects the effect of $37 million in investments and costs from GMI that flow through our P&L in 2014. Finally, our adjusted EPS grew by 6%, principally due to lower income tax expense and a lower share count. We also took a number of operational actions in 2014 to enhance our competitive position in the near and medium term. We completed the bolt-on acquisition of GMI, our complementary provider of ESG ratings and data and research. We significantly enhanced our internal capabilities by bringing in new market-leading talent in key functions, including a new Chief Human Resource Officer to help us foster and attract great talent and a new Head of Client Coverage to deepen our client relationships. As you know well, we divested ISS to focus our attention, resources and capital on our core capability. We made a commitment to do so in 2013 and we delivered on that commitment in 2014. In summary, 2014 was a very strong year for us. We significantly expanded our capabilities and we're now in a very strong position to take full advantage of the many growth opportunities that we believe lie before us. Let me now provide you with more details around our investment program. On Slide 5 are the benefits that we're seeing from our 2014 investment spend related to sales, client service and marketing. To drive sales and deepen our relationship with clients, we hired 109 net new sales and client service people in 2013 and an additional 44 people in 2014. The training cycle of our sales people varies by product area. Training a sales person in our equity index product line takes about 6 months, whereas a salesperson in risk management analytics might require 1 year or more. The hires that we made in 2013, therefore, had a negligible impact on our sales in 2013. But we are beginning to see their impact in the last year of 2014 with total sales of $37 million in the fourth quarter, the highest level since the first quarter of 2011 or almost 4 years ago. So subscription sales of $32 million in the quarter were the highest since the third quarter of 2010. Higher sales, combined with the lowest level of cancel of any fourth quarter ever resulted in our highest fourth quarter net new sales since the fourth quarter of 2008 or at the start of the financial crisis. This has therefore translated into an aggregate retention rate of 93% in 2014, an increase of 150 basis points over the previous year. So we are already seeing significant returns primarily in the form of higher retention and we're beginning to see the benefits of our sales hires with a stronger sales which we expect to translate into run rate and revenue growth over time. On Slide 6 is the adjusted EBITDA expense development from 2012 to 2014 or the 2-year period of enhanced investments. We are providing you with a detailed -- the details on this slide in response to the desire for more transparency around development in our expense base and detail around our enhanced investment program. Over this 2-year period, we recorded expense growth of $151 million beginning with a baseline in 2012 of $437 million. Let me break this down for you in the key components that make up this $151 million increase. First, moving from left to right, we have incremental organic growth in expenses of $36 million. This includes investments in our technology platform, in client service, retention, inflationary spend and onetime costs. This is normally what you will call business-as-usual incremental costs. These dollars help us acquire resources and capability, direct near-term returns, such as retention, sales and product enhancement. In the middle, you see the impact that acquisitions has had on our expense base principally from IPD, what we call real estate nowadays, the GMI acquisition and InvestorForce. In total, these acquisitions reflected in the first 12 months of expenses after closing were $71 million. These acquisitions, as we have reported in the past, were to fill gaps in our portfolio, expand our exposure to new asset classes and accelerate capabilities, all within a 3- to 5-year window that we set for acquisitions to be accretive in our financial results. On the right then, you'll see the enhanced investments of $44 million in 2013 and 2014. These investments were directed at new indices, new factor models, geographic expansion, data center expansion and to bring in our critical executive leadership to our firm. In summary, with our enhanced investments, we have acquired the resources to develop, build and sustain MSCI for growth. And to complete the bridge, we ended 2014 with adjusted EBITDA expenses of $588 million. Let us now turn to Slide 7, which shows the incremental growth in our revenues from this 2-year period of enhanced investment. We generated incremental revenue growth of $170 million. Again, moving from left to right, we generated $75 million in incremental organic revenue from the build out of our existing asset-based fee products and subscription product offering. Incremental revenues from our acquisitions of IPD, GMI and InvestorForce were approximately $59 million. This is initial revenue from these acquisitions, and we're surely focused on their growth and their return to levels of profitability. We expect these acquisitions to be accretive in the 3- to 5-year timeframe that we discussed before and we are well on our way to achieve that. For example, IPD, which represents a considerable part of the $71 million in incremental adjusted EBITDA expenses recorded 9% year-over-year revenue growth and run rate growth of 12%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange while a lot of the revenues and the run rate of IPD is in pounds and in euros. We earn $24 million in incremental revenue from the investments we have made in the asset-based fee product line, principally the ETF product line. From the end of 2012 through the beginning of 2014, our asset-based fee revenue grew from $140 million to $177 million, a $37 million increase. This is above the $22 million negative impact from the net loss revenue on EBITDA from the transition of Vanguard. So our total growth in ABF was, in effect, $58 million in this 2-year period, reflecting our tremendous performance on winning back significantly more than the revenue we lost at the time of the Vanguard transition. This $58 million in growth was split between $24 million from our recent investment and $34 million from what we call organic asset based fee growth, which is a combination of inflows and market appreciation of existing older products. Let me touch on a few statistics that reflect the very strong results on our ETF franchise. 43% of the inflows into our ETFs were in products that we have developed over the past 2 years. We saw a surge in demand from ETF providers for MSCI factor indices, with almost half of new MSCI-based ETFs launched in 2014 linked to this MSCI factor indices that we have inherent at work. Lastly, we have the incremental revenue of $34 million from the investment that we made in our subscription business. That is towards the right of the chart. The incremental revenue was driven by increased retention rates, the 24 new index families we launched in 2014, enhanced capability in Barra Portfolio Manager and the new slew of risk models that we have launched in the past year or 2. Turning over to Slide 8. We show a set of KPIs that we believe are leading indicators of growth for the investment that we have made in product development and technology. As you can see, our investments have enabled us to increase our production of new indices, specialty factor indices and custom indices, we have deepened our relationships with ETF providers and developed relationships with new ones, we have produced quite a number of new risk models and we have build out data center capabilities to process more portfolios and provide better service in our multi-asset class platform. In the equity investment process as a whole, policy benchmark wins in 2014 were 182, up 8% from the prior year. New index families have seen a 243% increase in the past year compared to 2013. The number of new ETF linked to MSCI indices grew 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 22% of the total number of ETFs launched globally by all index providers and ETF managers in 2014. Active and passive assets tied to our factor indices continue to increase more than 60-plus percent to $122 billion in 2014, a key metric given our leading position in factor indices. Given market volatility at the end of the fourth quarter, I want to provide you with more detail on ETF linked to MSCI indices. First, U.S.-listed ETFs. In Q4, U.S. equity ETFs in general altogether for all index providers, captures 76% of cash flows which reduced MSCI's market share of cash flows during the quarter. Despite that trend, we continue to see successful ETF launches based on our indices in Q4. Two of the largest launches in 2014 were based on the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index. We also continue to see growth in our client base. We've developed the ETFs based on MSCI indices exceeding $2 billion in AUM and Deutsche Bank ETFs based on MSCI indices exceeding $3 billion in AUM. Turning to Europe. While the focus on U.S. equity has reduced MSCI's market share of cash flow for the quarter, Europe had a record-breaking inflows of $44 billion into European domicile equity ETFs, on which MSCI took $17 billion or 39%. MSCI increased its AUM market share to 35% of inflows in Europe from 33% the prior year. Stepping back and looking at full year 2014 on a global basis, we saw a surge in demand from ETF providers for MSCI factor indices, with almost half of new MSCI-based ETFs launched in 2014 linked to MSCI factor indices. 42 of MSCI factor index ETFs were launched in 2014 compared to 6 only the prior year. 95 ETFs based on MSCI indices were launching in 2014, almost twice as many as the next index provider. And amongst all index providers, MSCI has the highest market share of AUM from new ETF launched during the year. MSCI's idea of market share increased in 2014 with our share of cash flows from 2014 being higher than our market share of AUM on the year prior to that. Quite a great deal of the leading franchise that we have in MSCI factor indices is a result of the combination of capabilities and skill set from our Barra product line and our MSCI index product line. In our Equity Index analytics product line, we have been very pleased not only with the pace new model generation but also with the way in which MSCI's research capabilities produced models that are strongly differentiated from what our competitors are offering. We launched 25 new risk models in the 2-year period of '13 and '14. Now that we have essentially caught up with the launch of new risk models, we expect to launch about 12 of these models in 2015. We're tracking the revenue that we generate from these new models, and I am pleased to say that we had $20 million in 2014 from these new models that we created, a 57% increase over 2013. Finally, in the multi-asset class investment process, we processed a total of 31 billion securities in 2014, most of which was in risk management analytics. Just a couple of years ago, the technology and processing capability of the RMA product line had reached its limit and was in need of significant upgrade. As a result, over the last 2 years, our investment in the RMA product line has been focused on upgrading our processing and our technology capabilities. If we had not focused the spend on our technology platform, we would not have maintained the relatively stable growth that we have seen in the run rate for this business and the high retention rate that we have achieved. We have the confidence that our platform and processing capabilities are robust, our new client numbers are growing, and we're well positioned to reap the rewards of our investment in this area. Let me conclude my section on Slide 9. We saw the trend -- where we saw the trend in our adjusted EBITDA margin beginning in the first quarter of 2013, again, the 2-year time period that we've been engaged in an enhanced investment program. The decline in our EBITDA margin from 45% in the first quarter of 2013 to the low of 40% in the first quarter of 2014 was driven by 2 factors that we undertook to create value for our shareholders over the near and medium term. The first is the impact of acquisitions. In November of 2012, we acquired IPD, the real estate performance measurement and performance attribution service group. In January 2013, we acquired InvestorForce, our performance reporting for consultants. Finally, in August of 2014, we acquired GMI Ratings, the pioneer in the application of nontraditional risk factors to investment analysis and risk modeling. We are on track with each of these acquisitions to achieve our stated goal of delivering returns above our cost of capital within the first 3 to 5 years. But until we achieve those returns, they are a drag on our margin. If you aggregate them together when you look at the slide, you see that we're operating them at a slight EBITDA loss. Real estate, for example, as you can see in our supplemental disclosures in the appendix, generated $50 million in revenue from the real estate quota [ph] carrier. So as these acquisition move to increase profitability, we expect each to generate a more meaningful contribution to EBITDA and to earnings. The second factor in the decline of our margin is the investment program, which we began 18 months ago. Our margin decline includes a loss of $19 million in revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2013 from the Vanguard model. We have since regained more revenue than we lost higher levels of profitability, as I noted before. Based on the near-term return and the emerging medium-term returns that we are looking for, we're now expecting to achieve margin expansion in the second half of 2015 and we expect progressively higher margin to follow thereafter as we achieve the payback on these investment. Again, all of this is predicated on a stable operating environment, especially in asset-based fees. We will not be able to achieve this without developing broader product relationship with our clients. Roughly 65% of our top 100 clients use products from the entire MSCI product line. This is not a small slice of our business. These clients represent 43% of our subscription run rate. Since we began our investment program, the revenues from these clients is growing at a rate of about 9%, well above our growth in revenues of 7%. This is why we're building a model that enables us to deliver our full suite of products and services to our entire client base. Doing business with our client this way results in significantly higher revenues and we're only at the start of capitalizing on that cross-selling opportunity. Let me now turn over to Bob for the financial results.
Robert Qutub: Thanks, Henry, and good morning to all of you on the phone this morning. Let's get right into the numbers on Slide 10. Our performance across our key metrics in the fourth quarter was strong. Run rate and revenues were up 8% and 6%, respectively, versus the prior year with subscription run rate of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX. Adjusted EBITDA was up 4% to $104 million. Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $0.49, benefiting from a lower tax rate in the current quarter and a 5.5% decline in the weighted average shares outstanding year-over-year. On Slide 11, we provide you with a bridge for the year-over-year change in our revenues. Total revenues rose $14 million or 6% to $251 million. The growth was driven by an increase of $8 million or 4% in subscription revenues and an increase of $6 million or 16% in asset-based fees. Over the past several quarters, we have seen significant fluctuations in the currency markets. The FX impact manifests itself in several ways into our financial statement but overall, the net effect to our income statement has not been significant. Approximately 15% of our revenues are billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. A much larger percentage of our operating expenses, approximately 45%, are incurred in foreign currency because of the large global footprint of our firm. Turning to Slide 12, we provide the adjusted EBITDA expenses trend. While our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA expense rose 8% to $147 million, this is the second consecutive quarter in which the year-over-year growth has declined from the 21% we recorded in the second quarter of 2014. It should be noted that the quarter also includes $2 million in professional fees related to our recent shareholder matters. Adjusted EBITDA expenses increased $80 million or 16% full year 2014 compared to the prior year. Consistent with our guidance on Investor Day, in March last year, let me highlight some of the major drivers of the increase. $46 million of the increase or 58% has gone towards product development and technology and this also includes our investment in GMI. Sales, client service and marketing accounted for $22 million or 27% of the new spend. These investments have had a more immediate impact, helping us lift our overall level of sale to the highest level since the first quarter of 2011 and these investments are contributing to the increase and maintenance of our very strong retention rates. At $588 million in adjusted EBITDA expense, we came in below our adjusted full year guidance of $595 million to $605 million. Turning to Slide 13, we provide you with the adjusted EBITDA expense bridge to show you the drivers of the year-over-year increase. We ended 2013 with $500 million of adjusted EBITDA expense. The increase of $80 million or 16% can be broken down broadly as follows: $43 million spent on our enhanced investment program, including $6 million related to GMI, the remainder reflect increases associated with running our business as well as higher advisory and other fees. Excluding the $43 million spent on investments in GMI, adjusted EBITDA expenses were up just over 7% in 2014. Turning to Slide 14. We provide you with more detail regarding the $43 million in investments we made in 2014. As you can see, the investments made have been broad-based across all of MSCI, directed at developing new products, expanding capabilities and improving client service. We estimate these investments have resulted directly or indirectly in additional revenues of approximately $57 million in 2014 and will be the basis for driving long-term shareholder value creation. Turning to Slide 15. We have a summary of the fourth quarter operating metrics. Total run rate grew by $72 million or 8% to just over $1 billion, driven by a $55 million increase or 7% increase in subscription run rate and a $17 million or 10% increase in asset-based fee run rate. The 7% increase in our subscription run rate to $832 million, which includes the impact of FX rate, was driven by a 12% increase in index, real estate and ESG subscriptions and a 3% and 4% growth in run rate for RMA and PMA, respectively. Turning to our sales metrics. Total sales rose by 5% to $37 million, the highest quarterly sales number we have recorded since the first quarter of 2011, as Henry pointed out. In Q4, we had $17 million in annualized cancellations, the lowest Q4 level for cancellations since 2008, reflecting the continued benefit we are seeing from our investments in client service and our consultants. The combination of higher sales and lower cancellations resulted in net new recurring subscription sales of $15 million, the highest Q4 level since 2008. This resulted in MSCI's aggregate retention rates increasing across all products, both year-over-year and the full year 2014 with aggregate retention rates of over -- of 91% for the fourth quarter and 93% for the full year 2014, the highest fourth quarter retention rate since our IPO. On Slide 16, we'll drill into our run rate to show the impact of FX and acquisitions. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, FX had a significant negative impact on our subscription run rate in the fourth quarter, especially on our analytics product line. Total changes in FX lowered our subscription run rate by $15 million year-over-year. Excluding the impact in FX and the acquisition of GMI, which contributed $7.4 million to our run rate, total subscription run rate grew by 8%. Since the first quarter of 2013, our organic subscription run rate X FX -- excluding foreign exchange, has increased from growth rates of 4% in the first quarter of '13 to 8% in the current fourth quarter. Now let's turn to the Slide 17, where I'll begin my review of the performance of our 3 major product lines. Index, real estate and ESG subscription revenues grew 7% to $100 million. On an organic basis, subscription revenues grew by 5%, excluding GMI. Now drilling into the components. The index revenues increased 8% to $84 million, real estate subscription revenues declined $2 million or 24% to $8 million from the prior year, due in part to timing of product deliveries and revenue recognition. Total ESG revenues increased 50% to $9 million or 16%, excluding the impact of GMI. Total index real estate and ESG subscription run rate grew by 12% to $414 million. The index run rate grew 10% to $335 million with negligible FX impact. Real estate subscription run rate increased 3% to $45 million, but adjusting for the impact of FX, the run rate increased 12%. The run rate for the Americas showed particular strength in real estate increasing to $5 million or 25%. The ESG run rate of $34 million represented an increase of 51%, but on an organic basis, excluding the impact of FX and ESG, run rate grew 22%. The retention rate for index, real estate and ESG increased to 93% and was 94% for the full year of 2014. Now please turn to the index asset-based product discussion on Slide 18. ABF revenues grew 16% to $45 million in the quarter driven by strong inflows into ETFs and non-ETFs asset funds. Run rate grew by $16 million or 10% driven by a 12% increase in assets under management linked to MSCI indices which was the $373 billion as of December 31. Looking at the fourth quarter 2014 in isolation, we entered the period with AUMs of $377 billion. There were $4 billion of cash inflows and market depreciation of $8 billion for a net decline of $4 billion. This was driven by a spike in volatility at the end of the year resulting in period ending AUMs of $373 billion. On a full year basis, we saw $49 billion of net inflows offset by lower market performance of $9 billion and excluding the effect of Vanguard in 2013, this is approximately 7% higher than it was in the prior year. On Slide 19, we have the key indicators of our risk management analytics product area. Revenues grew by just over 1% year-over-year and run rate rose by 3% to $310 million. Excluding the impact of FX, run rate rose by 5%. The aggregate retention rate rose to 89% for the quarter versus 86% in the prior year and was 91% year-to-date. Sales rose 9% versus fourth quarter 2013. And as Henry mentioned earlier, we have invested in building and expanding our capacity which has created a better environment to meet the needs of our client, and this has resulted in improved retention. On Slide 20, we have the key indicators in the portfolio management analytics area. Revenues were relatively flat to the prior quarter. Run rate increased 4% and by 6%, excluding the impact of FX. The growth in run rate continues to be driven by both stronger sales which rose 63%, and by a much stronger aggregate retention which increased to 93% from 89% a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, aggregate retention rates rose significantly to 93% from 87%. The growth rate in sales of portfolio management analytics was driven by higher sales of equity models and Barra Portfolio Manager. The return to growth is directly attributable to the investments we have made in this product area. Now turning to Slide 21. Let me give you a quick snapshot of our profitability metrics. We reported EBITDA of $104 million for the quarter, which represented an increase of 4% year-over-year; adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.5%, declined from 42.4% in the prior year quarter but increasing sequentially from 40.5% in the third quarter 2014. The fourth quarter 2014 effective tax rate of 38.8% was higher relative to the full year 2014 guidance of approximately 36%, reflecting a negative impact of certain discrete items in the quarter partially offset by the reenactment of the research and development credit. On Slide 22, we're incorporating more metrics for our fixed income investors. We ended 2014 with cash and cash equivalents of $509 million, which includes cash held outside of the United States of $102 million. And as a general policy, we prefer to maintain U.S. cash buffer of approximately $100 million to $125 million for operational purposes. Our gross leverage was 2x based on our total debt of $800 million to our 2014 adjusted EBITDA, well within our stated policy of maintaining leverage of 1.5 to 2.5x. We generated strong operating cash flows of $305.7 million for the full year within the guidance and right about the midpoint of the range we provided for the year. We spent $51 million in CapEx for the full year 2014 ending the year at the low end of our guidance range we provided for the year. In 2014, we repurchased 6.9 million shares as part of the 2 ASRs bringing the weighted average diluted shares outstanding to 113 million shares for the quarter, and shares outstanding at the end of the period were $112.1 million. As a reminder, our current ASR is scheduled to mature between early March and mid May. Lastly, as a quick refresher on our commitment to return $1 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016, we executed the most recent $300 million ASR in September under the plan and we paid our first quarterly dividend in October. Further, our board approved our first quarter 2015 dividend to be payable on March 13, 2015. We currently have $550 million remaining on the outstanding share repurchase authorization from our board, and as we move forward, we'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of executing repurchases to ensure that we have -- we optimize the method by which we return capital to our shareholders. And before tuning the call back over to Henry for his closing comments, we provided you with a full year 2015 guidance on Slide 23. We expect adjusted EBITDA expense to be in the range of $620 million to $640 million. Incremental is driven by several components. First, a full year effect of the investments we have made in 2014 will be the principal driver of the increase of approximately $15 million to $20 million when you annualize them into 2016 [ph]. Next, we'll have moderate inflationary costs for compensation and noncompensation and this will include incremental technology, costs related to continued capacity, though in a small magnitude. We're expecting margin expansion to begin in the second half of 2015 and continue thereafter. Due to the seasonal first quarter effect on compensation increases, payroll taxes and benefits, we expect that our margins will be impacted slightly from the Q4 levels and then by the second half of 2015, return to the approximate Q4 '14 exit rate of $41.5 million and from there, we expect margin expansion to begin and continue in the subsequent quarters. We expect our cash flow from operations to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million and capital expenditures are projected to be $55 million to $65 million. And finally, we anticipate that our full year tax rate will be approximately 35% to 36%. And lastly, our indicative payout ratio remains at 30% to 40% of adjusted EPS. With that, let me turn it over to Henry for some closing comments.
Henry A. Fernandez: So before I open the line to questions, I would like to welcome our 3 new prospective board members, Wayne Edmonds; Rob Hale; and Wendy Lane. We very much look forward to benefiting from their experience and perspective when they join our board in March. I realize we gave you quite a great deal of information and detail. It has compressed a bit the Q&A period. We'll take some questions now but in the event we run out of time, we'll be more than happy to take your questions after the call in the next day or 2 as well. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Georgios Mihalos with Crédit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Henry and Bob, just sort of 2 quick things here. One, just maybe talk a little bit about what will drive the $620 million or $640 million, that $20 million of delta in your expense looking out into '15? And then somewhat related to that, on the prior quarters, Henry, you spoke about revenue growth in '16 sort of correlating with EBITDA growth sort of in the double-digit range. Is the new sort of formula for MSCI -- are you more comfortable looking at the business as sort of a sustainable high-single-digit top line grower with double-digit EBITDA growth for margin expansion and then adding onto that incremental points from buyback and dividend?
Henry A. Fernandez: Let me address the second question, George, and then Bob will take on the first one. Yes, so this -- what we did in the last quarter or so was -- we just going -- we always do this at the end of the year when we are preparing our budgetary process -- we're going through our budgetary process for the following couple of years. We really took stock on where we were with all of our capabilities, all the investments that we have made, all the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, we discussed it with our board and clearly, one of the key functions of a board and a management team is to size up the company to the appropriate opportunity. So we felt that we had already completed a big part or the major part of what we set out to achieve a couple of years ago, and it was earlier than expected when we took this deep dive. So to that now changes the guidance that we gave you with respect to EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA expense growth and revenue growth in terms of the link between the 2 that you mentioned. We are still very much of the view that our business will achieve sort of double-digit growth as we discussed before. The only change we made is clearly the rate of growth of our expenses and the timing being reduced -- rate of growth of the expenses being reduced sooner rather than later at this point.
Robert Qutub: And George, on your second question, it's really 2 parts, one is the annualization of the hires and we hired people, mid-year obviously, in the second and third quarter as part of these initiatives. It's just the continuation of the annualization of the compensation, and the other piece would be the annualization of the cost related to GMI.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And just last question. The retention rates look great, they continue to improve well ahead of what we were looking for. You commented on the new sales improving as well, but if we sort of look at them, at least the recurring sales, over the back half of '14 versus the back half of '13, they're sort of flattish there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the environment and kind of your thoughts on driving those higher?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. So the area, we clearly -- in terms of our investment plan, 2, 3 areas that we're clearly, clearly the most proud of is the enormous increase in retention rates, right? Way and above our highest expectations. We set out to put an enormous amount of servicing around on our existing client, so that has paid in spades and clearly, also, our ABS business and our ETF had paid in spade and the PMA business and others, right? The one area across the company that is lagging naturally is the sales in terms of payback of the investment. That is normal because we added a lot of salespeople, obviously, and those take time, as I mentioned in my script, take only the product development that we're going, take time and running through the system and being launched. And then when you launch them, it takes time to obviously accumulate sales. And then three, we're not completely in a normal operating environment. By normal, I mean pre-'08, and there is a little bit of an impact there. But we're still hopeful that we'll see a continued grinding upward of the pace of sales and as we get the payback from all the things that I mentioned.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Really like the new format. First question, just on the RMA and PMA and just want to get a little bit more detail on the rationale for combining those. And from a client's perspective, what that will look like. And then kind of in relation to that, one of your shareholders had made a comment about the One MSCI strategy and criticizing that and maybe you could talk about what's worked and what changes you've been making and you're thinking there?
Henry A. Fernandez: I'm glad you liked the new format. So we clearly want to do it more in the coming quarters, Chris. So I think the -- there are a couple of ways to address that question, Chris. The first one is that there is a significant amount of convergence going on between our equity index product line and our equity analytics product line because the vast majority of the new product development effort and the new activity in this business is factor indices. So the equity analytics business is about building factor models, right, that discern the factors that are affected, return and risk of portfolios and, therefore, we're taking all of that know-how experience, people and all of that and combining it with our equity index capability to arrive at a leadership position in factor indices and factor investing that I mentioned before. The second convergence that is happening, which is the one that you're alluding to is the convergence between front office, analytical capabilities, so just equity portfolio management capabilities, and that's part and parcel of the equity analytics product line, and risk management central of the risk management analytics sort of capabilities. So what we're trying to do is we clearly are announcing the combination of what we call -- we used to call PMA and RMA in order to capture that convergence and generate higher revenues, higher sales and all of that but also better efficiencies in how they work together. What we didn't combine, because it's already working really well, is the equity analytics research team working very closely with the equity index research team in building all these great factor indices that we're doing. So that's what we're trying to achieve there. With respect to the -- and that's what clients want us to do. They -- we constantly get our clients saying, can I have one person that can help me look at the entire product line that you have, and bring all of that capability to bear to my initiatives, my objectives, what I'm trying to drive in my firm. So we're clearly pushing that pretty strongly on the client end with the senior relationship managers and the like. With respect to comments about the One MSCI, I think there is a little bit of a misinterpretation. This approach of trying to put all of our capabilities in front of our clients is not at all in order to subsidize one product against the other one or to reduce the prices of any one single product. If you check around MSCI, definitely not well known for giving too many breaks, right, including some of your organizations. This is an attempt to service our client better, create better -- it can create better impact on them and therefore generate incremental revenues from them because we're serving them better and solving problems better for them.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Maybe just to follow up on some of the -- the question that you just heard in terms of some of the public investor commentary you received so far this year. Just, obviously, you reacted and we saw some of the board changes here. But just curious to what degree increased discussions and public commentary has impacted some of the views on expenses going forward, some of the investment spend. Clearly, there's been a little bit of a change here. So curious how that's been impacted. And bigger picture-wise, if it's also impacting the way you think about acquisition strategy, divestitures, capital return, anything you want to share.
Henry A. Fernandez: So the -- only way you know are in terms of the dialogue with those shareholders starting August of last year and running through January, first a private phase and then obviously a public phase or semipublic phase of that in the last 5 weeks. A lot of the dialogue has been more of strengthening the board and adding people to the board and who the right people should be in that. There's clearly been a dialogue with them and every other shareholder that has been -- and this is a response of that of where is the investment going? How do we provide better clarity of that, better metrics, better representation and the like, and we have been hearing that from quite a lot of our shareholders and from many of you in the analyst community. So we have been working on that for quite some time in terms of trying to provide that additional disclosure, additional clarity in the company. In terms of operating differently, no -- not yet so to speak. I mean we -- these people are coming to our board, we have an expanded board now of 12 directors. The discussions are going to be robust, as it always have been in terms of how do we do differently and the like. So we welcome that. But a lot of what we're doing right now, a lot of our -- a lot of these metric, a lot of this fine tuning of our investments and our plans and all of that, has been ongoing for some time now.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just coming back on the cost side of the business, 2 comments here or questions. One, you made a quick comment about your guidance for this year is recognizing stable asset-based fees. So if we do have a great year in terms of inflows -- what does stable asset-base fees mean and if there's upside to that, would that just flow through to the bottom line? And secondly, just going back to one of your earlier slides around where the expense growth has come from over the last couple of years in terms of organic investments, it looks like the organic growth has been about 4% per year. Is that a good number to use for outyears now? And if that is a number which is also contemplated every 2, 3, 4 years you have to go through another cycle of incremental investment spend. So again, like how are you thinking about the cost growth longer term, if there's any more color you can give.
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. So on the first question, the -- you noticed that a few times I mentioned, predicated or not, in a stable operating environment especially asset-based fees, what I really mean there is that if there is a better market in equities around the world, that's going to put some pressure on the margin, right, because that declines our revenues immediately and our cost structure will have to gradually adjust to that. So embedded in our expansion of margin is a continuation of some meaningful level of return in the equity markets in terms of appreciation, in terms of new product development, new product launches, new inflows and ETFs and the like. If that were to be -- if that equity environment of new product launches and equity values were to accelerate further from what we have, what we see here, that will expand the margin faster. And we will not be spending that incremental. Bob, do you want to address the second part?
Robert Qutub: Expense growth, if you look at the chart that Henry used, it showed in terms of organic, I think, it was $75 million, a lot of it was driven by the tremendous inflows that we talked about from ABF, I mean, a lot of that piece will be the volatility on that but we're continuing to generate the new products that we talk about, directly and indirectly, we're receiving benefits on it. So the investment returns that you see in here become organic. And we continue to use the investments to leverage the organic, that's where you're getting the growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I appreciated the breakout of the investments on Slide 14. Just looking ahead to the next year, where will your investments be focused? Would you expect that like it should be similarly proportional or are there certain areas or segments that have more opportunities than others that you're looking to invest in?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. So we -- Toni, I'm glad you like it, please continue to give us feedback, all of you, for all the things that you like to see. The -- at this point we're really, really focused, Toni, on what we've done so far, how do we capitalize on it and pay back and obviously creating efficiencies from that and all of that. We haven't yet started any kind of planning process as to what other areas of enhanced investment would occur because it's premature. We are -- but in general, we are very happy with the progress we're making. In fact, there's going to be more of that, clearly. We're really, really focused on this expansion of the PMA business and trying to broaden it to fundamental managers, not only the quantitative managers. Clearly, a lot of fundamental managers are looking at this onslaught of factor indices and passive management against the factor indices and a lot of what they do is one way or another in factor investing is qualitatively or quantitatively sometimes, right? So we need to provide tools for them to do that and get the business models continuing to grow. We're very focused on the -- we're very much focused on the return of the RMA business to significant growth. The last 2 years have been a bit more of trying to ensure that the technology platform that has served us well but reached the limit was invested in and we did a complete overhaul of that and so on and so forth. We now need to put more time and effort into launching new products and new services on that business in order to increase sales. I think we're happy with the retention rate. So those are areas and obviously you have the real estate and ESG part, which are really performing very well. So I think we're very focused on what we have today and making sure that it pays as opposed to expanding into any new areas.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And just one follow-up. On the index subscription revenue, I know Bob mentioned that there was some product timing in terms of why it was organically only about 5% this quarter. Was there anything else that we should be thinking about?
Robert Qutub: That was really driven by the pace and the supplemented disclosures back there, Toni, that shows that the revenues which in the real estate business, you recognize it when the products deliver. We had a slowdown in the fourth quarter. It's not affecting the pipeline, it was really more of timing, Toni. And that's why it dropped and you can see it decline 24%. That's sort of the small piece of it that brought it down to 5%.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I want to say I like the format very much and also welcome to Steve. So first question on margin. The first question on margins. I just want to understand the trajectory of the margin expansion. And just to be clear, when we're talking about margin expansion, you're talking year-over-year change in the adjusted EBITDA margin, just to be very clear so I don't misinterpret it. So are we talking that those margins are likely to be -- continue to be down on a year-over-year basis for the first and second quarters, and then starting in the third quarter they start to move up? And then finally, in the fourth quarter '15, you're going to show improvement. Is that the right interpretation on that?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, Bob is going to give you the answer, but before that, we do also welcome Steve and he's been hard at work to create all of this. We wanted to get him baptism by fire, so a lot of this is a lot of his efforts as well. Bob?
Robert Qutub: Bill, we're looking at -- we're going to have seasonality issues, which is why we provided the data table back on the supplemental disclosures. You see some of the fluctuations that happen with the real estate business that are out there. We're going to hit the first quarter like I talked about with some seasonal increases namely related around compensation. As we move through the second into third quarter, definitely, year-over-year progression margin, without a doubt. That's where we're moving towards and successively, we'll be working to progressively expand the margin each quarter. Again, we'll get some volatility with ABF but our inflows continue and the markets goes the way we're looking at, we should like to see it progressively for a while.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Is there anything that's changed in the business that would keep you from getting back up to the high levels of 46% that you had previously?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes, I think -- we don't see it that much, but obviously levels of competition will be something that we need to -- we monitor closely, that has been stable in the last year or 2, across. That's something we need to continue to look at, right, to make sure that we don't lose market position. No, I think all of you, in our discussions, both shareholders and analysts, have always, always recognize that there is an inherent expansion of margin in a business like ours because you have a relatively fixed cost structure that grows to a certain level and then the incremental revenues, the growth of incremental revenues is at a higher pace than the growth of the incremental cost structure. And on top of that, a lot of the product development that we do is enhancement of existing products and built off the existing cost infrastructure, right? So there is an inherent pressure there for the margin to rise. What we're trying to do, and this is always a debate, we're trying to do strongly is to not look at the next few quarters in terms of the health and the progress and the success of the business but to look at it on the medium-term for that process about 3, 4, 5 years to ensure that we're not sorry 3, 4 years from now that we haven't captured market positions and we're not in a position well in the areas that we want to be and get hurt. That was a little bit of the problem with the PMA business which we were harvesting the company or the business or the product line and not looking across the 3-, 5-year horizon. That should never happen to us again. So there will be a level of investment that we will need to keep in order to ensure that, that doesn't happen to us, but for sure, the embedded machine of MSCI as a grinding of gradually increasing profit margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Henry, you had mentioned that if the investments don't meet certain ROI thresholds, you would reconsider. How should we think about those thresholds in terms of ultimate returns relative to the business?
Robert Qutub: We look at -- first, when we're acquisition-related, we look at our acquisitions to be value accretive 3 to 5 years, that Henry pointed out in his comments. When you do organic investments, Kevin, I mean you're leveraging an existing infrastructure so the value accretion should be significantly higher, and we look for that. And -- but always the bottom of that would be the weighted average cost of capital. The timing, as we've talked about before, tends to be a little bit longer than acquisition sometimes, but we're looking at pretty significantly having ROIs much higher. If they fall below these high levels, they're competing for other investments that are out there.
Henry A. Fernandez: And Kevin, what we're telling you is that we're very dogmatic, we're very disciplined, we're very focused in how we look at everything we do. And our comment is attributed -- the large majority of what we've done in the last 2 years is paying back in a major way and we'll continue to pay back. There are a couple of pockets that we're evaluating, of things that we have done that are not performing at the level we wanted to see, and are evaluating whether we continue with them or not. Those are -- that's what we normally say at MSCI, the tail of the dog. The dog is really the majority of the investment plan that is working well, right? But we want to be truthful and tell you that we're looking at those as well.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: That's fair. And just, Henry, as you're working your way through the budgeting process, any sense, obviously, the fundamentals look pretty good, but people feeling better just relative to how budgets are coming together this year?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes, it's -- that's a question we always ask ourself because a year ago or so, people were feeling fairly good. At the end of last year with some of the news from Europe and geopolitical news and obviously slowdown in China and things like that, we monitor that like a hawk to try to see how the budget and spending patterns of our clients around the world are coming together. And we have not seen major change yet, right? So that's the good news. But we are monitoring that intensely because there are pockets -- big areas of the world, with the exception of the U.S., right, are slowing down and we want to make sure that we're getting our fair share of their budgets or even a higher share of their budgets, right, going forward. So we're monitoring that. But so far, we're fine, but that's an area -- meaning the pipelines are fine, the time approach, the pipeline and all of that, so -- but it's also that all of us keep looking [indiscernible].
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Stephen Davidson: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We took up a little bit more of your time than expected but we appreciate all your interest in MSCI. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your MSCI Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to now introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Roland, and good day, to everyone, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2014. A copy of that release may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You'll also find on our website a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they're made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, today's earnings release and our other filings with the SEC. Today's earnings call may also include a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: restructuring costs, the lease exit charge, the amortization of intangible assets, and nonrecurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, while adjusted EPS also excludes debt repayment and refinancing expenses, and the income tax effect of any excluded items. Adjusted EBITDA expense is total operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and the lease exit charge. Please refer to today's earnings release and Pages 15 to 19 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will be referring to run rate, as we always do, frequently in our discussion this morning. So let me remind you that our run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking revenues for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months, assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and EPS licensed to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to Table 10 in our press release for a detailed explanation. With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Edings. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're very pleased with our third quarter performance. We posted a strong financial results, especially with regards to revenues, which grew 10%. Adjusted EBITDA rose 1%, even as we invested in product development, sales and marketing and client service. And adjusted EPS increased 6%. We also had a strong operating quarter. Run rate grew 10%, sales rose 4%, and retention rates strengthened to an exceptional 95%. Most importantly, we're starting to see the early benefits of our stepped-up level of investment on new and existing products. Lastly, as a testament to our commitment to put excess work -- excess capital to work for shareholders, we announced last month our plan to return $1 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016. The strength of our operating performance this quarter is the most exciting point for me because we're starting to tie our progress directly to some of the investments we have made. Our innovation engine is picking up, and we can see it making a difference. Let me first provide some specific examples of how the increased pace of innovation is having an impact on the growth of our equity investment tools. A key driver of our equity index subscription sales is our relationships with pension funds and other asset owners. These clients use our indices to help them with asset allocation and performance measurement. Over the last year, we have expanded our sales force and our applied research teams, so that we can engage with these clients more frequently. That is paying off. As an example, during the third quarter, one of the largest corporate pension plans in the U.S. opted to use a full suite of MSCI indices, including our domestic U.S. indices, as the benchmark for their total equity assets. MSCI was also selected as the global policy benchmark by a number of major fund managers in Europe, in Australia and in Taiwan. Each win embeds MSCI indices more deeply into our clients' investment processes and lays another building block for future growth. The wins also helped us increase the more than $9 trillion of assets following MSCI indices, either actively or passively, and widened that lead in that important metric. Another way we're gaining in new investment mandate is from our pioneering work in factor index sales, otherwise known as smart beta indices. We have made significant investments in our research and production to enable us to introduce a greater number of these indices. A sizable number of the new mandates that we have won to date in Europe, for example, have been related to smart beta indices. Assets under management linked to our factor indices have grown 74% over the last 12 months to $113 billion. Innovation is also helping to drive share gains in the ETF market. Over the last 2 years, we have significantly invested in changing our approach to ETF providers. Over the first 9 months of 2014, we launched a total of 15 new index families and expanded 24 others, with much of that tailored to meet the needs of ETF providers. To put those numbers in context, in all of 2013, we launched 7 new index families and expanded 12 others. So we have effectively doubled the pace of new product development in 2014. The results are pretty clear. 28% of the total number of equity ETFs launched worldwide year-to-date were linked to MSCI indices. 32% of the total fund flows worldwide into equity ETFs went to MSCI-linked ETFs. Keep in mind that our overall share of the AUM of the equity ETF market around the world is about 19%. So for MSCI to garner almost 30% of all new equity ETF launches and 1/3 of all global new fund flows into equity ETFs is a very strong execution and a direct link to the investments we have made in this product line in the last 2 years. That same theme is also playing out in our equity analytics product line. MSCI continued to make progress in restoring this product line to growth during the third quarter. Over the first 9 months of 2014, we have launched a total of 13 new market models, and we continue to make significant improvements in Barra Portfolio Manager. In addition, we benefited from the investments we have made in client services and our consultant group, which contributed to an exceptionally strong retention rate in our equity analytics product line. On the multi-asset class side, one of the -- our key differentiators is our ability to deliver deep expertise across a wide range of asset classes, including the illiquid alternative asset classes, so our clients can better understand the drivers of risk and return in their total portfolios. In the third quarter, we signed a deal with one of the largest public pension plans in the U.S. to use our real estate models and our tools to backflip and rebalance their real estate portfolios. This is a great example not only of innovation, but also the growing power of the MSCI platform. We were able to offer a combination of a flexible portfolio construction tool, our real estate risk model build use of proprietary IPD data, all paired with a matched researched insights from our research teams, bringing together tools from all of our major product lines to provide critical insights to that particular client. That deal and others helped sales of our multi-asset class risk tool rebound a bit after a slow second quarter. We're also seeing a strong interest in new products that we have developed, such as our enhanced performance attribution. As you know, the product line retentions in our multi-asset class risk and performance product line remained very, very strong. So the common theme in all these examples is the link between client wins, early sales and our investment initiatives. Investments in sales and marketing helped us reach out to more clients and new client categories all over the world. Investments in client service helped us increase our overall retention rates. Investments in research and product development helped us to step up our level of product innovation to meet the demand of new indices, new market models and to process more and more portfolios and more complicated portfolios in our multi-asset class platform. Looking forward, we expect the pace of new investment to slow as we turn our energies and our attention towards maximizing the value of the investments that we have made so far. In 2015, this will bring our rate of expense growth much closer to that of our revenues. And in 2016, we expect the rate of growth of expenses to be in line with that of revenues. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to spend a moment discussing the enhanced capital return plan we announced last month. Let me summarize again the key points. MSCI will pay its first-ever quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 -- of $0.18 per share tomorrow. Our annual dividend rate is expected to be $0.72 per share. Our existing share repurchase authorization was increased to $850 million from $300 million. $300 million of that $850 million -- of the $850 million authorization was executed in the form of an accelerated share repurchase plan last month. And the combination of regular dividends and the buyback program is designed to return $1 billion to our shareholders by the end of 2016. The enhanced capital return plan is a reflection of MSCI's strong financial and operating position, and underscores our continued commitment to a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. It also underscores our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders. MSCI's focus on capital discipline is not new. Our board consistently seeks to balance the imperative of investing in our business, either organically or through acquisitions, and opportunities to return value to shareholders. At the completion of the most recent ASR and including dividends, MSCI will have returned more than $600 million to our shareholders. We're also committed to being a disciplined buyer of companies and businesses, and all potential acquisitions will need to fit within our strategy -- our core strategy and to meet financial hurdles of delivering returns above our cost of capital in the first 3 to 5 years of the acquisition. We are very disciplined in this approach, and we tend to stick to it over market cycles. Over the last 2 years, we have completed the bolt-on acquisitions of IPD, InvestorForce and most recently, we announced the acquisition of GMI Ratings. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a review of all of our numbers. Bob?
Robert Qutub: Thanks, Henry. Good morning to all of you on the phone. You can follow my comments with the slides that are available on our website, and we'll start on Page 4. On that note, you'll see third quarter 2014 revenues rose 10% to $252 million. That growth was roughly split between the subscription revenues, which grew by 6% and asset-based fees, which grew by 27%. Nonrecurring revenues also contributed modestly to our growth. By product, index and ESG product revenues rose 15%. Risk management analytics revenues rose by 6% and portfolio management analytics revenues were flat versus third quarter 2015 -- '13, excuse me. Details on our operating results are on Page 5, showing MSCI's total run rate grew 10% to $1 billion. Our total subscription fees grew by 8% to $823 million, driven by a 13% increase in index and ESG subscriptions, 3% growth in RMA and a 2% growth in PMA. Changes in FX had a big impact on our run rate in the third quarter, especially on our analytic product lines. Total changes in FX lowered our run rate by $10 million relative to the second quarter and by $8 million year-over-year. The acquisition of GMI added $7.5 million to the index and ESG product line. Excluding the impact of changes in FX and the acquisition of GMI, total subscription run rate grew by 8%, comprised of 11% growth in index subscriptions; 5% growth in risk management analytics; and 3% growth in portfolio management analytics. Turning to Page 6. Total sales rose 4% to $31 million. As Henry noted, MSCI's aggregate retention rates rose to 95% for the third quarter, rising across all 3 major product lines. Year-to-date retention was 94%. Now let's turn -- let's now review the performance of our 3 major product lines, beginning with our index and ESG product line on Page 7. Index and ESG revenues grew by $19 million or 15% to $148 million, led by strong growth in asset-based fees. Subscription revenues grew by 9% on an organic basis. Total index and ESG run rate grew by 15%, led by asset-based fees. Asset-based fee run rate grew 21%, driven by a 25% increase in assets under management linked to MSCI indices to $378 billion as of September 30. Index and ESG subscription run rate grew 13% to $405 million. Excluding the impact of FX changes and the acquisition of GMI, subscription run rate rose by 11%, with a strong growth in equity index benchmark and data products augmented by faster growth in run rate from ESG products and real estate data. Index and ESG sales rose 2% and the retention rate rose above 95%. As Henry noted and as shown on Page 8, the investments we have made to better serve ETF providers is paying off. Over the past year, AUM and ETF linked to the MSCI indices rose by $75 billion. Almost 90% of that change was the $65 billion that came from inflows, with only $10 billion coming from market appreciation. Looking at the third quarter by itself, the declining markets was almost entirely offset by $16 billion in inflows. Those are strong numbers and reflect -- a reflection of the investments we have made and the strength of our brand. Turning to Page 9. Risk management analytics revenues rose by 6% year-over-year and run rate rose by 3% to $311 million. Excluding the impact of FX, run rate rose 5%. The retention rate rose to 94% for the quarter and 92% year-to-date. Sales rose 4% versus third quarter of 2013 and were up 14% consecutively. On Page 10, you'll see portfolio management analytics revenues were flat in third quarter 2014. Run rate increased 2% and by 3%, excluding the impact of FX. The growth in run rate continues to be driven by both stronger sales, which rose 13% and by much stronger retention, which rose to 94% from 89% a year ago. And on a year-to-date basis, retention rates rose significantly to 93% from 86%. Growth in sales of portfolio management analytics products was also driven by new products. Sales of new market models and Barra Portfolio Manager accounted for more than 70% of total sales. Those new products, which are direct results of our stepped-up level of investments in new product development over the past 3 years, accounted for 100% of the net new growth in the product line over the past year. Now, let's turn to expenses on Slide 11. Adjusted EBITDA expenses have increased $70 million or 19% over the course of the first 9 months of 2013. As we indicated in our Investor Day last spring, the bulk of this new spending has gone to support product enhancements and new product development efforts. $44 million of that increase or 60% has gone towards product development. These investments have enabled us to increase our production of new factor and custom indices and new market models. We have also invested in expanding our data center footprint, which enables us to increase the volume of securities we process for our multi-asset clients. As Henry noted, we are starting to see the impact that these investments are having on our results, but the financial benefit of the 2014 product development spending is still small. If you recall, we indicated that we expect the new product development efforts to take 2 to 3 years before we start to see significant revenue benefits. Sales, marketing and client service accounts for 1/4 of the new expense. These investments have had a more immediate impact, helping us lift our overall level of sales over the year and contributing to the increase in our retention rates. During the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA expense rose by 17% to $150 million. The growth rate was below the 21% growth rate we reported in the second quarter of 2014 and the 18% growth in the first quarter. As I will highlight in my comments about guidance for next year, we expect this downward trend to continue in the fourth quarter and into 2015. Turning to Page 12. You'll see adjusted EBITDA grew by 1% to $102 million and adjusted EPS grew 6% to $0.50 per share. Moving to cash flow items on Page 13. MSCI generated operating cash flow of $108 million during the quarter and $202 million year-to-date. We spent $20 million in capital expenditures and repaid $5 million of debt. Our total debt balance at the end of the third quarter was $793 million. And as Henry noted, MSCI is committed to capital efficiency. During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of GMI Ratings, a provider of ESG rating and research that complements our own ESG efforts, for $15 million net of cash. We've used more capital to buy back shares. As part of the $1 billion enhanced capital return plan, MSCI entered into a $300 million ASR, which immediately reduced our share count by 4.5 million shares. In the meantime, we are prepared to move aggressively to keep our $1 billion capital return commitment. We ended the quarter with approximately $250 million of excess cash and stand ready to make open-market purchases if the opportunity arises. In total, we have repurchased 6.9 million shares as part of the 2 ASRs since the beginning of 2014, bringing our total share count down to 112 million shares at the end of third quarter. As a reminder, we continue to have the authorization to repurchase up to an additional $550 million worth of MSCI stock that we intend to use before the end of 2016. As you'll see from Slide 14, our guidance for 2014 remains unchanged. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA expense to be in the range of $595 million to $605 million. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million. We continue to expect that our full year tax rate will be approximately 36%. We also introduced some preliminary 2015 guidance when we announced the capital return plan and that, too, is unchanged. And I'll repeat it. We expect that the rate of adjusted EBITDA expense growth will decline significantly in 2015 versus the 17% to 18% growth implied by our 2014 adjusted EBITDA expense guidance, as we bring our rate of expense growth much closer to that of our revenues. We also noted at the time of the capital return that we intend to refinance our existing debt. The goal of the potential refinancing will be to increase our financial flexibility, take advantage of the current low interest rate environment and decrease our exposure to interest rate changes. Given current rates, we are exploring the refinancing of all of our outstanding debt. When completed, and assuming current market conditions, we expect interest expense to increase significantly from the annualized third quarter 2014 expense of $22 million. Before I turn it over to the operator, I would like to summarize the key points of this quarter on Page 15. One, MSCI generated strong financial results, including revenue growth of 10%. Two, our operating results are strong, obtained by a 10% growth in run rate and a 95% retention rate. And three, we are putting our capital to work for our shareholders in the form of our plan to return $1 billion to shareholders before the end of 2016. With that, I think we're ready to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Mihalos from Crédit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Maybe for starters, just to pick up on that point around the expense outlook for '15 and even beyond that. I think the commentary was, significant reduction in the rate of spend, something more similar although higher than the rate of revenue growth for '15. I was just wondering if you can parse that out a little bit more. Sounds like maybe we're looking at somewhere around 11% to 13% growth in expenses for '15. And then maybe the thinking around long-term margins even going beyond '16. I mean, should we be constantly looking for revenue growth and EBITDA growth to sort of be aligned?
Robert Qutub: George, Bob here. And, as you can see from our operating, our key metric for revenues is currently 10%. So that's a benchmark for a lot of our conversations. The growth rate in 2014 was significant, based on our projections, 17% to 19%. As we indicated, we'll bring that down significantly. And it's not until 2016, as Henry outlined, we expect to see that converge.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Is the longer-term thinking also, that revenue and margin should be converging, that you're just going to be driving higher -- excuse me, faster top line growth through more investment?
Robert Qutub: Our investments, as I said, will take 2 to 3 years to have the significant payback that we're looking at. And our focus is on profit. Our focus is on profit growth and growing meaningful profit growth, George.
Henry A. Fernandez: I think, George, it's also -- it's just too early to tell at the moment where do we end up at 2017 and beyond. Clearly, if a lot of our plan come to fruition of a significant payoff of the investment that we have made into much higher revenues and the operating environment is very positive, we may see a bit of an operating leverage in the business. But that's too early to tell, right? The environment is -- goes up and down, as you know. And in the last 2 years, we really are focused no longer on margin. We're focused always on what's the maximum amount of profitability that we can extract from this business going forward on absolute dollars per share. So that's our visibility at the moment and, therefore, it's early -- it's too early to tell how it all pans out in '17 and '18.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Appreciate that. Speaking about the environment, just wanted an update as to how that feels for you in terms of global sales. Were there any sort of pushouts of sales given some of the dislocation to the equity markets in the -- particularly at the end of the third quarter?
Henry A. Fernandez: Fortunately for us, we haven't really seen any impact of the volatility in the equity markets in our pipelines, in our sales. Obviously, you do see it in the market value of the ETFs, but that has been equally offset by the inflows of funds into MSCI-linked ETFs, so that has been a wash. So we don't see an impact. And maybe the temporary decline and the rapid uptick in the equity values has no impact [ph] at all. Obviously, it's early days to tell, but so far, so good for us.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's great to hear. And just last question for me. Nice to hear about the demand for more of the index launches. Wondering if you're looking at demand for more ETFs, if you can parse that out between domestic, here in the U.S., and international, what the demand trends might be there?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes, the demand for our licenses of our indices for ETFs is really all over the world. It's from the U.S, from Europe and, to some extent, from Asia. Asia is, as we all know, is a little bit behind in terms of the growth of the ETF market. But we're making some progress there in Hong Kong and in China and in other places, in Australia, as an example. So the bulk of the demand right now in terms of numbers and dollar amounts and the numbers of ETF launches, the dollar amounts are in the U.S. and Europe. And in Europe, we recently launched a number of factor indices lines and factor indices to launch of a number of ETFs there a couple of weeks ago. So we are -- we're very, very bullish. I'm very positive about this business and that is as a direct result over the last 2 years, we really have revamped significantly the way we attack this business, the conversation we have with clients, the support that we give ETF providers, with direct clients and also with marketing support, we have a significant outreach program to financial advisors. We have staffed up in our product manager teams. We've staffed up our new product teams in research. So all in, it's been quite a satisfaction to see the great progress we have made, and the results show in terms of the market shares of new launches and the market shares of new fund flows, given our overall aggregate market share.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo Securities.
William DiJohnson - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: This is Bill DiJohnson for Bill Warmington. I just have a few questions. You said you launched 83 new ETFs in the quarter using MSCI indices. How many were market weighted or factor-based products?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think the -- my recollection is that many of them were factor indices and, therefore, no [ph]. But we -- I think it'll be best if we follow up with you directly to give you the exact stats.
Robert Qutub: Yes. We'll get back to you. That was year-to-date. So we'll get back to you, okay?
William DiJohnson - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, that will be great. And then also -- so 13 new market models for Portfolio Management Analytics to date. How many were there launched in 2012 and 2013 for comparison?
Robert Qutub: Significantly less. I don't have the count in front of me, but we really -- the focus this year, as we talked about, was to commit to a cadence of -- I think we talked about 10 models this year. We're exceeding that performance, and we talked about a continued upgrades in our PPM software, and we fulfilled on that. So this is really -- we have BPM releases last year, but these are the ones that were more significant that we could drive a lot more sales through the BPM platform. So that's really the point that we're trying to make, that we're starting to see the efforts of our investments coming through at a greater cadence this year.
Henry A. Fernandez: And also satisfying has been that the sales of BPM this quarter exceeded the sales of pretty much every other product line. So that bodes really well for a continuation of the -- not only the content in terms of the models of the data, but also the software application that helps people run the data. As you know, we sell data directly to clients in the form of data, and we also sell it packaged with our software. So that's -- we feel very good about this business, and we'll hear from clients and the prospects and the pace of innovation.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: In risk management analytics, have you been disappointed that the segment hasn't been growing faster by now? I know this quarter was impacted by FX. But I think even organically, excluding FX, it was still only about 5% growth.
Henry A. Fernandez: The quarter -- Toni, the quarter-by-quarter sort of look at this business, as you know, it's chunky, right? There are some quarters that we do significantly better, other quarters that we do less. So we tend not to focus on the quarter-by-quarter sales, we tend to focus on what's happening in the pipeline. Are we adding things to the pipeline? Are we closing? Is the pipeline expanding? Or are things getting delayed? Or anything like that. So that's the major focus. We -- in the pipeline, the health of the business is very good. In terms of the number of clients around the world, the type of clients and all of that. Yes, I believe, and all of us believe that this business can do much better than it is doing right now. And that is what we're trying to -- what we're expecting for the next quarters and the next few years, that the rate of growth of this business should accelerate.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then when you think about fixed income indices, assuming that you're going to build them yourselves as opposed to making an acquisition, would you expect that -- like is there, I guess, something earmarked in your current investment plan to cover that? Or would that be incremental? And is it more of maybe a multi-year investment? And how long could that take to roll out the products out there?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. Definitely, our plans are to selectively look at parts of the fixed income market, and see where we can add value on a differentiated basis as opposed to launch with little growth [ph]. So going into next year and the year after, we will be allocating a part of the budget, not a very large part of the budget, but a small part of the budget to see how we can look at opportunities in the fixed income markets, but in areas that we add our own expertise, our own value, and that we can also create and also differentiate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: I wonder if you could give a sense, Bob or Henry, how we're thinking about the step-up in organic growth over the course of '15? And then just with those expenses, how should those kind of layer in over '15 as well? Is it more front-end loaded on '15 and then it gradually steps down? Or just -- any thoughts as we think about the model into '15?
Robert Qutub: Well, as Henry indicated, we're going to maximize the value of the spend that we've already committed and that we've already seen in our numbers. As we pointed out, the rate of growth on the year-over-year quarter basis is declining. We gave you a pretty good idea of what we're looking at. What I would focus in on and we've been talking about is the new models, the new software, the indexes that are going up. And yes, we're going to see investments that are going to pay off in our sales. And as Henry talked about, putting people on in different locations. As we go back to Investor Day, we talked about what are the products we're going to put out, what sales are we going to generate off of those and the run rate that we build, and you get to the significant revenue growth that we talked about from the Investor Day side [ph]. I'll turn you back to Barra Portfolio Manager. We talked about that as now because now it's really paying off in our business, but that started 3 years ago and it's really come through quite a journey. So you've seen us doing it before, we're doing it now and just keep an eye, we'll be very public on the new products, the AUMS that we're putting out there for you to see.
Henry A. Fernandez: And then also, Kevin, looking also at the, we ramped up the pace of investment in 2013. We ramped it up in 2014 as well. And when we go area by area in our company from geographic areas to product areas, to functional areas, we -- I think we all feel that we have done a lot. We are very comfortable with the investments that we have made and it's now time to focus or continue to focus on how do we make those as efficient as possible and as payback -- and the payback as large as possible before we entertain any kind of additional levels of investments. And that is a process that we've gone through in the company that we feel very comfortable with, and that we feel that what we've done will pay off. So therefore, there is already clearly an embedded run rate of expenses associated with all of that, that takes you into the future -- the near-term future. But what we're trying to do is now layer on top of that in order to maximize what we've already done. And therefore -- I think you're just going to see a gradual decline quarter-by-quarter of significance in order to converge to the pace of growth of revenues at some point in 2016.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: That's helpful. And then, Henry, any thoughts on -- obviously, there's been some M&A activity in this sector. Any sense of -- from a competitive perspective, has that helped capture some incremental share and how you're positioning relative to that?
Henry A. Fernandez: It's -- in terms of a relative competitive landscape, it's too early to tell on significant numbers. We continue to gather market share, especially in the U.S. domestic benchmark market. If you think about, clearly, the largest market share that we have is American money in terms of the U.S. or it's American money invested overseas and a benchmark to MSCI. We continue to make significant inroads in U.S. money invested in U.S. equities and using MSCI as the benchmark. Well, it's a gradual process that takes place. So we're seeing that and we expect to continue to see that in the context of the competitive landscape. I think on some of the other areas, it's too early to tell at this point.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: And then finally, if I could. Any sense of how initial budget discussions -- is it too early in terms of how clients are thinking of '15, or just -- any preliminary indications as they start the budget process into '15?
Henry A. Fernandez: You mean our budget process or our clients' budget?
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Your clients' budgets.
Henry A. Fernandez: It's too early to tell at the moment. But every indication that we get from clients is that their budgets are not shrinking going into '15. It doesn't mean we're starting to pull market days [ph] in which our people are expanding generously. But every indication that we have in our dialogue with clients is that they are really going back to a more business-as-usual as opposed to a bunkered down, siege mentality that they have been in the last few years. And a lot of it is because their business models -- not only the equity values are healthier, but their business model is healthier. They're beginning to -- the mutual fund complex are launching new funds. Pension plans are given different types of mandate. People are beginning to expand into other geographic areas and the like. There is not as much consolidation of the asset management industry and so on and so forth. But there are pockets of -- or significant areas of caution, right? In the European market, clearly has an economic slowdown there. So we have to see how that impacts, in China as well. U.S. is a very good market for us, obviously, given the outperformance economically and in terms of markets as well. So I think that 2015 will be an incrementally good year for us and for our clients.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: On the RMA business, the retention rate there looked quite a bit better than it has been. So can you talk about what drove the improvement over what were already pretty good levels? And I find it particularly interesting, since I know some of the competitors in that business have become more aggressive over the last, let's say, 9 or 12 months. So anything to read into the quarter?
Henry A. Fernandez: We have focused really intensely on our retention rates. So if you sit back at the end [ph] and look at the totality of the environment, we have known clearly for a couple of years that making your numbers strictly on new sales to clients at a time in which the budgets are relaxing, but not expanding dramatically. Therefore, in order to get your run rate growth to levels that are acceptable, we are very much focused on what do we do to retain as much of the book as possible. And therefore, some time ago, 2 or 3 years ago, we started focusing on the renewal of a contract with the client way ahead of time, how is the client using the product, what kind of support do we give them, what experiences are they having with the client experience process that we go through, what experience are they having, are they getting their -- the processing of their portfolios in the case work turned in on time? And things like that. So in the last 1.5 years, we put a lot of effort into the performance of the processing, the stability of the processing, the servicing of the client directly, the advising to the client as to how to do all of that, and that has paid back in spades, in spades, to this exceptionally high retention levels. We have fortified enormously our technology team. We added Chris Corrado, a year or so ago. She's a real pro and a leader in technology. She's brought in a team of senior technologies that are in state-of-the-art in technology. We put a lot of effort in data quality on these client experience and the integration between the client service people all the way back to the technology people. So a lot of this has been hard work and investments. But as you can see, it's paying back in spades.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: All right. Henry, and then you talked about a strong pipeline. I mean, it's somewhat complex with -- although, I realize the short-term data point, just the decline sequentially in the sales. Just curious if you could flesh out for us as investors, how do you qualify the pipeline? I mean, how do you measure the pipeline? And if you can't share any quantitative metrics, what is it that gives you confidence? Is it a higher number of inbound client inquiries, higher number of meetings, et cetera?
Henry A. Fernandez: That was a very good question. And as I said before in answer to Toni's question, we feel good about where we are in terms of sales with the RMA business, but we can do a lot better than this, right? And I don't want to mince any words. We can do better than this. This is a business that, over time, should be growing much faster. And therefore, we're very focused on what are the areas of the market where growth is faster. So for example, asset owners and consultants, that's an area of the market that we're doing really well and, therefore, can we double-up on that, right? We're doing very well in Asia in risk management analytic sales. We -- our growth rate there is in the high teens, low 20s. So can we put more effort into that area? We're beginning to have a revival of sales in pensions that for some time they were very challenged. Can we put more effort there? We have areas of weaknesses. The banks have been weak. Pretty much every spending by the banks on risk management analytics has been only for regulatory agreement purposes. So we say, "Okay, why don't we -- can we slow down a lot of the push into that area?" Asset managers in Europe and in the U.S. given -- especially in Europe, given the challenging kind of view of the environment, we have -- it has been a little bit weaker for us. And Europe, in general, has been weaker for us. So I think what we're trying to focus on is, how do we look at the areas of higher growth and put a lot more efforts there? And before we were trying to -- we have been trying to cover everything. So how do we reassign our efforts? And then secondly, how do we try to integrate a lot more than we have done before between -- just like the example I gave with that pension plan, right? Between our portfolio management analytics tools, our risk management analytics tool, the content that we produce in IPD and ESG and index, how do we package it all into an integrated process and integrated platform to drive more sales? And we're very hopeful and very optimistic that, that will yield very good results.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I was wondering, could you give us a rough timeframe around how long it takes for either a new software product or some change in the index or new index to pay off? Are we looking at a 3-, 6- or 12-month time frame? I'm just trying to gauge a rough idea of what we can expect from all the investments.
Robert Qutub: Yes, Joe, I will go back to the comments that I was making earlier. It's -- it was part of the near-term investments when we make investment in sales, people or coverage teams that are out there, those are nearer. But we are talking the notable new products, a really good example would be Barra Portfolio Manager. In our comments, we said, we're in our third year of that development, we're starting to see the meaningful sales and the retention rates in there. Indexes can be varied. I mean, an index, we've put them out there. It's a question of how long it takes sales of AUMs to get attracted to those indexes. And as we said in our Investor Day, that we developed these indexes, these models and these software updates in close connectivity with our clients. And so we believe going into it, there's client-correlated demand. And as we've indicated, to keep an eye on the sales of those products as they are released.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then just on the competitive environment, in general. Have you seen any changes in either win rates or pricing, which I know is usually pretty static? And it seems like, obviously, we've had a very good run as far as passive investment is concerned. I'd like to get your overall view of where we are in the cycle, if we are in one, and where you think it's going to head over the next couple of years?
Henry A. Fernandez: The competition has remained more or less where it was the last few quarters. The more positive news has been that on the index business, we have gained more -- even more share in competition, particularly in those areas that we are being traditionally strong, such as domestic benchmarks for countries. I gave the example of the U.S. a few minutes ago, right? So that has been pretty good. We have increased our share equated with [ph] the competition on factor indices quite dramatically. On the portfolio management analytics product line, we have won more than we have lost completely in terms of competition there. We actually have brought back clients that we have lost in the last 3 or 4 years. So that's been pretty good. On the run rate, the competition is pretty stable there from what it has been in the last few quarters. So now what's going to happen? I think that within most of the areas going forward, we will be even more competitive. We will gain more share as a whole in the company. And in all areas, we'll fight out stronger [ph], right? But it's too early to tell.
Operator: And I'm showing no more questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
C. D. Baer Pettit: Thanks, Roland. We want to thank everyone on the call for their interest and ownership of MSCI, and we hope you have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Speakers, please stand by.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank all of you for joining our second quarter 2014 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter of 2014. A copy of that release may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You'll also find in our website a slide presentation that we have prepared to accompany this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they're made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2013, other SEC filings and today's earnings release. Today's earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: after-tax income from discontinued operations, the lease exit charge and the amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements while adjusted EPS also excludes the income tax effect of the excluded items. Adjusted EBITDA expenses consist of operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and lease exit charges. Please refer to today's earnings release and Pages 15 through 18 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Henry Fernandez.
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Edings, and good morning, everyone. MSCI reported strong second quarter results. Our revenues of $254 million are up 11% versus the prior year, and our run rate grew organically by 12% to $987 million. Adjusted EBITDA was flat at $106 million as we made important strides in executing on our investment plan. Our diluted earnings per share rose 82% as a result of the gain from the sale of ISS. Bob, later on in the call, will review the numbers that we reported this quarter. I would like to share with you my own takeaway from the second quarter results. First, we had strong operating results driven in part by the investments we have made in our business. Second, we are well underway in executing on the investment plan that we laid out on our Investor Day in March. We're starting to see some of the benefits of our stepped-up level of investments in the form of higher sales, strong retention rate and new product launches. And third, as a result of the progress we are making and viewing a continued strong demand for our products, we have decided to increase the scope of our investment plan for the balance of 2014 and for all of 2015 in order to take full advantage of that strong demand for our growth and to accelerate our efforts to upgrade our technology platform to continue to service our clients. Let me start first with a review of our operating results as it relates to our equity investment tools. Global equity market have performed well in recent quarters, so it should be not a surprise that sales of our equity investment tools are helping to fuel our operating results. Equity tools at MSCI, including equity indices, equity portfolio analytics and ESG tools, account for 64% of our total aggregate run rate at the firm and helped drive the acceleration we reported in our overall business. A big contributor to that higher growth has been the investments that we have made in these products over the past few years, and I'm here to give you a few examples of those investments and the results that we have seen due to them. Sales of equity index subscriptions rose more than 30% versus the second quarter of 2013. Over the past 18 months, MSCI has grown our global index sales force, expanded our presence in new markets and added to our product management team in every region of the world. Those investments are enabling us to continue to combine a global product scope with an increasingly local and regional focus on the needs of our clients in each market. These global/local strategy is helping drive double-digit run rate growth in countries like Canada and Korea, where we have added sales resources. It has also paid out in the form of our -- of new clients in new countries, such as the first-ever client that we got in Colombia, Latin America and also many other notable wins that we have had. These investments are helping us gain share in the U.S. market, where a major asset manager recently made the decision to switch the benchmark for its global funds to MSCI and away from our competitor. We're also increasing significantly our focus on the domestic U.S. equity assets in order to take advantage of the increasingly global approach for our U.S. clients in terms of their equity investment strategies. These efforts were rewarded with several notable U.S. domestic benchmark wins during the second quarter. In Asia, we transfer a senior index executive to Shanghai from London in 2012 with a mandate to build a regional product management team. The additional focus of this team, plus the sales team in Asia Pacific, has helped us win 47 new clients over the first half of this year. Each of these new clients and benchmark wins are small in the context of our total business. But in aggregate, the small wins have been the building block of the rapid growth of MSCI indices over the past 18 years. And staying with our equity index products, asset-based fees were a big contributor to MSCI's overall growth in the second quarter. More than 50% of the growth in ETF assets under management linked to MSCI indices was the result of positive fund flows, rather than simply market performance. That sticks to the widespread appeal of MSCI indices to investors in this ETF and is also due to the investment that we have made to better serve our ETF clients worldwide. Over the past 2 years, we have increased the size of our broad management teams to enable our senior managers spend more time on the ETF market. We have designated senior salespeople to focus solely on our ETF provider -- in our ETF manager client and have dramatically increased our investment in marketing. We also began to invest more heavily in our index production capability in order to increase both the number of indices that we create, as well as to take on the added complexity inherent in producing factor indices. All these efforts are paying off. Over the first 6 months of 2014, MSCI-linked ETFs have gathered a net total of USD 29 billion of new fund flows. This is a third of all flows into equity ETFs worldwide. That is almost twice as much as the flows of the second-ranked index provider this quarter. In addition, 75 new ETFs, based on MSCI indices, began trading during the quarter, accounting for more than 1/3 of all new equity ETF launches. Again, that is significantly more than any other index provider in the world. We're also starting to see some of the benefits of our investment in our index production capacity. We launched as many index families over the first half of 2014 as we did for all of 2013, including new fair value indices, and continue to launch factor-filtered indices. Continuing on our equity tools. It was gratifying to see a return to run rate growth for our equity portfolio management analytics. The growth in PMA is the direct result of a decision that we made in 2011 to step up our level of investment in this product line. Over the past 3 years, we have overhauled and expanded the management team in PMA, sharply increased our investment in new product development and invested heavily in client service. Our investments in client service and in upgrading our existing products began to pay off last year in the form of increased retention rates. The investments in new products took longer, but we started to see a growing stream of new products introductions over the course of 2013. In this most recent quarter, we're starting to see tangible evidence that these new products are having a meaningful impact on new sales, not just on increasing the retention rates that began to happen last year. These 2- to 3-year lag from new product investments to meaningful increases in sales is not unusual in our business, and it is worth bearing in mind when we think about the impact of our current investment plan. Continuing on our equity tools. Another example of where our investments are beginning to bear fruit is in our ESG product line. When MSCI acquired this product line as part of RiskMetrics in 2010, we have been coupled together via string of acquisitions that had never been integrated. It took us 2 years of investments to rationalizing the product line, upgrading the technology infrastructure, adding to the sales force and investing in the product management team before MSCI was really in a position to tap into the growing demand for ESG products. All of these efforts over the last 3 or 4 years have helped drive now a run rate growth of our ESG products to the high teens to low 20s, including a 23% growth in the run rate in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of GMI Ratings, a complementary provider of ESG ratings and research, and this is expected to close in the third quarter. The acquisition of GMI, we'll view as a propriety data source from a range of corporate governance data and will broaden the product line for all of ESG. While sales of our equity tools have been strong, sales of our tools to multi-asset class investors were slower in the second quarter. Despite this slowdown, MSCI continued to make progress in targeting key accounts and enhancing our products. This off-sale figures was driven in part by the timing of contract signing. You have heard us talk over and over again about our multi-asset class tool sales being bumpy. Some quarters, a little higher, some quarters, a little lower, so therefore, it is important to not -- not to draw too many conclusion on a single quarter of sales. Our pipeline in this product line remains healthy, and client activity remains robust. We had some notable wins in the quarter, including another large U.S. public pension fund. That fund selected MSCI because our long-term risk models and the coverage of private asset classes matched their investment approach, and because of our managed services offering would simplify their use case and ability to operate the software platform. We also had important wins this quarter in our RMA business or our liquidity risk products. On the multi-asset class product line front, we introduced an updated version of our BarraOne multi-asset class risk platform, adding new analytical features and further expanding our asset class coverage. As part of our global focus on enabling our clients to get more insights into their investments in alternative asset classes, we also added coverage of European and Asian markets to our private equity risk model. In each of the examples I have cited this morning, our expanded lineup of ETFs, the greater focus on new markets in Asia and MSCI's growing role as a provider of risk management systems to asset owners, our success has been the result of investments that we have made in our product development teams, our sales and client service and our technology platform. Each success gave us the confidence to expand our program in the middle of 2013, which we outlined to you on Investor Day, and we're making good progress on executing on that plan. Today, we're announcing an additional expansion of our investment plan. While we will lay out the impact of our new investments and what the impact that they will have in our 2014 expenses, so let me give you a quick rundown of where we're investing these additional resources. First, our clients rely on our technology infrastructure to perform mission-critical calculations that they need to better understand risk and performance in their portfolios. At the same time, they are asking us to handle many more portfolios with much more complex securities and even more global in nature and at much faster rate. We're adding to our storage capacity and we are buttressing our infrastructure and technology to increase our overall capacity while enabling us to more rapidly and thoroughly try out new product releases for our clients. Secondly, today, our clients access our risk and performance tools over several different platforms at MSCI, and we are committed to enabling these platforms and continue to improve their accessibility. Many clients though, especially those in Europe, want to access the full range of MSCI tools and data on a single integrated platform. To meet that demand, we are adding to our software and technology development teams to begin the process of creating a unified technology platform that can cover many of our products, from equity indices to risk -- portfolio management analytics to risk management analytics and beyond. Our increased level of investment will enable us to begin building for the future while, at the same time, making the enhancements to our existing platforms that are needed to continue to service our clients and grow. Thirdly, as I noted at the outset, we are seeing a strong demand for our index products. In order to take full advantage of that growing demand, we will be increasing our investment in our index production capabilities in order to speed our time to market for new indices and to put us in a position to increase our asset class coverage. We will also be investing more heavily in sales and marketing with the goal of deepening our relationship with our existing clients and accelerating our efforts to reach out to new client segments, so just insurance companies and especially private wealth management firms around the world. We will also be further increasing our focus on the U.S. domestic market and in stepping up our investment there in new product development and in client service and in client outreach. We are pursuing many of these strategies today. And our incremental index investment will enable us to do more, faster than we have previously planned, and we're hoping that, that will eventually accelerate our rate of growth of this product line. Lastly, the fourth driver of our higher planned spending is obviously the acquisition of GMI, and Bob will touch upon that later on. These investments will have an impact on both 2014 and 2015. But we believe that they will strengthen our ability to provide our global clients with world-class products and services, and they will drive higher sales, higher profitability and, therefore, higher shareholder value in the years to come. Let me name out some of my comments before I turn the call over to Bob. One, we had strong second quarter. Two, our growth is being driven by the investments that we are making in our business. And then three, we are increasing our investment levels in 2014 and 2015 as we seek to develop new tools to help our clients understand the risk and opportunities in their portfolios, to enhance our technology and to expand our sales and client service and marketing efforts worldwide. Bob?
Robert Qutub: Thanks, Henry, and hello, everyone. Let's go ahead and get right into the numbers. Our revenues grew by 11% to $254 million. Subscription revenues continued to be the biggest absolute driver of our growth, and they grew by 10%. Asset-based fees rose 19% and nonrecurring revenues declined slightly. By product, index and ESG product revenues rose 14%, risk management analytics revenues rose by 11% and portfolio management analytics revenues rose 1%. Income from continuing operations increased 1% to $57 million, and we recorded a gain in net income for discontinued operations at $48 million related to the sale of ISS, which closed on April 30. And as you recall from the first quarter of 2014, we reported a $31 million noncash benefit associated with the proposed sale. So the total book gained on the sale of ISS was $79 million. Diluted EPS rose 82% to $0.91 per share, thanks largely to a gain from the sale of ISS, and adjusted EBITDA was flat with adjusted EPS rising 6% to $0.55 per share. We had another good operating quarter, as Henry outlined. On a subscription run rate -- excuse me, on a run-rate basis, our total subscription business grew by 8% to $810 million. Subscription run rate growth was comprised of a 12% increase in index and ESG subscriptions, 5% growth in RMA and a 2% growth in PMA. Subscription sales rose 6% to $29 million, and MSCI's retention rates rose to 93%. Changes in foreign currency had a positive impact on run rate at $7.2 million year-over-year and the sequential impact was just under $1 million. Now let's turn to the performance of each of our 3 major product groups, starting with our index and ESG products where revenues grew by $18 million or 14% to $150 million. Index and ESG revenues received a boost from the seasonal strength in real estate products revenues, which increased by $5 million sequentially. Total index and ESG run rate grew by 18%. Index and ESG subscription run rate grew 12% to $394 million, led by growth in equity index benchmark and data products. Index and ESG run rate also benefited from strong growth and demand for ESG products and for IPD real estate data. Index and ESG sales rose 14%, and retention rates remained strong at 94%. Changes in foreign currency lifted our run rate by $4 million year-over-year and by just over $0.5 million sequentially. Asset-based fees revenues grew 19% to $44 million, and the run rate rose 34% to $177 million. Assets under management and ETFs linked to MSCI indices at June 30 rose $109 billion or 40% versus a year ago to $379 billion. Of that increase, inflows into MSCI-linked ETFs accounted for $61 billion and market appreciation accounted for $48 billion. Inflows continue to be the biggest contributor to AUM growth in the second quarter as well, accounting for $23 billion of the $38 billion total change. Risk management analytics revenues rose by 11% year-over-year, aided in part by the timing of revenue from implementation projects, and the run rate rose 5% to $310 million. Retention rates in the quarter were largely stable at 92%, and FX changes lifted run rate by $3 million year-over-year but have little impact sequentially. We had a slow sales quarter in RMA, which contributed to an 18% decline in sales and a deceleration in our run rate growth versus prior quarters. Part of the decline can be attributed to a relative handful of deals which were delayed during the quarter and which can be expected to close in the third quarter. Our overall pipeline remains healthy. Moving on to PMA. We're pleased to see more signs of recovery for this product line. Revenues increased 1% to $26 million, and run rate grew 2% to $106 million. FX changes had a very modest benefit on both year-over-year basis, as well as sequentially. The revenue run rate growth at PMA are evidence that the investments we have made in these products, both in terms of developing new products, as well as in sales and service, are starting to pay off. On the new products side, our new market models and enhanced software platform helped our product line to have the strongest sales quarter in 3 years, at the same time, while modest enhancement to our existing products, coupled with an increased investment in client service, helped push our quarterly retention rate to its highest level since 2008. Again, lone quarter does not make a trend but these results are encouraging for PMA because we can trace the results back directly to the investments we have undertaken. Our investment plan continues, and that is having an impact on our expense items, as Henry outlined. Our adjusted EBITDA expense rose 21% to $148 million. Total compensation expenses rose 17% to $103 million. The growth in compensation expense was driven by the 18% increase in our headcount to just over 2,700 employees. The percentage of our workforce in lower cost centers grew to 49% from 43% a year ago and 47% last quarter. Non-compensation expense, which excludes depreciation and amortization, rose 31% versus a -- versus second quarter 2013 as we strengthened our technology infrastructure and added to our overall footprint. Increases in other items, such as professional services, occupancy and recruiting costs, also contributed to the increase. Relative to the first quarter, we spent more on professional services and IT, as well as T&E, recruiting and other costs. Adjusted EBITDA rose slightly to $106 million. Adjusted EPS rose 6% on the back of a modest increase in income from continuing operations and a 4% decline in diluted shares outstanding. Now turning to the balance sheet. The total cash proceeds from the sale of ISS were $367 million. Those proceeds, along with normal cash generation, helped push our total cash balance at the end of the second quarter to $683 million, of which $71 million is held offshore. MSCI generated operating cash flow of $69 million during the quarter, and we spent $12 million in capital expenditures and repaid $5 million of debt, leaving a total debt balance of $798 million. We also closed out a February 2014 ASR in May. As part of that process, we acquired another 600,000 shares, bringing the total share repurchase as part of the program to $2.3 million with an average purchase price of $43.10 per share. And we also continue to have the authorization to repurchase up to an additional $300 million of MSCI stock, and we'll evaluate all options for the use of our cash, including a return of capital or acquisitions that would meet our strategic criteria. Speaking of acquisitions, MSCI announced a small acquisition, GMI Holdings, for $15 million, which we can expect to close in the third quarter. That acquisition is expected to contribute modestly by $2 million to the index and ESG run rate. Before I conclude, let me review our updated financial guidance for 2014. We expect our adjusted EBITDA expenses to be in the range of $595 million to $605 million, an increase from our prior guidance of $569 million to $582 million. As Henry discussed, our revised guidance includes new spending initiatives for our index product line, additional spending on our IT infrastructure and new sales investment as it also incorporates the impact of the acquisition of GMI ratings. We expect our cash flow from operations to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. That guidance is unchanged. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, and that's a slight narrowing of our original $45 million to $55 million range. And finally, we continue to project that our full year tax rate will be approximately 36%. And one final note. I mentioned the seasonal strength of revenues from our real estate products benefiting our index and ESG product line during the quarter. We are now past the seasonal peak, and we expect that our revenues from those real estate products will decline by $6 million to $7 million sequentially. So please, factor that into your expectations for the third quarter. With that, I think we're ready to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just wanted to start on the expenses. I guess the comment I would make -- rather the new expense guidance. The comment I would make is I think -- you, Bob, in particular, last time we talked, a couple of months ago, I think the question was actually raised like how you feel about the guidance, and I think the comment you made was like, look, it almost like this is the first time we gave some guidance and this is what we should get measured against. And today, you're obviously raising that guidance again, and you obviously, over the last couple of quarters, have a history of changing your tone on the expense and on the investment spending. So I obviously hear your outline on seeing all these opportunities, but maybe a little bit more of like what changed, when that thinking changed and how we can expect you to not, last -- next quarter, come back with the same story and see more investment spending. And does this strength continue? I think you know what I'm getting at.
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, look, we live in a dynamic world, in a rapidly changing world, and we need to change and adapt to a new world, particularly when we see significant opportunities ahead of us. So nothing that would say we'll never set this [indiscernible] will never be forever, right? So what we see now is incredible amount of opportunity. Especially in the index business, we see enormous demand for indices, for passive investing. We see enormous demand for factor indices to create all sorts of products in ETFs and institutional passive and the like. We see a significant amount of demand compared to a couple of years ago in benchmark indices around the world and the like. You will see, obviously, a lot of demand in ESG. It's a trend that is continuing and the like. So we evaluated with our Board of Directors this summer. We do a manual strategy outside with our board to try to understand what's happening in our environment, what opportunity exists. And our board and the management team concluded that we needed to step up our ability to meet that demand so we can generate, over time, better products for our clients and, hopefully, more revenue opportunities for also in our shareholders.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then I guess just -- on the PMA business, in particular. I mean, that's obviously a nice turnaround there. Could you just talk a little bit more about maybe the lumpiness in this business? I mean, is this one quarter that benefited from a lot of strong sales? Or is the pipeline still very strong? I mean, the way I calculate it -- and I don't know if you look at that metric like this. But it's like net sales rose like 10%, 11%. I mean, that's a very, very big turnaround. So is that -- are those kind of like the numbers you're going to continue to expect? Or can this continue to be lumpy this year, in particular as, you're just turning the corner, I guess?
Henry A. Fernandez: Look, I think it could be lumpy. The pipeline is very healthy, the dialogue with our clients is very robust. We feel very good about slew of new product introductions that we have made in the last 12, 18 months, from a large number of new risk models that we have launched to the almost completion of a lot of the functionality in our Barra Portfolio Management software application. The environment for quant investing is changing also, to the better. Many of our tools are now reaching "much more than ever before" fundamental asset managers, not just the quantitative managers or the quant support of the fundamental managers. So -- but it could be lumpy, right? I mean, it's -- we've been here before, and things have gone up and down. What is new now is that this is very much predicated on a very strong tightness with our client that is reflected in the high retention rates is we have a lot of trials going on with customers of new products, both on the content side with the models with -- and the software side. So it feels -- the environment feels a lot better. Our position feels a lot better. But it's obviously early days to say that we completely turned around the business. And it could be that we end up in a few quarters on a bumpy basis, but it feels a lot better. And the pipeline is very good, and the dialogue with client is very good. And also, importantly, our competitive position -- I mean, this business is competitive. We feel very good in any of the -- our fees that we go to, and we're gaining quite a lot of share compared to our competitors in this space, sir.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Could you break out how much of the increase in the expense guidance is from the GMI acquisition versus higher spending in more organic areas? And can you clarify if the spending in the organic areas is still proportional roughly to what you laid out in Investor Day? Or is there more spending on IT infrastructure?
Robert Qutub: I think that the -- first, I'll start with the second question, is the allocation of our spend is still more than 50% allocated in product development and support. And as Henry outlined, we're still continuing to work on sales and marketing. With respect to GMI, we really -- we're still going through the early days. But as a piece of our increase, maybe 20%, 25% of the increase of our cost that we're looking at in our guidance here. We also have some investments to go with integration and things of that sort. But we'll lay that out in more of a detail. But again, it is small. And like I said, we'll have a modest "just a few million dollar" increase to our index and ESG overall run rate.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. And you mentioned that there was an issue with timing of sales in RMA that didn't close in 2Q, that you expect to close in 3Q. Can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of that?
Robert Qutub: It was a modest amount. It was a handful of few large deals that we fully anticipate to close, and we'll see the benefit in the third quarter. I'm not going to give you any amount of it, but it was a substantial amount, a good number of sales here in Americas.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos from Crédit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Wanted to circle back on the expenses again. Maybe if you can help us sort of provide some color as to what you're thinking is for 2015? For '14, I know you've had an increase of about, call it, $90 million to $100 million in expense. When you talk about investing or continued investing '15, is there a way to think about that, maybe in terms of absolute dollars or some metric like that?
Robert Qutub: I think there's 2 ways to look at it, very similar to the way we laid it out for you during Investor Day. We're stepping up on our spend for the balance of this year, so you'll see an annualization of it, George, going into 2015. And these opportunities will continue to -- as these opportunities continue to present themselves, as Henry outlined, we'll continue to spend on and through 2015 on new investments as we see them.
Henry A. Fernandez: So I think, George, also, the -- look, we are -- we're entering a very positive world here. If you think about -- and reflect back on -- in the last, say, 2 years, from about, say, May of 2011, 3 years, May of 2011 to now, we had the sovereign debt crisis in the summer of 2011 that began to create a lot of problems, then we have in the U.S. budget crisis and then we had problems in Asia and all that. So for a period of 2 last years -- I mean, 9 quarters, the operating environment was challenging. And we kept talking in this call, every single call, with a -- we kept talking about the challenging operating environment. That environment began to turn right around last summer, maybe early fall, and it accelerated quite a lot to December. And on a trended basis, things took -- continued to move forward and accelerate, especially in the equity index -- in the equity business overall, in the last 6 months. So we have been cautious in over a period of 2, 2.5 years because of the operating environment. We are now being increasingly pushed extremely hard by our client to meet their demand and their requirement of -- they're beginning to create new products, they're beginning to go into new territories and the like. It's not global years by any means. It's not open checkbooks by their budgets or even like that. But there is a marked -- a very, very distinct and marked difference from about a year ago. Our business has lagged, right? Products, it takes time for those to get monetize on the like. So they are -- we're beginning to adjust to that more positive operating environment, and we're doing it gradually because we want to make sure that we're not jumping into things too fast. We do it gradually. And that's what we did last summer, that's what we did in Investor Day, that's what we did with our board this summer, and that's we'll get paid to do, right? I don't get paid to do -- to sit here and pretend the world doesn't change, right? We get paid to analyze the operating environment, to size up the opportunity and to see what that investment will entail. So far, we're comfortable where we are, but we're going to take another look at this in -- at the beginning of next year and say, what does the environment look for 2015 and shall we remain at the current expense levels and investment levels or should we step it up? We don't know yet. Right now, we're comfortable where we are. But for sure, if we see a continued acceleration of the positive environment, we're likely to accelerate the investment plan. If we don't, we'll probably be more cautious.
Robert Qutub: What we did do about these investments are tied to our revenue growth, and we feel confident. The other part of your question, George, is during report [ph], we're really not -- we're not focused on a margin expansion. We're focused on growth over time.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And just a follow-up. Henry, you sound a lot more upbeat about the U.S. opportunity. You highlighted a nice wind there as well. What's changed in the environment? Is it your spending? Is it your approach to the sort of the domestic market? What's making you a little bit more bullish on your opportunities there on the index side?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. So to be very specific, what we -- what I was referring to is the increasing trend of U.S. institutional investors, about pension plan, mutual fund complexes and wealth management and the like, to look at the other equity investment on a global perspective as opposed to chalk it all up between domestic equities, developed market equities, emerging market equities, small cap equities and the like. So we're beginning to see -- we continue to see -- not beginning to, we continue to see the trend and, potentially, an acceleration of the trend of our U.S. institutional clients of saying, "It's one world, one equity world, and therefore, our -- we should be benchmarked to one equity -- global equity benchmark in which the domestic U.S.A. is a component of that as opposed to a separate, distinct benchmark to that." So therefore, we want to put -- we see that trend. We've been participants of it. We see it developing. We put resources on that. We want to put more and more resources on that, because if we do, we're going to continue to gain market share and the money invested by U.S. investors in U.S. equities, right? And we feel pretty upbeat about that development.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So I had a follow-up question on the 2015 expenses. So the way I was trying to look at it is if you did $143 million in the first quarter, $148 million in expenses in the second quarter and it looks like to get to the midpoint of the new guidance at $600 million, you need about $154 million in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Is that a good run rate to use going into 2015? Or should we be thinking about the $25 million approximate increase in -- or annualized increase in expenses that we're seeing right now with this new guidance? Should that be added incrementally to our 2015 estimate? I happen to be estimating $650 million in expenses in 2015. Should I be thinking about that going to $675 million?
Robert Qutub: I think your math is -- falls right in line with ours when you look at the full year outlook? And our stepped-up spending for the rest of the year, whether it's $154 million or $153 million or $155 million.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Right, right.
Robert Qutub: I think the balance of the year. It goes back to what Henry was saying. 2015, yes, we're going to get the annualization of these quarters, and they'll -- so they'll round out to 2015. But there will be some opportunities that we'll evaluate as we go into the remainder of the year and as we look at the balance to 2015. So I can't tell you what they'll be, I can't tell you how much they'll be, but we know the opportunities are out there.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Well, in terms of the timing, what do you need to see from the new investments starting to impact performance before you start spending more, I guess, would be the question. Or is that a gating factor? Because it...
Henry A. Fernandez: Not for sure it's a -- yes. Definitely, it's a gating factor. So if you look at -- so think about it in the final way. Look, in the last 6 to 12 months, we have been putting some investments on our PMA business. With that 2011 to 2013 period, we began to see a very sharp increase in retention rates due to that -- those investments, especially in the client-servicing part, our consultants, our outreach to clients, the -- showing the product roadmap and all that. So that gave us strength to continue putting in more investments in that. And we saw -- we have put investments in the new product development and launched a lot of things last year. But we were waiting to see for all of those to turn into real sales. So we've seen that. We have been -- since October of 2012, with that -- it happened -- what happened then, we've changed radically the way we were looking at the ETF market and stepped-up our dialogue with clients, our dialogue with the ETF managers and the like, and so we've been gradually doing that. So in the last 6 months, we've seen -- 12 months, right, we've seen a huge payoff on that relative to market and relative to other ETF index providers. So was it a time to -- so it has been successful. So it's time to step it up and, particularly, step up the -- for example, our outreach of product management to wealth managers, which is an area that, increasingly, many ETFs are being sold to right now.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes. And then one question, if I may. The LSE's purchase of Russell recently, what does that mean to the competitive environment for you guys? Does it create more opportunity, less opportunity? And does that -- the timing of that tie into the timing of this increase in expenses?
Henry A. Fernandez: First of all, given the valuations, right, it makes us feel pretty good about our assets, in our indices, right? Giving that I'm the largest individual shareholder of MSCI makes me feel pretty good about my shares, right? Secondly, it reinforces the point that I made earlier to George that, increasingly, institutional investors around the globe are looking at one equity world as opposed to a segregated equity world. And obviously, you see an international equity index provider buying a domestic index provider, so that reinforces that. Three, it reinforces our strategy that we're a global equity shop, right? We try not to look at the world in local terms. We're a global equity shop. So it reinforces our position in the marketplace, our strategy in the marketplace and the like, and therefore, it creates enormous opportunities for MSCI to be that one place of choice for people to go to get their global benchmarks in one global integrated equity investment process. So -- now that's not going to happen by us sitting and then waiting to receive the call from clients, right? So, therefore, we have been investing, over the last 3 or 4 years, in this outreach of convincing clients to follow this principle of one equity investment in the world. And therefore, it's time to step up that investment significantly so we can capitalize on the opportunity that is ahead of us and for us to be the major beneficiary of that trend of having one equity world.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey from KBW.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Bob, I just want to follow up. So I appreciate the comment you made about not being focused on margin expansion. But just sort of thinking about the current investment strategy, is there a pathway to getting back to sort of a mid-40% margin rate if you continue to invest like this? Or does it sort of -- at some point, do you sort of see this exhausting? And what kind of timeframe would you be thinking about?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. So for the foreseeable future, we have -- for the foreseeable future, we have refocused our financial metrics that we follow to really focus on high revenue growth, obviously, if we can achieve that, and high profit growth. That's what we have focused on. And in the past, maybe we were too focused on EBITDA margin as a name in itself, and that was fine. It served us well and all of that. But we want to focus on EBITDA margin as a means to an end, and the end is high revenue growth and high levels of profitability over time. For the foreseeable future, we do not see an expansion of our EBITDA margin at all, because we're putting investments in place in order to see an acceleration of sales and obviously the revenues and, eventual, an acceleration of profit -- profits, not profit margin but profits in the company. And therefore, there's a step-up that we need to do upfront in order to achieve that to then see that higher revenue growth and higher profit growth in the future.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly for me, maybe a little different tactic. But -- so in terms of the strong influence you saw during the quarter, how much of that was being driven by interest in emerging markets?
Henry A. Fernandez: There was an uptick in -- I think -- if you think about 2 quarters ago, the percentage of our -- of emerging market -- the percentage of the AUM, of ETF-linked to MSCI in emerging market was 23%, 24%, something like that, it's hovering around 26% today or something to that effect, so definitely seen a little bit of an uptick in that. But we see an upticks all over in our Asian indices. We've seen, clearly, in our European indices. There's been quite a rally in the last couple of years, obviously, in the European markets and the like. So it's a very -- our business is very diversified. So I will not chalk up the great progress we made and the great performance on our ETF at all purely to emerging market. It's been a contributor but not a significant one.
Robert Qutub: We see in a lot of cases, given our global presence in ETF investment, we'll see outflows of developed -- and we'll see outflows from developed market ETFs into emerging markets. That trend will reverse and go from emerging markets into developed markets. We've talked about that last year when we saw an exodus from emerging markets went right into our developed market. So I wouldn't say we're agnostic. I would say that as we get larger in that space, that we see these flows between emerging markets and developed markets, and we don't break those out for disclosures. But as Henry said, 26% of our AUMs are in emerging markets relative to our total.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Henry, in your prepared remarks, I think you said that you want to be in a position to increase asset class coverage in the index business. So can you just flesh out that comment a little bit more?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. I think that is -- a lot of that is factor index investing, right, being able to look at the entire equity opportunity set and being able to understand how the assets underneath the global equity opportunity sets can be re-weighed [ph] or the re-made [ph] in a wide variety of ways to create strategy indices. We call them factory. This is what people call them are smart beta indices or people call them advanced beta indices. So proliferation of names for this. But it is quite a fundamental revolution that is going on in passive investing, to go from investing in market data to basically go on investing strategy data. So we are the leader, currently, of that revolution in terms of index, in providing indices. And we need to ramp that up, not only in the ability to cover the assets, but also in the ability to create the methodologies and back system and show that to our client and then put all of that into a highly scalable production environment. Our production environment is largely built for market data, and now -- and therefore, we -- and have added quite a lot of capacity for factor indices. But we want to make sure that we have the capacity to scale it even higher.
Operator: And we have time for one more question from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Henry, any sense of -- with these incremental investments, we have an incremental step-up in organic growth kind of from the targets we had initially set. And would we expect them to come into the fold quicker? Or is it the same type of step-function in terms of the step-up in organic revenue growth?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes, for sure. I mean, we want to make these investments because we believe that they would increase our revenue growth over and above what we thought a few -- 2 quarters ago and the prior investment plan. The timing of all of this is very similar to the timing of what we talked about in Investor Day and what we talked about it the prior investment plan, right, and that is there are so -- well, we try to do a balance of investment. There are some investments that we put in sales, in client service, in consultant and in product management that have an impact on -- directly on sales in the first 12 months, have an impact on higher retention rates in the first 12, 18 months and the like. And there is a big part of this investment plan that goes in that direction. Then you have the product investments per se. And then by the way, those new sales, new client service, new [indiscernible], that is to service the existing product line in order to sell more of the existing product line and to retain more of the existing product line. Then we put another layer of investment, which is can we create new products, significantly new products. That investment typically takes 2 to 3 years to begin to bear fruit. Look at the example on the PMA part. We've been launching -- we've been investing in products. We launched all the products and all that. So when you look at the whole cycle, it was a 2- to 3-year cycle to begin to see meaningful payoff. That -- it will continue, but I'm saying just initial meaningful payoff in terms of new sales and the like. And then there's a third level of investment, which we try to make it a smaller part, but an important part, which is the investment on the overall technology infrastructure of the organization that is going to position the company to generate additional sales 3, 5 years from now, right? That's kind of the way we look at it. Front-office investment for one to -- 12 to 18 months, product investment for 2 to 3 years and then infrastructure investment for 3 to 5 years.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Understood. And then just, obviously, there's a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet at this point. Any thought in terms of buyback versus acquisition? Has the preference changed at all? Or is it more opportunistic?
Robert Qutub: I think -- well, like I said in my comments, that we're evaluating the potential return of capital, along with acquisitions that may be in front of us, and we'll get back to you. We're in discussions with the board.
Henry A. Fernandez: But in terms of the philosophy that we have established over the last 2 years of return on capital, that has not changed at all. What we have to weigh is, clearly, the ability to do that and, clearly, the big -- all capital -- all excess cash in the balance sheet versus M&A opportunities that present itself. And I don't want to overemphasize the M&A focus of this company, because the vast majority of the focus of this company is organic growth. So I want to go on record continuing to emphasize that. That is what we're focused on. That's what we do everyday and the like. But there are times in which sort of properties that are unique, that are once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-a-generation opportunity that could add significantly to the strategic footprint of the company. And they come to the market, and you're going to look at them. And when you're looking at that, you got to preserve your optionality. And therefore, that's the kind of space we're in right now. But the philosophy of returning excess resources back to the shareholder that we don't need is black-and-white part of our strategy.
Operator: And that is all the time that we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.
Edings Thibault: Well, thank you, Andrew, and thank you, everybody, on the call for your interest in MSCI. We certainly appreciate your ownership and followership, if you will, of MSCI, and we look forward to updating you again at the beginning of October. Have a great morning.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Edings Thibault. Mr. Thibault, you may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you very much. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the first quarter 2014. A copy of that release may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You will also find on our website a slide presentation that we have prepared to accompany this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflects management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs, and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainty that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2013, today's earnings release and our other filings with the SEC. Today's earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: after-tax income from discontinued operations and the amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, while adjusted EPS also excludes the income tax effect of the excluded items. Please refer to today's earnings release and pages 20 through 22 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to our numbers. With that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Edings. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report our strong first quarter results. Our revenues of $240 million are up 9% versus the prior year, and our run rate grew organically by 10%, to $955 million. Our EBITDA slipped a bit by 2%, to $97 million, as we made important strides in executing on our investment plan. Our diluted earnings per share rose 42% as a result of a noncash tax benefit associated with the sale of ISS. Bob will review these numbers later on in the call. Let me take this opportunity to share with you, from my perspective, what I think are the 3 biggest headlines from this quarter. First, the investments we made in 2013 and earlier are continuing to pay dividends. Our subscription run rate growth accelerated to 8% versus 6% in the fourth quarter, for example of those dividends. Importantly, the improvement in the first quarter was driven by both stronger sales and an improved retention rate environment for us, which have been 2 key investment areas for us over the past year. Secondly, we continued to make important strides in our investment program, which we outlined at Investor Day. And therefore, we added a total of 43 employees in the quarter and nearly 400 over the last 12 months. And third, I am pleased to report that this morning we closed on the sale of ISS. The last 2 points, the investment program that we have set for ourselves and the close of ISS, are critical because they reflect our determination to make MSCI a more focused and faster-growing company, one that is well-positioned to take advantage of the big changes that we see in the investment industry worldwide. By investing in our products that create real solutions to our clients' investment programs and distribution so that we're very close to those clients and in servicing them and by shedding non-core units, we believe we can accelerate MSCI's revenue growth into the double digits over the next few years. Our first quarter results represent one important step in that direction. As I noted, our run rate grew by 10% in the first quarter of 2014, fueled by a 14% growth in our overall sales and a continued improvement in our retention rates. Our sales growth was driven by a combination of the investments we have made to add to our sales force and an increase in our product development initiatives. We have grown our sales force by almost 20% over the past year. We have increased our sales focus on ETF providers, a decision that is paying off. In the past, we have talked about our investments in countries like Korea and Canada, and how those investments are generating new sales. This quarter, we opened a new sales offices in Santiago, Chile, to cover clients in the countries of Chile, Peru and Colombia, which have fast-developing pension fund markets for us. Another contributor to our growth was the continued strength in our retention rates. Over the past year, we have made significant investments to strengthen our client service teams. Our key focus has also been on adding to the number of client consultant that support our analytics products. This client consultants are typically located in our major sales offices around the world, and have the day-to-day responsibility for ensuring that our clients get the maximum benefit from our tools. Increasing the quality and the quantity of our interaction with clients increases our retention rates; enables us to meet our clients' needs faster; and serve as a valuable pipeline of ideas for new problems. As we noted during the Investor Day, adding to our new product development capability has been and will continue to be the single biggest part of our investment plan. We want to be relentless in our focus on adding value to our clients and on accelerating new product development is critical to that goal. It is pretty gratifying to see some signs that our focus in these areas are starting to pay dividends in the form of improved operating results for us. One big example of where innovation is driving results is in the equity investment process. Equity investors worldwide are increasingly using quantitative tools to help them drive a desired investment outcome, which has lower volatility or higher dividend income without giving up the benefits of broad market diversification. MSCI's factor indices are used by our clients to help them achieve these goals. Assets under management linked to our factor indices have grown rapidly, expanding from $50 billion a year ago to approximately $95 billion at the end of the first quarter. New mandates won in the quarter added almost $10 billion in new assets, demonstrating the increasing acceptance of MSCI's factor indices and our increasing leadership in this market. One of our key advantages in building factor indices is the credibility that we bring to the market via our Barra factor modeling expertise. We are focusing on extending that leadership in factor investing. In the first quarter, we launched a series of 10 sector factor models for the U.S. market. These models enable investors to take a factor-based approach to market sectors in the United States for the first time. We also launched an emerging market model, a risk model or a factor model to help emerging market investors. All of these 11 new models incorporate our new and innovative methodology, which we call systematic equity strategies. Looking ahead, we anticipate a new release shortly of Barra Portfolio Manager that will significantly expand our ability to process large equity portfolios and extend the backtesting capability of some of our key risk models. In the multi-asset class investment process, we continue to benefit from the growing demand for greater exposure to alternative asset classes, among our asset-owner clients. During the first quarter, 2 large U.S.-based pension plan turned to MSCI to provide risk management and reporting systems because of our market leadership and our coverage of both liquid asset classes and alternative asset classes. We also made progress in deepening our relationship with pension fund consultants by leveraging the InvestorForce platform that we acquired a year ago. One of our key growth strategies is to reinforce that network effect or ecosystem effect that we can derive from the widespread use of our tools and methodologies by both asset owners and asset managers. So it's gratifying to see our continued progress on this front. Many of our large multi-asset class investment clients are placing increasing demands on our portfolio processing capabilities as they seek to bring more positions and more portfolios into our risk management and reporting technology platform. One of the largest deals for the first quarter was to a global asset manager who needed to upgrade their current usage to incorporate many more portfolios and cover a much wider set of securities in a much faster environment. Therefore, increasing the capabilities of our technology platforms is a key investment objective of ours, including expanding our data centers, expanding our use of virtualization technologies and storage capabilities. Through the second quarter, we will be releasing an upgrade to BarraOne, which will provide enhanced visualization capabilities in that software system and improve asset liability management capabilities, among other changes. We're also targeting a significant upgrade in our ability to process data around complex securities with lower latency in the second half of this year. We continued to make progress on our targeted investment plan during the first quarter. As all of you know, investments for us is really adding skilled people that develop and enhance our intellectual property. Our net headcount increased by 43 versus the quarter -- the fourth quarter of last year, and by almost 400 people versus the first quarter of 2013, which is an evidence of the investment program that we have set for ourselves. And approximately 50% of the first quarter additions of personnel were in our product development efforts, 1/3 came in client service and the remaining 15% were additions to our corporate infrastructure. Most of the new additions of personnel that we made over the last year have been in our emerging market centers, reflecting our focus on maximizing the efficiency of our investment dollars. Finally, as I said earlier, we closed the sale of ISS this morning. With the sale, MSCI is now even more focused on its primary goal of offering a full range of tools that offer insight to our clients on the risk and the performance of their portfolios in the major single-asset classes of the world and the combination of all of them for our multi-asset class investment portfolio -- investment clients. So let me sum up my remarks. First, we had a very solid start to 2014. The investments that we have made in sales, client service and product development, including our technology platform, have contributed to an increase in our overall sales and continued to drive higher and higher retention rates. Secondly, we are on track to continue that investment plan. We continue to push forward in our hiring plans, and I am pleased with the pace of our product development efforts. It is early, but we believe that we're also on track to increase our revenue growth to the double-digit goal that we have set for ourselves for the next few years. Third, and finally, with the sale of ISS, MSCI is a much more focused company with additional flexibility to accelerate our organic growth and our return of capital to shareholders. Bob?
Robert Qutub: Thank you, Henry. Before I get into the details of our results, let me point out some important changes that we have made in our financial reporting. The biggest change is that the results of our Governance business have been reclassified as discontinued operations in all periods. Our numbers reflect the operating segment previously reported as Performance and Risk plus some shared overhead expenses that have been reported as part of the Governance segment. Most of my commentary, unless otherwise noted, is going to be directed at the results of our continuing operations. I would also encourage you to look at Slide 16 through 19 of our presentation, where we've made available our 2013 full year and quarterly results in the new reporting format. We also consolidated reporting revenue and operating metrics of our energy and commodity analytics product line with that of our risk management analytics product line. RMA results have been restated for all periods to reflect this change. With that clear, let's go into the financial headlines from the first quarter 2014. Revenues grew 9% to $240 million. Net income from continuing operations declined 11% to $47 million, and diluted EPS from continuing operations fell by 7%, with adjusted EBITDA falling 2% and adjusted EPS falling 8% to $0.46 per share. We had a strong first quarter on an operating basis. Run rate grew by 9.5% to $955 million. This was driven by a growth in asset-based fee run rate and a 7.5% organic growth in subscription run rate. Retention rates remained strong. We continued to make progress in executing on our investment plan. Our adjusted EBITDA expense rose by 18% to $143 million, in line with our investment plan and the expectations we laid out last month in our Investor Day. We closed the sale of ISS this morning for $367 million, plus or minus some customary working capital adjustments. As part of the February 2014 ASR, we acquired 1.7 million shares of MSCI's stock. Now let's dig into the numbers. Revenues grew, as I said, by 9% to $240 million. The biggest driver of revenue growth was our subscription revenues, which grew by 8.5%. Asset-based fees rose 12% and nonrecurring revenues rose by $0.5 million. By product, index and ESG product revenues rose 14%. Risk management analytics revenues rose by 7% and portfolio management analytics revenues declined by 6%. On a run rate basis, our total subscription business grew by 7.5% to $793 million. Subscription run rate growth was comprised of an 11% increase in index and ESG subscriptions and 7% growth in RMA, partially offset by a 2% decline in PMA. Subscription sales rose 18% to $30 million, and MSCI's retention rate edged up 40 basis points to nearly 93%, with all products showing retention rates greater than 90%. Changes in foreign currency rates had a positive impact on run rate of $5.5 million year-over-year. The sequential impact was only a positive $600,000. Now let's turn to the performance of each of our 3 major product groups, starting with our index and ESG products, where revenues grew by $17 million or 14%. Index and ESG revenue growth was aided by the timing of revenue recognition related to IPD products, which contributed $5.2 million to our growth. Index and ESG subscription run rate grew by 11% to $382 million, led by equity index and data products. And with strong growth in ESG and IPD products, which on a combined basis, grew nearly 19% as we saw strong demand for ESG products and IPD real estate data. Index and ESG sales rose 14%, and retention rates remained strong at 95%. Changes in foreign currency lifted our run rate by $3 million year-over-year and had only a modest positive impact sequentially. Asset-based fee revenues rose by 12% to $41 million. Asset-based fee run rate rose 21% to $162 million, with assets under management ETFs linked to MSCI indices at the end of the first quarter declining 5% to $341 billion. First quarter 2014, though, was the quarter in which Vanguard began its transition of the ETFs that switched indices, so that we should start to see increasing convergence between the annual growth of asset-based fees -- asset-based revenue, run rate and the changes in assets under management over the next 2 quarters. Excluding the impact of the Vanguard transition, asset-based fees grew 20% and assets under management grew by $55 billion or 19%. Of that increase, inflows into MSCI-linked ETFs accounted for $37 billion or 2/3 of the change. Market appreciation accounted for only $18 billion. That pattern continued during the first quarter of 2014, as assets under management increased by $8 billion during the quarter, with $7 billion of that coming from inflows. It's also worth highlighting the diversity of AUM linked to our indices. Less than a quarter of the AUM in those ETFs are linked to our emerging market indices. More than 50% are tied to our non-U.S. developed market indices and our results are driven by a wide range of ETFs. Of the 667 ETFs linked to our indices, 62 have AUMs north of $1 billion. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, RMA now includes results from our energy and commodity analytics products. Risk management analytics revenues rose by 7% year-over-year, and run rate also rose 7% to $307 million. Growth in the Americas and in Asia more than offset continued weakness in Europe. Retention rates in the quarter dipped but remained strong above 90%. FX changes lifted our run rate by $3.5 million over last year, but had very little impact sequentially. Moving on to PMA. Revenues fell 6% to $26 million and run rate fell 2% to $104 million. Big story in PMA was the very modest sequential increase in run rate versus the fourth quarter of 2013. And as Henry noted, we launched 11 new models in the first quarter. New products have yet to have a major impact on our overall sales figure but they are playing a part in our stronger retention rate, with retention rates rebounding sharply to 91% from 82% in the same period last year. FX changes contributed very modestly to the sequential growth but remained at $1 million headwind on a year-over-year basis. Now let's turn to expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA expense rose by 18% to $143 million. As we expected, the biggest increase in our expense resulted from our investments in product development, followed by sales and marketing. Total compensation expense rose 14% to $102 million. Growth in compensation expense was driven by the 17% increase in our headcount to 2,623. We worked hard to mitigate the impact of these additions by making most of the additions in lower-cost centers, some of that benefit was muted by the senior additions we have made to build out our leadership team. Non-compensation expense, which excludes depreciation and amortization, rose 31% first quarter -- versus first quarter 2013, as we strengthened our technology infrastructure and added to our overall footprint. Increases in other items such as professional services, market data and marketing expenses also contributed to the increase. Much of these expenses came online over the course of 2013 and our non-compensation expenses were more stable versus the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of the higher cost, adjusted EBITDA declined by 2% to $97 million and income from continuing operations fell 11%, as our tax rate was more normalized at 36% in the first quarter 2014 versus 29% a year ago. And before we turn to our balance sheet and cash flow, let me touch very quickly on our income from discontinued operations. We recorded income from discontinued operations of $33 million versus $6 million a year ago. First quarter 2014 results include a $31 million noncash tax benefit associated with our decision to sell ISS, which we completed this morning. The tax benefit will reverse in the second quarter, and we estimate this to have a product gain of approximately $75 million to be recorded from the sale. And I want to emphasize that we expect to incur no cash tax liability on the sale of ISS. Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the first quarter 2014 with total debt of $803 million with a total cash position of $260 million, of which, $61 million is held offshore. During the quarter, MSCI generated operating cash flow of $25 million. We spent $10 million in capital expenditures, repaid $5 million of debt and spent $100 million in February for the accelerated share repurchase program. As part of the February ASR, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares, that brings the total number of shares we have purchased as part of our December 2012 $300 million repurchased authorization to 7.1 million shares. We expect to receive additional shares in May at the conclusion of the February ASR. Share repurchase activity contributed to a 2.6% decline in the number of diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter. Now before I conclude, let me review our current financial guidance for 2014. We expect our adjusted EBITDA expenses to be in the range of $569 million to $582 million. We also expect our cash flow from operations to remain in the range of $275 million to $325 million. Capital expenditures continue to be projected at $45 million to $55 million, with capital spending picking up in the second and third quarter, as we make additional investments in our technology infrastructure and server capacity. And finally, our full year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 36%, which excludes the impact of the R&D tax credit that has not been renewed. Now with that, I think we're ready to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just maybe starting on the RMA business, risk management business, I think the one thing, Bob, you weren't talking about, is the retention rate coming down, year-over-year? I think you mentioned it, but I think you didn't give an explanation. So maybe you can just flesh it out a little bit. Is this coming from a competitive front? Are you seeing any changes there? Or what's driving that lower?
Robert Qutub: Nothing significant to point out. We had a couple of cancellations, but I still want to emphasize that a 91% retention rate at RMA is a very strong retention rate for that business.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, that's fair enough. And then, I mean, maybe just secondly on the expenses. If you look at that new chart that you gave us here and the employee growth, looks like the first quarter slowed down a little bit the pace of 2013. So maybe just talk a little bit in terms of where you are in your spending and hiring plans, as we think about the remainder of the year. I think if I look at your total expense guidance, I think you're kind of tracking at the lower end. So maybe just flesh it out a little bit where the incremental additions are coming in and where you are today.
Robert Qutub: As Henry outlined, we had 43 -- a net increase of 43 coming in, of which half of them are for our product development, which is very consistent with our investment spend, and a 1/3 coming in coverage and 15% in infrastructure. We still feel on pace. As you know, January and February tend to be a little bit slower in terms of getting people into seats. But our online offer acceptance rates are coming in strong, we feel good and we still have very focused view on where our investments dollars are being spent.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You've -- just another question on the comp. You mentioned hiring some senior people this quarter that led to the offset in the comp line from moving employees to emerging markets. Is there going -- a couple questions. One, is there going to be a mix change going forward with hiring more in developed markets than emerging? And -- based on your investment plan. And then, two, any additional senior people you're expecting, like any vacancies that you're expecting in the senior levels?
Henry A. Fernandez: Toni, the -- we continue to be very focused on the growth of our employee, i.e. our investment plan in our call centers. So that is -- continues and is relentless. What we have found, especially in technology, the technology group, is that we have struggled to find very senior, highly skilled global operators in technology in some of the lower-cost centers that we're operating. So we have shifted a bit the focus on hiring those people in developed markets. And so in the last, for example, in the last few couple of weeks -- couple of months, I should say, we've hired 4 Managing Directors in our technology group. And 3 were, I mean, Managing Directors here in New York and 1 Managing Director in Mumbai.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just on ISS and the proceeds that you're going to be getting from the closing of the sale today. How -- you've talked a little bit about what you're expecting in terms of deploying the proceeds in terms of investing in the business and potential acquisitions or returning through buybacks. Just how quickly do you think that you would be able to deploy the proceeds? Or is this more of a very long-term process?
Robert Qutub: The proceeds, we are -- we remain, as Henry said and I said, very, very focused, and as you acknowledged, on our organic investments, and that's where our eyes are. We're still in the ASR right now. We're evaluating our options with the proceeds, as they have just cleared the bank accounts. So I would say more to follow on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos from Crédit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Henry, maybe sort of a high-level question. I'm just wondering how much of your success in accelerating sales you attribute to better execution at MSCI versus what up until recently was an improving environment in the financial services space. And just curious if you're seeing any sort of change in client tone over the past month or so, as we've had a bit more of a choppier market?
Henry A. Fernandez: Just elaborating a little bit on the dialogue that we have had with all of you with respect to the operating environment, I think the change that you have seen over the last, now, say 3 quarters or so, 2, 3 quarters, is an environment in which the clients are more receptive to dialogue, to ideas, to concepts, to discussions and the like; but they're not on an environment in which they're free to spend on what they want. So therefore, the strategy that we have been following is to see how we can capitalize on that receptivity by being a catalyst for fulfilling some of their needs. And the catalyst, typically, is in the form of a new product or an enhanced product, in the form of our consultants navigating through inside the organization and identifying new needs. And then we come back with a solution to those needs. And it's also -- the catalyst is also the ability of us to cover more clients or deeper into the current client organizations that we follow and, therefore, the additional sales and the like. So there is receptivity but it's not proactively on the part of clients. We need to go out and get it. We need to be a catalyst for that. So I would attribute a large part of our success in the last couple quarters in increasing the sales tempo. And now, for a good number of quarters, in high, very high retention rates, attributed much more to what we have done, much more to our ability to navigate those client organizations and be catalysts, as opposed to the operating environment just coming [ph] at all, so just giving us the sales. And your last comment is, we are -- we don't have an indicator that is kind of week-to-week or month-to-month with respect to our clients. So we haven't really seen much change on the choppy markets over the last few weeks, or haven't seen much change on -- in Europe [ph], for example, the geopolitical situation there. So there haven't been any items that have been taken out of the pipeline because of that, or slowed down in the pipeline because of that. So we haven't seen any effect of any of that.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe, Bob, just digging in a little bit on the RMA. I'm just curious if -- the lower retention, is that predominantly just sourced from the hedge fund side of the business? And then maybe talk a little bit about the rationale of combining the RMA in the energy business.
Robert Qutub: I'll start with the second one. It just made logical sense to combine that within the RMA, given the multi-asset class nature of that business, that product line. So that was intuitive, something we'd talked about a while ago, and we felt the first quarter was the time to roll that out. I can't say there's really anything unusual in the retention rate in terms of it, other than the fact that we feel very good it's at 91% and our client service. I would say we're not losing clients, though, George, I just want to make sure that these are some modest potential down-sells that occur. We've seen a net growth in our net client base over the quarter, year-over-year and linked quarter, so there's nothing really -- there's no headlines to attach to it.
Henry A. Fernandez: Now with that, George, on energy and commodity analytics, this has been a business that has as you -- small line item but has been impacted for a couple of years now. Because a lot of what we did there was the creation of auction [ph] models that were coupled with software to help people in energy and commodity markets hedge their exposure to electricity or natural gas or things like that. And that was highly dependent on the OTC market for companies, corporates and dealing with obviously broker-dealers and the like. And given the high levels of uncertainty that have existed in that market by the regulators, to move it to a centrally cleared [ph] market, exchange-credit market, that has been a painful process for that business. So what we're now trying to do is reposition that business into more of the mainstream of risk management for our clients, which would include commodities and energy markets. We have a project, internally, which is called FEA 2.0, which is a little bit of taking a lot of the capabilities of FEA and putting them in RiskManager, the risk metrics product line, and having a wider use case for that and all those capabilities in that business.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: I wondered if you could give us a sense to just -- as clients are working their way through their budgets, Henry, are they looking to firm them up mid-year or kind of keep them more static? Or just thoughts on the budget process, given that we're kind of a quarter of the way through the year at this point.
Henry A. Fernandez: Kevin, yes, I mean we were coming off last year and into this year, like the nature of your question, we were kind of wondering how clients were going to budget for their needs in 2014. And given the tough environment for the last few years, we were fearful that, on a straight budgetary process, that clients were going to keep a tight lid into their formal budgets going into 2014. That hasn't happened. They -- we're not in a spending spree kind of environment at all. I think a lot of clients have built flexible budgetary processes in which whatever they -- their basic and most important needs are being addressed versus, let's say, a year ago, in which even their basic needs were being postponed. But what I said before is the absolutely key to this process for us is be a catalyst in that process, so that -- as a catalyst that there is a need, we hit the need, we present with the product, a new product or an enhanced product, and it forces them to go out through the chain of approvals to get that done, and then we get the sale done. Being a catalyst in that process is usually important, and that is why we formed, clearly, this investment program because we felt that, probably in 2014 and maybe even 2015, your success in driving sales and high retention rates, it will be dependent upon being that catalyst. That typically is a new product, an enhanced product, a new functionality, something new to talk about and so on and so forth, right? The other part of this thing is that regulations are tightening and a lot of the regulatory environment that has been discussed extensively over the last 3 or 4 years is now -- a little bit in 2013, and clearly in 2014 is now coming into -- coming online for a lot of clients. Before, it was a question of consultations and debate and discussion. Well, the reality of that new regulatory environment is now coming online and, therefore, you have deadlines of fulfillment of those regulatory requirements by a lot of financial institutions, and we're capitalizing on that trend as well.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Understood. And then just is there any sense, Henry, as you make the investment in the sales force, would you expect some type of kind of -- I know there's going to be a transition period, and as they scale, part of that to drive the continued accelerating into kind of '15? So you hired them today, maybe they take, is it a 6- to 12-month window before they scale and then they ultimately execute that much better, or...? Am I thinking about that right?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes, I think there are 2 drivers, if I get the nature of your question, Kevin, there are 2 drivers that we are looking to benefit from. One is, clearly, it takes time, some products more than others, for those salespeople to become completely functional and producing at maximum levels. In the equity index business it's a shorter fuse, say, 3 months or so, maybe a little longer. At the other end, risk management analytics, it probably takes 6 to 12 months for salespeople to get more up to speed. So that 20% addition of personnel in the sales force is still going through those step functions of improving efficiency and productivity. So we should get the benefit of that as they become more up to speed with the product line. So that's one benefit that we hope to reap. The second benefit is that we are still in an environment in which the ticket items are on the lower end of what we're used to. So, therefore, a PMA sale is maybe $50,000 to $100,000, when they used to be maybe a couple of hundred thousand. An RMA sale, maybe, is $300,000 to $500,000, when they used to be almost $1 million. So the ticket size has decreased because people are being extremely more focused on reducing the -- just buying the functionality that they need. So therefore, our productivity per salesperson over the last few years has been in the low end of what is possible. So what we are also counting on as the recovery unfolds and gets better and better in the next 1 to 3 years is that, that size of a sales force that we have could have higher levels of productivity per salesperson because the ticket items are bigger, the sales cycle gets shorter as things improve. And therefore you get a lot of benefit from that, but we're not there yet. We're gradually seeing it, but we're not there yet. But that could be a significant dividend for us 1 or 2 years from now, right? Depending on, obviously, how fast the recovery in the budgets of our clients takes place in the next couple of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey from KBW.
Michael Needham - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: This is Mike Needham sitting in for Joel. I'm just curious, thanks for giving detail on some of the factor models that you guys put out this year. But is there really a clear second group of products where you're seeing the most demand for -- increasing demand from clients outside of factor indices? Or is most of the new product developments specifically in that area?
Henry A. Fernandez: Look, I think the -- there continues to be a lot of demand, and I don't want to minimize this, because the bulk of our sales are coming from our existing product line and enhanced product line of market data indices, right? So there continues to be -- there's been a lot of demand from that. And the bulk of our sales are in that category, so the developed market module, the emerging market module. The frontier market added into the emerging market module. So for example, 2013 was a real banner year for the performance of frontier markets, much better than emerging markets. So that frontier market data set and indices are embedded in the emerging market module. So we did well in emerging market data module sales because of the frontier markets, for example, right? So that continues. Clearly, with the continued changes that we made in our index methodology to adjust to the changes in the marketplace, such as the addition of Qatar and UAE and things like that, the consultation we're doing on China now currently and the like, that creates also demand for the market cap indices. They are -- the majority of our licensing activity for ETFs and other forms of index funds and the like, continues to be the market capitalization indices. So that's important to note. Now a lot of the new product development, but not a lot yet of the bulk of the new sales are coming from factor investing and the like. And therefore, we end up talking a lot more about it, because that's the thing that we're focusing on to generate a new generation of products and build on the sales of the market cap indices. And they started with income producing indices some time ago, then it went to minimum volatility indices. Now, we're talking about quality indices and multi-factor indices of one form or another, quality mix and things like that. And therefore, there is a lot of demand that is going in that direction. And a lot of activity in our product development team. But again, the major focus of our activities on our sales force has been the market cap indices and the majority of our sales. So all we're trying to do is respond to the market needs for a lot of factor investing and create an even more diversified index business and equity analytics business than we've had before.
Michael Needham - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Got it. And just on ETF inflows, they came in a little bit lighter in the first quarter, but it looks like, overall, international fund flows continue to be pretty good. Do you think that's just some noise in the first quarter or should we read more into that?
Henry A. Fernandez: No, it's just noise. We have been extremely pleased with the performance of the ETFs that are linked to MSCI indices in the first quarter. If you look at the global equity index fund, equity ETFs, if you look at the data of inflows, we captured something like 40% of inflows of the total market. So a couple of things are happening. One, we're launching a lot of new products every quarter, all over the world. Secondly, we're capturing a higher market share of the inflows of money going into these ETFs than our average market share, so that puts us in a position to increase market share. And we're fairly diversified, so when the emerging market, which is about a quarter, a little less than a quarter of our total AUM in ETF, when the emerging markets are struggling, the money flows to developed markets, to Europe, in Asia places like Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the like. And then to the U.S., which -- where we have a smaller presence in the U.S., on U.S. equity ETFs, but an important one, nonetheless. So I think it's noise. And -- but this franchise is incredible, it's just enormous. And we're growing it every day, we're launching a lot of new products, the dialogue with our ETF clients -- my manager clients is incredible all over the world. We -- I could not say better things about the ETF franchise that we built.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So a question for you on free cash flow conversion. Without ISS in the picture anymore, what do we expect the free cash flow from EBITDA to be? Back in 2013 it was running about 62%.
Robert Qutub: I think that we provided you our operating cash flow. We look at it, we're gauging it between $275 million this year and $325 million, so that gives you the volume that we're looking at from operating cash flow before capital expenditures and any other equity distributions. Our EBITDA margin is around 40% that we convert from revenues. You can look at it from that perspective, Bill. I mean, those are the data points that we put out there for you. But we still -- high cash flow environment, high cash flow generation, we're very much out in front. A little bit lower in the first quarter, higher compensation expenses, a few things come through. Our outlook, again, we still remain confident in $275 million to $325 million for the full year.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I wanted to ask whether you're seeing a pickup in new cross-border institutional mandates, and if so, from where?
Henry A. Fernandez: No. That is definitely the wave, the current and the middle -- the midterm and the future, right? It's one world. And I think a lot of institutions, especially in the U.S., that used to sort of segregate their equity investment into domestic equities on one hand, on the other hand, developed market equities, and thirdly on emerging market equities. And the ones that were investing in small cap had a fourth leg. Many of those institutions are looking at the equity world as one world, and then they overlay a domestic bias to that. So our ACWI strategy, as we call it, All Country World Index strategy, continuous unabated. So we didn't mention too much in this earnings call about that, but the rate of conversion of institutional investors in the U.S., especially, but also in other places so that ACWI world and ACWI format continues at the same pace that was happening in the last quarter. So we're very pleased with that. And if anything, we're planning to add more resources, a handful of salespeople and research people that meet with clients to accelerate that conversion process.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. A couple of housekeeping items. If I wanted to do an apples-to-apples EPS number that includes ISS, was the accounting [ph] [indiscernible] for ISS about $0.02 to $0.03, is that what I'm getting from the footnotes? The sort of $0.48 to $0.49 number?
Robert Qutub: That's kind of a difficult question to answer, given now where we're showing a discontinued operations. We're really...
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Right. Well that's why I'm just trying to see if -- I'm trying to do a calculation to say, all right, if we -- if they hadn't been reclassified, apples-to-apples, what would it have been? I know it's a...
Robert Qutub: I'm not sure of the relevance of that calculation, Bill, to be honest. ISS is out of our numbers and will be restated -- and is being restated from a retrospective basis. Continuing the full operation EPS, $0.68, $30 million of that was a gain -- a deferred tax gain. So I would encourage you to really focus on the continuing operations, the EPS and as we show it in our formats there.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just confirming the net proceeds on the sale were -- was it -- it didn't sound like there were a lot of deductions to it, around $360 million?
Robert Qutub: We disclosed gross proceeds of $367 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I know that, Henry, I think you talked about in your prepared remarks, you're going to release a new version of BPM soon, which will, I think you said, enhance the -- your ability to process large equity portfolios and help with backtesting. Is that something that I should view as a potential sales driver? Or is it more just kind of normal course of business improvement to the platform and, therefore, maybe more retention mechanism?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think it's both. It's both, but with a much higher emphasis on the sales driver. So let me take a step back here to explain. Clearly, a lot of our level of innovation over the years on the risk modeling side has been okay. And clearly, in the last 2 years, we've stepped it up dramatically, and that's why you've seen the release of so many risk models. Our innovation on the technology front for a number of years going back to the mid-2000s was slow and therefore, clients were relying mostly on Aegis, which is a client-deployed solution, to look at these models. Or we would sell them the data directly and they would look at their model. So we started -- they would build their own software with our data. So we started a third front, which was can we offer a lot of this in third-party systems like FactSet and that has been a good driver of growth as well. So -- but what we've done in the last 2, 3 years, is really accelerate the investment in the new software, Barra Portfolio Manager, which eventually becomes a substitute for Aegis, but is much more than that. It is not just for the clients that use Aegis, but it's a lot easier to use. It has a lot of uses in the fundamental portfolio management process, in addition to the quantitative portfolio management process. So we are definitely selling at a good clip BPM subscriptions, and we're hoping to accelerate that in the next 1 or 2 years, as we are completing the investment plan on BPM. We're probably about 1 year away from having a complete investment plan, and after that it's enhancements more regularly. But we're very close to the end of that process, and therefore, the functionality that exists there is going to help us drive sales on a higher clip.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: All right. Great. And then just one other one unrelated. The $15 million to $18 million of stranded costs which you outlined at the Investor Day. How should we think about that playing into your thought process when it comes to acquisitions?
Robert Qutub: What the $15 million to $18 million gives us -- and it's a little bit tighter than that now -- but still, what that gives us is, for example, we have space here in New York. We vacated, say, 15,000 square feet that we do not need to acquire new space. A similar situation that we have in London, as well as in other offices where we shared space with the ISS team. So that tells us marginal increase, we have that capacity to expand our data centers. That capacity will be removed out of the data centers that we used with ISS, and that will give us room to grow into as part of our investment process. So those stranded costs will be absorbed over time. And all the while, while they're still being utilized to a certain extent by ISS, we have TSA agreements that compensate us for that utilization. So it gives us capacity to grow, it gives us capacity to expand, but nevertheless, they don't go away, but it just slows down the rate of investment as we absorb them.
Henry A. Fernandez: And to the extent we do smaller acquisitions, the space gets filled out faster, and they will relinquish this space of where the acquired companies were located. But you have to do good acquisitions to do that right.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Joe Foresi from Janney Capital Markets.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: We talked a little bit at the Analyst Day about the products and customization of the ETFs as being potential drivers of growth going forward. I wonder if we could get an update on just sort of how you view those as you try to accelerate revenues.
Henry A. Fernandez: Are you saying product customization?
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: The products are one piece of it, the new products which you've been rolling out. And then customization of ETFs, how do they fit into your growth plans?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. I mean, the majority, I would even say the vast majority of our efforts in new product development is to create products that are off-the-shelf, so to speak, and can be used by a wide variety of clients. Only on a very selective basis do we try to go into the business of customizing a product for a particular client. And the reason is that, we put a lot of our effort into the product, there's only 1 client or 2, as opposed to you put a lot of -- the same effort on another product and you have 100, 200 clients, right? So we like leverage in building revenues and that's why we have -- we follow that philosophy. Others are much more on the customization business, but it's very hard to scale the company on the basis of that. Now, we have made exceptions. I mean there was a client of ours who came last year on this sector risk models, and we worked with them and we created some sector models for them and then we took that work, and made it more general and that was the genesis of this 10 sector models that we launched in the U.S. So we want to do a lot more of that. Now, with respect to ETF, again, it's not an issue of customizing an index for a particular ETF, what we do is try to create an index that can be -- that is an investment thesis that transcends cycles and markets and, therefore, could be the basis of an ETF, but the same index can be the basis of an institutionally passive product or a retail -- index mutual fund or an actively managed mandate or whatever. So occasionally, we make customized, but it's the high exception, a particular index or a particular ETF that is very customized, but that's not the vast majority of the business we want to do.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to speakers for closing remarks.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, operator. And to all of our fellow shareholders, we thank you for your ownership and support. And to all others, thanks for your interest in MSCI. Have a great afternoon.

Please refer to today's earnings release in Pages 17 through 20 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. Let me now turn the call over to Henry Fernandez to go ahead and get started, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Edings, and good morning, everyone. Before Bob gives you the details of our fourth quarter results, I would like to take this opportunity to share some of my thoughts with you on the full-year 2013 and what we plan to do in 2014. 2013 was a milestone year for MSCI. We reported strong financial and operating results. And we've made very important strides to strengthening our major product lines. MSCI's revenues grew 9% to more than $1 billion. Our diluted EPS grew by 24%, and our adjusted EPS grew 11% to $2.16. From an operating perspective, a combination of new products, more salespeople, more focused client service and a modest improvement in our operating environment lifted our sales and retention rates. Our run rate grew 9% to $1 billion and -- $1,050,000,000, including 25% growth in asset-based fees, and our retention rate was a very strong 91%. In our Index business in 2013, ETF providers launched a total of 62 new ETFs linked to our indices, including ETFs from 5 new providers. In the fourth quarter alone, ETF providers launched 30 ETFs linked to our indices, including 10 ETFs from Fidelity Investments that are linked to our U.S. domestic indices. Part of our growth in ETFs resulted from the increasing licensing of our Factor Indices. We have talked about this before. Active and passive assets under management worldwide linked to our Factor Indices grew by more than 60% to just over USD 70 billion in 2013. And we won sizable mandates from pension from clients in Asia, in Europe and in Canada. In our Risk Management Analytics business in 2013, we expanded our coverage of market risk to include liquidity risks and counterparty exposures and expanded the functionality of RiskManager and BarraOne. This enhancement and the acquisition of InvestorForce helped grew our client base by 9% during the year while simultaneously increasing our run rate per client. We also put in place dedicated product management and sales heads in Asia-Pacific, which helped grow our run rate in the region by 12%. We also maintained the pace of innovation in the fourth quarter in our Risk Management Analytics business, releasing a new commercial real estate model for BarraOne that grows extensively on the IPD database. One of the benefits we identified when we acquired IPD was that we could tap into their proprietary databases for our risk models, so it is great to see that benefit being realized now. In our Portfolio Management Analytics business in 2013, we launched 7 new market risk models, including 4 in the fourth quarter, as we continue to pick up the pace of new model launches. We also added important new functionality to Barra Portfolio Manager, including enhanced back testing, high-volume reporting and access to the MSCI fundamental ratio data and to the MSCI -- to the new MSCI Economic Exposure Indices. In 2013, we also integrated 2 acquisitions, IPD, as you know, a global leader in commercial real estate performance measurement and attribution, and InvestorForce, a leading provider of performance measurement tools to the U.S. pension fund consultant industry. On the topic of capital efficiency, MSCI returned $200 million of capital to our shareholders since December 2012. Today, we announced our third $100 million ASR agreement, now fully utilizing the $300 million repurchase authorization granted by our board only 13 months ago. MSCI's board also authorized the repurchase of an additional $300 million of our shares. Finally, we continue to explore strategic alternatives for our Governance business, and we look forward to updating you when we have completed that process. Now looking forward to 2014, our attention is focused squarely on ensuring that MSCI continues to lead in providing investment decision tools worldwide. As our clients' budgets begin to recover from the financial crisis, their demand for our tools will grow. The institutional investment marketplace is also changing, presenting us with significant opportunities that we are eager to take on. So what are some of these changes that we see? We see asset owners and their managers more focused on developing products designed to meet a desired investment outcome, for example, reducing volatilities in their portfolios or enhancing income. In addition, we see the rise of ETFs and the acceleration of that rise in the long-term trends towards passive investments and which has also slowed the growth of new active fund creation. Similarly, many institutional investors and their asset managers are looking for a more integrated view of risk and return all developed in the same data and technology platform and, therefore, driving the need for tools that can aid in that process and can also connect the front office of portfolio management with the middle office of risk management all across multiple asset classes. And of course, we cannot talk about changes in the investment landscape without talking about regulation in the financial industry, which is driving demand for more transparency and more reporting of the attribution of investment performance and the sources of portfolio risk. When you take all of this into account, these are, therefore, very exciting times at MSCI. To take advantage of all these changes and to continue to meet our client needs, we have put in motion an investment program that gained traction over the second half of 2013 and will continue well into 2014. Those of you that know us very well understand that for us -- or to us, investment is really primarily investing in people. So let me give you some examples of where we have made some of these investments in 2013. First, sales and distribution. We have strengthened significantly our sales teams worldwide. We added more than 40 new salespeople to our performance and risk sales teams during the year. We opened up new offices, and we deepened our sales focus in every major region of the world. In the Americas, for example, we increased our focus on hedge funds, on smaller loan-only asset managers and on insurance companies, a new segment for us. We also targeted design contribution managers and we strengthened our sales presence in Canada. That dedicated sales presence in Canada paid off very well during the year as we grew our sales of index products in the country by 65%, and our overall run rate there from all products increased by 10%. In EMEA, we expanded our coverage of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and India. We also increased our focus on asset owners in Continental Europe and the U.K., and we grew our index sales teams across the whole region. In Asia, we added to our teams in Shanghai and in Beijing in order to take advantage of the increasing levels and accelerated levels of liberalization of portfolio investment in the Chinese market. We opened a new sales office in Taipei, Taiwan, and we continue to build our presence in Korea. I am pleased to note that Korea has developed into a strong market for MSCI, as we now provide our services to many of the largest Korean asset managers and grew our run rate in the country by more than 20% during the year. A second area of investment for us was client service. Our client service teams play a critical role in helping our clients get the full value of our tools and, therefore, enabling them to make smarter decisions about their portfolios. They also play a critical tool in ensuring that those clients remain with MSCI for many years to come. Over the past 2 years, we have expanded our client service teams worldwide by more than 20% -- sorry, more than 10%, with the addition of these teams in both emerging market centers as well as developed markets centers. These efforts in client service had paid off in the form of very strong retention rates. Our aggregate retention rates for the Performance and Risk segment rose to the highest level since the RiskMetrics merger back in 2010, including a record-high retention rate in Risk Management Analytics, where a great deal of our client service investments have been focused. Third, let me talk a little bit about marketing. In 2013, we stepped up at our marketing to the U.S. financial advisory community via a series of advertising online and in select print publications. These efforts to raise MSCI's index business profile in the U.S. financial advisory community has been very positively received by our ETF providers who license our indices. As we had reported back in October, we hired our first Chief Marketing Officer, and she's well on her way to expanding our marketing efforts into 2014. Fourthly, let me talk about new-product development. We expanded our product development teams by 25% over the course of the year, with a special focus on product managers and application development to write new software and data management to create new data sets. These investments contributed to the launch of a lot of different products but especially the groundbreaking products such as Factor Indices, the new partnership that we have with Barclays on ESG Fixed Income Indices, as well as the introduction of the suite of the new U.S. sector and small-cap risk models that I referred to before. MSCI also rolled out important upgrades to our existing software platforms, with critical additions to RiskManager, BarraOne, hedge platform and wealth bench. Our new products and the enhanced platforms in which they operate are contributing to our growth in sales and are playing a critical role in our strong retention rates. Fifth and last, we also have scaled up our technology infrastructure and our physical footprint in order to support these investments. Bob will make some comments about those investments in his remarks. We expect our investment program to lift our revenue growth rates from the mid to high single digits currently to the low double digits over the course of the next few years. Some of our investments, like those in sales, client service and marketing, should bring benefits soon, over the course of 2014 and 2015. Others, including our new product development efforts, may take a little longer. But we feel very confident that these targeted investments will bode well for MSCI and our shareholders. As we plan to invest steadily throughout 2014, these investments will have an impact on our margins, just as they did in the fourth quarter, as we spend ahead of our client demand and in anticipation of revenue growth. In order to provide you with more detailed information about our business, our opportunities for growth and our investment program, we will be hosting our first ever Investor Day, which will take place in our offices in downtown Manhattan on Friday, March 21. So to sum up, 2013 was a milestone year for MSCI. Our investments in sales and in client service and in new product development are starting to have a positive impact on our sales and our renewals and our revenues, and you have seen that in the fourth quarter. With our end markets healing and the demand for our tools increasing, MSCI has embarked on a targeted investment plan that we believe will accelerate our growth and reinforce MSCI's position as a market leader in performance and risk tools across all institutional asset classes and for the owners and the managers and the traders of those assets. Let me now turn it over to Bob.
Robert Qutub: Thank you, Henry. Henry spoke a lot about our investment program, and I just want to echo his remarks. This is an exciting time here at MSCI. It is gratifying to see the impact that our new products are having, and we're excited about the kinds of capabilities we will be bringing to our clients in the coming quarters. Let's review our fourth quarter highlights. Revenues grew 8%, driven by organic growth of 6%. Net income declined 13%, and diluted EPS fell by 11%. Net income and EPS were impacted by a higher tax expense and nonrecurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA fell 2%, and adjusted EPS fell 8% as the boost from lower debt cost and lower share count was offset by higher tax expense. On the operating side, we had a strong fourth quarter. Run rate grew by 9% to $1.05 billion. Our growth was driven by a sharp increase in asset-based fee run rate and a 6% growth in subscription run rate. Our organic subscription run rate growth accelerated to 6% from 4% in the third quarter, and retention rates rose to 89%. MSCI continued to benefit from the strong demand for MSCI-linked ETFs. On a run-rate basis, where the comparisons are now to periods in which the impact of the Vanguard loss has been taken into account, asset-based fees grew by 25%. We remain active in managing the company's capital. MSCI received 0.5 million shares as part of the conclusion of the August 2013 accelerated share repurchase program. In total, MSCI has purchased 5.4 million shares and 2 ASRs since December 2012. And as Henry mentioned, we announced another $100 million ASR to be executed after today's close. We also extended our debt facility by 19 months and reduced our mandatory repayments prior to maturity. As has been the case all year, we will highlight the effects of the acquisitions and the CFRA divestiture in the context of organic growth, as well as any impact FX changes have had on our run rate. Now let's get into the numbers. MSCI reported fourth quarter revenues of $268 million, up 8% from fourth quarter 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $114 million, a decrease of 2% versus 2012, and adjusted EPS fell 8% to $0.48. Net income was $47 million, and diluted EPS was $0.39, representing a decline of 13% and 11%, respectively, versus fourth quarter 2012. Our fourth quarter revenue growth was led by the Performance and Risk segment, which reported revenue growth of 10%, driven by higher growth in Index and ESG and RMA revenues, partially offsetting by a decline in PMA. On an organic basis, Performance and Risk revenues rose by 6%. Our Governance segment revenues rose 7% on an organic basis. On a reported basis, however, Governance revenues declined 1% as a result of the divestiture of CFRA. By revenue type, MSCI's total subscription revenue grew by 10% over the fourth quarter 2012. On an organic basis, subscription revenues rose 7%. Asset-based fees rose 3%, as the loss of the revenues from the Vanguard ETFs was more than offset by an increase in revenues from other ETFs and passive funds. Nonrecurring revenues declined 3%. On a run rate basis, our total subscription business grew by 6% to $892 million. Organic subscription run rate growth was also 6%. The growth in our run rate was driven by a 22% increase in subscription sales to $36 million. MSCI's retention rates increased to a very strong 89% during the quarter, up from 85% a year ago. The retention rate for the full year was 91%, and both our fourth quarter and full-year retention rates were at their highest levels since the RiskMetrics merger, a real testament to our investments in client service. On a year-over-year basis, changes in foreign currency rates reduced MSCI's run rate by $400,000. On a sequential basis, the FX changes increased run rate by $700,000. Now let's turn to the performance of each of our 4 major product lines and starting with our Index and ESG products, where revenues grew by 13%, or by 8% organically. Here, the subscription run rate grew 10% to $372 million, driven by organic growth in Equity Index benchmark and data products. Double-digit growth in both ESG and IPD run rate also contributed to the growth. Index and ESG sales rose 48%, and retention rates ticked up to 91%. Now let's take a closer -- let's take a look at our asset-based fees and the related run rate. Our ABF run rate rose 25% versus fourth quarter 2012, and that's in line with the 26% increase in the assets under management when you exclude the Vanguard ETFs. The average basis point fee at the end of the fourth quarter was 3.6 basis points. There was a total of $333 billion of assets under management in ETFs linked to MSCI indices at the end of December 2013. A year ago, if you exclude the Vanguard AUM, that number was $264 billion. Approximately 2/3 of the $69 billion increase over the past year resulted from inflows into MSCI-linked ETFs. Market appreciation accounted for only $24 billion. Also interesting to note is the shift in assets under management over the past year. If we exclude all AUM related to the Vanguard ETFs, AUM in our -- linked to our developed market indices grew by almost 70%, while AUM tied to our emerging market indices, which lagged the performance of the developed markets in 2013, shrank by 19%. The AUM and ETFs linked to MSCI indices really does reflect the performance of global markets rather than any single market or single region. Now turning to Risk Management Analytics. Revenues there rose by 13% year-over-year and by 9% on an organic basis. Our fourth quarter revenues got a modest boost as we completed a modestly higher number of risk system implementations than in the fourth quarter 2012, which enabled us to recognize revenues from those contracts. Run rate of $291 million rose 11%, or 7% on an organic basis. That is an acceleration from the 6% organic growth rate we reported last quarter and is the highest growth rate we have reported since the end of 2011. Sales growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific was offset by lower sales in Australia, Japan and Europe. Retention rates hit a new record, rising to 87% in the fourth quarter from 84% a year ago. FX changes contributed $1.2 million to the growth in RMA versus the fourth quarter of 2012 and $700,000 versus the third quarter of 2013. Switching to PMA. Revenues fell 11% to $26 million, and run rate fell 6% to $103 million. PMA sales remained weak, but retention rates rose to 89% from 78% in fourth quarter 2012. FX changes reduced run rate by $2.4 million versus fourth quarter 2012 and by $700,000 versus the third quarter. Now looking at the year-over-year decline in the PMA run rate of $7 million. Just over 1/3 of that was a result of changes in FX, and an additional 1/3 was a result of product swaps and cancels of our Cosmos fixed-income product. Down sales rather than client losses accounted for most of the remaining $2 million decline in run rate. Now moving to Governance. Revenues rose 7% on an organic basis. On a reported basis, revenues declined 1% as a result of the sale of our CFRA product line at the end of the first quarter. Run rate rose 7% organically to $115 million, driven by sales of executive compensation, data and analytics products and services, along with continued strength in run rate and retention rates. Now let's turn to expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA expense rose by 18% to $154 million. Compensation expenses rose 16% to $108 million. The growth in compensation expense was roughly split between the impact of the IPD and InvestorForce acquisitions and the organic headcount investment we are making. Our headcount rose 18% year-over-year and 4% from the end of the third quarter. The bulk of our new hires came on board in lower-cost centers. Since the end of 2012, we have grown our headcount in emerging market centers by more than 35% and limited the growth in our developed markets to 6%. As Henry noted, we expect to continue to hire aggressively as part of our investment program. As a result, we expect our compensation costs to continue to increase in each successive quarter over the course of 2014. Non-compensation expense, which excludes depreciation, amortization, the lease exit charge and strategic review expenses, rose 23% in fourth quarter 2013 to $46 million. While some of that increase reflects the acquisitions, on a more fundamental level, the growth in our non-compensation cost reflects our need to increase our infrastructure to support our investments in sales, client service and new products. For example, as I noted earlier, we have grown our headcount in emerging market centers by more than 1/3. As a result, we've had to increase our physical footprint in these locations, which drove a double-digit increase in our occupancy cost. Another driver of our expense growth was higher IT spending. We have added to our storage capacity and increased our processing power as we prepare to add new functionality to our software programs. Some of this spend showed up in capital spending but it also drove a 25% increase in our IT spend. A third element of the increase was higher marketing spend, which reflects our stepped-up level of outreach to all of our clients in general, and in particular, to financial advisers. Other non-compensation costs, including professional fees, recruiting and travel expenses, also increased as we stepped up our hiring of key personnel and increased our training and travel budget. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred $1.8 million in expenses related to our examination of the strategic alternatives for our Governance business. As a result of the increase in compensation and non-compensation costs, adjusted EBITDA fell 2% to $114 million in the fourth quarter 2013. Other expense was $7 million in the fourth quarter, essentially flat from a year ago. However, we recorded $1.4 million in expenses related to the refinancing of our debt, which I referred to earlier. And excluding those costs, other expenses fell by $2 million. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 44%. For the full year, our actual tax rate was 35.6%, which came in higher than our previously forecasted tax rate of approximately 34%. Contributing to the higher rate included such items as differences in the mix of our international earnings and state tax rates. As a result of these changes, we had to increase our fourth quarter tax expense to bring our full year expense in line. Going forward, we expect our tax rate for 2014 to be approximately 36%. Should Congress fail to extend the R&D tax credit, our full-year tax rate will be closer to 36.5%. We will continue to update you throughout the year. Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We finished 2013 with total debt of $808 million and with a total cash position of $358 million, of which $96 million was held offshore. During the fourth quarter, MSCI generated operating cash flow of $94 million, bringing the 2013 full-year total to $320 million. Our capital spending was $19 million in the quarter and $40 million for the full year. As we mentioned earlier, MSCI announced this morning that it plans to enter into another $100 million accelerated share repurchase program. As part of that program, we expect to receive $70 million worth of our shares tomorrow morning, based on tonight's closing, with any remaining balance to be delivered at the conclusion of the program in May. With today's ASR, we have fully utilized the $300 million share repurchase authorization granted by our board last year. MSCI's board recently authorized the repurchase of an additional $300 million of our shares. This share repurchase authorization is over and above today's ASR and will be available from time to time at management's discretion. As Henry noted earlier, we plan to continue with our investment program in 2014. We expect this program to position MSCI to add more value to our clients and generate faster growth over the coming years. The impact on our margins, however, will be more immediate. We plan to spend ahead of our projected revenue growth, so we anticipate that our expenses will continue to increase, which we expect will reduce our full year 2014 EBITDA margins relative to the fourth quarter 2013. And last but certainly not least, MSCI will host an Investor Day here in our offices on the morning of March 21. During the conference, you will hear from the product heads of our major product lines about what they are doing to take advantage of the opportunities they see in their markets. It will be our first ever event like this, so we are very excited to help you learn more about MSCI. Invitations will go out shortly. Now let me turn it back over to the operator so we can take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just wanted to start off. You sound a lot more upbeat on the environment. Can you maybe break down trends that you're seeing across the globe, sort of different geographies, and where you're really seeing the bulk of the increased demand?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. Thanks for the question, George. Clearly, U.S. is a better marketplace than it has been for 2 years, 2011, 2012. We saw a very gradual erosion quarter-by-quarter in confidence and in spending habits of investment institutions in the U.S. during that period. And it feels like by the second half of 2013, things began to get better. This is fragile, of course. It's gradual. And obviously, it will depend on the continued improvement in financial assets. But that's a good spot for us. Europe remains about the same. There's less uncertainty in the marketplace in Europe given that people don't talk about the breakup of the euro anymore or the exit of various countries. So that's about the same, with maybe a slight uptick on it. Asia, for us, has been good, not necessarily because of the macro picture at all. It has been because we put a lot of effort into the region. We've deployed a number of resources in our various businesses. We stepped up our client servicing activities, our product development activities and the like, so that, as you heard, in the Risk Management Analytics business, that has bode well for us. In terms of client segments, we have seen a recovery in hedge funds, in hedge fund investors and hedge fund managers. So that has been good for us. We've seen -- we continue to see good prospects in asset owners around the world, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations. Quant managers have recovered a bit, not a great deal but a bit. And loan-only active managers, which is a part of the world -- of the investment world that really suffered and had a lot of lost confidence in 2011 and 2012 and parts of 2013, have begun to feel better about their business models, have begun to gradually launch new active products. So we're benefiting from a bit of that as well.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just to finish off 2 questions on the margins. I know you commented the '14 margin should come in a little bit below the fourth quarter '13 level. Is there a floor that you sort of have in mind? And I realize it's tough to estimate given the ebbs and flows of the AUM on the ETFs side, but is there a floor that you have in mind? And then looking at the investment program, will that start to slow down in terms of absolute dollars as we go into 2015?
Robert Qutub: George, thanks for the question. On giving floors or any guidance, we know that we're going to continue to spend. What makes it very difficult, and you've seen this pattern over the past years, we've got more volatility with the acquisition of IPD, as well as the significant growth we've seen in AUMs linked to MSCI indices out there. So it becomes increasingly more challenging to manage that. But we do expect it to come in lower than what we've shown at 42.6. Now that could be volatile depending on what the revenues drive of it. But we are having a deliberate investment program. And to your second question, we expect these products to take time to evolve, and the resources we need, we'll be bringing them in over a period of time up to one, maybe through 2014, at a level that we can effectively manage the onboarding capacity.
Henry A. Fernandez: And we do plan -- we do continue to -- at the moment, we continue to plan on the investment program at similar levels in 2015 as we plan to do in 2014.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Just a follow-up on those investments. It sounds like it's going to really start to drive some meaningful acceleration in the internal growth. Can you just help us understand kind of the delta between kind of the current run rate and how we get to that? If I heard it right, low double digit. What are the contributors to that?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, I think there are a lot of factors that are kind of in the mix here. We are hoping, and we have begun to see, that the investment world is beginning to come back to some normal levels around the world. Clearly, there are issues of how much of that is currently inflated by monetary policy and how much of that will eventually translate into fundamentals driving asset values of all asset classes, right? So -- and that transition, who knows how it's going to pan out. But we are of the belief that in a 2-, 3-year planning horizon for us, that the world's investment markets are going to go back to some level of normalcy that are going to support the investment spending and the capital spending of a lot of investment institutions around the world. And therefore, we want to be there for that uptick in sales. So at this point, I think it's very hard to quantify, but what we see is that currently, our run rates, when you aggregate them across all the various businesses, are in the mid to high single digits. There are some businesses that are already at 10%. There are other ones that are already at high single digits, and there are some that are -- that have had difficulty and have shrunk a bit, like the PMA business. But when you aggregate all of that and you look at the investment that we're making in distribution to reach out to more customers, upsell existing customers, given the bit of relaxation of their budgets and when you layer on top of that the significant number of new products, so specifically in indices, a lot of new Factor Indices. In our -- in PMA, it's a lot of the new models that we're launching, a lot more that are coming, and the improvements in the software. And in RMA, it's things like performance attribution in the same platform as risk management and liquidity risk and counter-party risk and all of that. So we think that all of that is going to help us accelerate the run rate on an aggregate basis in the next few years to the low teens. And we feel that some of that may be an uplift in the overall environment organically. But we believe that a lot of that will be by our actions of continuing to have high renewals, continuing to increase the level of sales and add to the product set that we offer to our clients.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: And, Henry, ultimately, what should that translate to in terms of EBITDA growth and then the EPS as we think about the leverage? It just sounds like we'll have some incremental spend in '15 as well, but as you kind of hit this new level of revenue growth, what does that do to kind of earnings and...
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, I think that on an EBITDA basis, if we -- on an EBITDA basis, I would assume that in 2014, for example, it'll be more flattish to maybe a little up because of the -- the revenue growth will increase, but the pace of investments and expense growth will be higher than revenue growth, and therefore, it will be flat to up. We're not really looking to be flat to down but, obviously, it will depend a great deal on the volatile aspects of our revenues on ETFs and things like that, right? I think in 2014, maybe a slight improvement to that as we -- you've got to remember that we lag quite -- when we launch new products and when we also book new revenue or new sales, those get amortized over 12 months or longer, so we lag. So the question will become how much of that lagging effect still impacts us in 2015 versus the growth of expenses? So that's the way we're looking at it. But we're not -- at this point, we're not targeting acceleration of EBITDA, for example. We're targeting acceleration of revenue that eventually will lead to acceleration of EBITDA and acceleration of EPS, right? I think the EPS is a little more volatile because of the tax rates and financing cost and things like that, right? Depreciation, et cetera. So that's -- we're very excited about what we're beginning to see in gradual and maybe not a straight-line recovery in our end markets. And we are going to be booking revenues and good sales and good renewals that may lag in the recognition in the financial accounting revenues. But importantly, we want to be there to be there for our clients when they have the demand for a lot of our products.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler of William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Obviously, nice sequential and year-over-year pickup in the new recurring subscription sales in Q4. I think both were about $6 million. So in thinking about that roughly $6 million, what were the main products/geographies that contributed to that growth? And I think -- it sounds like it was largely Index, but if you could clarify that, that would be great.
Robert Qutub: Driving the growth was -- obviously, like you said, Index drove a piece of it. And RMA had a significant contribution, too. Regionally, we had really good -- like we said in the text, that we had very good growth in the U.S., and the Asia-Pacific muted to some extent coming out of Europe. That was probably the principal geographic drivers of it.
Henry A. Fernandez: And let me add also that, because of the comments that I made before, we all have to realize that it was a big crisis, right? And there are a lot of pockets of strength but a lot of pockets of weakness. And there is a lot of realignment that has taken place in the investment world, for example, between passive and active managers and so on and so forth. And so none of this recovery that we see is going to be a straight line. So it's going to be -- some quarters going to be higher. Some quarters going to be lower. In some of these geographies, it's going to be higher, and others will be lower. And some product lines for us will be higher, and other ones will be lower. But the overall aggregate, comprehensive trend that we see is a little bit of an upward sloping curve over the next 2, 3 years, '14, '15, '16. And therefore, we want to capitalize on that. I mean, this is what this company is made for. This is what we're there for. And we really need to capitalize on that to drive value for our clients and drive value for our shareholders.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, great. And then you mentioned, Henry, the factor-weighted indices, the noncap-weighted stuff. I get the impression those products, particularly in ETF form, are largely being used by financial advisers today, that institutional investors are a little bit earlier in the adoption cycle. So just curious what you're hearing from both asset owners and managers on to what degree they are getting comfortable with factor weighting and how they expect to increase or change their usage going forward.
Henry A. Fernandez: It's actually the opposite. I mean, clearly, what is more visible and transparent is the launch of Factor Index ETF, right, because as you launch, you monitor them in the marketplace and the like, and that's a good -- very, very good area for us. We've launched quite a lot of those. They've accumulated some good amount of assets. And we get good fees on those, and we're very, very happy with that. But what is not as visible is that the majority of the AUM -- even the vast majority of the AUM that has come into Factor Indices has actually come from big asset owners, big pension plans around the world, that are looking for alternative to their active management -- management processes, or their passive ones, on the passive alternative to market cap and on the active side are alternative to strategies that they would otherwise deploy actively, they can now deploy them passively. So that's where quite a big part of our effort has gone around the world, and this is not just isolated to one place or another. We've gotten mandates from Canada, from Taiwan, from Switzerland, from other parts of the U.S. It's really across the board, and the dialogue is very active in this area around all these places.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: You've added pretty heavily to headcount over the last, let's say, 2 or 3 quarters. Can you give us a slice of where that -- I know you say it's taking place in some of the lower-cost destinations. But how would you break up that 18%? How much of that is sales? How much of that is people working on the technology side of things? And what can we expect that mix to look like as you add headcount going forward?
Robert Qutub: Well, as I talked about in my comments and Henry referred to, really it's -- there's, generally speaking, there's -- all across the board, we've been adding sales, we've been adding coverage teams out there geographically in new locations. That's important. We've also been adding consultants that you've seen in the investment results in terms of higher retention. With respect to building in capacity and IT, we've had to build out that. Not only is it people, it's also in our infrastructure to build ahead of the demand that we are seeing and we expect to see. And we can do this in multiple locations. We found that we're getting a lot more synergies in the emerging market centers, as evidenced by the 35% increase. And when you see the much -- the significantly lower increase in our developed markets, that's really where we're putting a lot of our coverage teams. And even to a certain extent, some of our consulting teams can also be in the emerging markets centers as well. So again, in short, it's really across the board that we're seeing it. And in certain areas, we're just building in the infrastructure of the company to support the expansions that we have out there.
Henry A. Fernandez: And I think what I would add is that also the -- it's not just the headcount, right, but it's the price of the headcount. So if you say you add 40 salespeople, I mean, those salespeople are in New York, Boston, Chicago, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, so those places like that, which are higher costs. So even -- so if you say you are 40, that's at a higher cost because that's the cost of living in those places. But if you say you add 100 or 150 software engineers in Mumbai and in Budapest and in Manila and in Monterrey, it may look like a larger number of people but it's at a much lower cost. So it's the headcount and where we have it and the cost of the headcount in the places that we operate in.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then my second question is just on emerging markets. We've seen them sputter and I know that a lot of your -- or some of your indices are associated with those emerging markets. How do we think about the balance between the growth in ETF and passive investing and just some of the fluctuations in those emerging markets? Is that something that could offset your growth at some point? Or is the ETF and the passive investing demand so large that it wouldn't really affect it?
Robert Qutub: Let me just refer back to one -- an item we really wanted to point out on the ABF chart is that the distribution, really looking at it from an emerging market versus a developed market, we talked about it on a year-over-year basis, the develop market grew by 70%, yes, 70%, whereas the emerging market declined by 19%. What this shows and the point I was trying to make here is that we're not really -- MSCI-linked indices are a reflection of the global investment platform, and it's not really skewed to any particular sector. Linked quarter basis, we didn't say it, but the emerging markets showed it's just over 27%. That was down by 3%, but that was almost a corresponding shift into the developed market growth, where it's up at 53%. So you see that balance then as the broad reach of our ETFs across the globe. We capture all of the shifts or a majority of the shifts, and also note that our basis points remained strong at 3.6 basis points.
Henry A. Fernandez: The other thing too, so if you look at the emerging market effect to us, Bob indicated that, yes, let's say 1/4 of our EPS are exposed to emerging markets. And that's what gets a lot of attention, right? What doesn't get as much attention is that 75% of our ETFs are linked to developed markets, and a lot of that is around the world. It's U.S. and it's Europe and it's Asia. Why is because the foreign investors are investing into the U.S. equity markets through MSCI indices, right? And the rest of the world, including the U.S., is investing in Europe and Asia through MSCI indices, right? So that's -- sometimes, given the real strength of our Emerging Market Index franchise and which is great, but it sometimes gets exaggerated in the context of the impact on our revenues, right? And on the second part, which is a hugely important part, is that we're up to almost 50% of our employees in emerging markets. And what has happened is that given the turmoil that is going on, is that quite a lot of the currencies in this market have depreciated. And therefore, our cost structure in many of these places has decreased.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I just have a couple of questions. Portfolio management analytics retention was really strong for the fourth quarter, given the usual seasonality. I think a lot of the contracts used to renew in Q4. Is it still the case that the bulk of the contracts renew then? Or do you now spread it more evenly throughout the year? And was there anything specifically, like some of the investments maybe, that you've done that really attributed to -- you'd attribute to these results?
Robert Qutub: There are a couple things, Toni. One is that the contracts are distributed more evenly over the course of the year. And as we talked about earlier, a lot of the retention rate was driven by down sales that we saw over the course of the year, more specifically in the first and second quarters. One thing I'd like to point out is our client count in PMA remains virtually flat, not down. And so that's just a reflection of some of the repricing that we've talked about over the course of the year, which is driving the high retention rate. Also, one other point, too, is we've been continuously issuing -- we had 3 new upgrades on our BPM software, and we've been pushing out models at a much better cadence than we have before.
Henry A. Fernandez: So we said this before, and it flips back and forth a bit, but going into 2014, we feel pretty good about the PMA business that -- it has a very strong foundation. It has that real pipeline of a lot of new models. It's got a lot of acceleration on the software part. We're in dialogues with a lot of people around the world. We have -- we're significantly putting a lot of sales -- dedicated sales and project managers in various places around the world and the like. And then when you go deep into the analysis of the numbers, of the shrinkage that took place, 1/3 is a change in the foreign exchange, 1/3 or so is always swaps with other MSCI products and the like and the third is down sales rather than loss of clients. So now we feel that 2014 is the year that we can flatten things out a bit in terms of not having the clients and maybe get some growth. We said that before. And the market has gotten worse for us. But that's what we're trying to aim here in 2014, right?
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And also, can you give us an update on your relationship with BlackRock? And are there any contract renewals coming up on some of the large ETFs?
Henry A. Fernandez: The relationship continues to be outstanding. Clearly, it strengthened dramatically in 2013 from a high point already, given the Vanguard loss. So on one hand, it was a loss of a client. On the other hand, it was the strengthening of another client. It's not just verbal or qualitative. It's all evidenced in the large number of ETFs that have been launched by iShares across the U.S. and Europe and other parts of the world. So, I don't think there's any major client renewal on the Index side -- any contract renewal on the Index side with them coming up.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey of KBW.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions were asked already, but just thinking about the advisory revenues and the AUMs attached to it and what's been going on with the emerging markets, how long does it typically take for prolonged market downturns to eventually have an impact on subscription revenues? Or is this really just something that's tied to the asset-based fees?
Henry A. Fernandez: You're referring to the downdraft in emerging market equities right now?
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, I think on the active management side and, therefore, our benchmark or data business, we actually don't anticipate much of a change in our subscription run rate and products due to the emerging markets. Bob, I don't know...
Robert Qutub: Let me separate your question into 2 parts, Joel. When you look at the AUMs, you will see some movement either through market or inflows or outflows. So, you're going to see something that becomes more immediate. So that's the volatility that I referred to. And in some cases, when I talked about emerging markets there, in that category of ABF, in a lot of cases we're trying to emphasize is while it may go out of emerging markets, some of those same investors may exit emerging markets and go into developed markets and to MSCI-linked indices. So you can see some movement but mainly on volume and market. With respect to subscription, that's much more stable. These are annual contracts that are out there. And that revenue, I would expect to see less volatility in that over time.
Henry A. Fernandez: I think the punchline to all of you is that we clearly are monitoring very closely the volatility and, in some cases, turmoil in certain emerging markets. But that, in and of itself, is not a source for concern for us, because money flows into the developed markets. We have a larger market share in developed markets, so we may benefit more than that. We have a lot of cost in emerging markets, so it gets cheaper and the like. So it may all wash out or we may have a benefit. I don't know. I mean, we haven't run through a lot of those numbers. I think the bigger concern to us and should be to all of you is what kind of contagion takes place from emerging markets into the world's equity markets and the world's -- the developed world's financial assets. And therefore, what does that mean, right? That's -- so the emerging market itself is clearly something that we monitor. We have clients there. We have people. We have products and the like, and we follow it closely. But it's not something we're worried about per se. It's more what happens to the rest of the financial markets.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great. And then just lastly for me, just a point of clarification. The additional $300 million repurchase authorization, that is not specific to an accelerated repurchase acquisition? That could be done in any way, shape or form?
Robert Qutub: That's correct.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.
Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: So my first question is going to be just M&A, I guess, in general. There's some stories over the last quarter talking about some potential indexing assets that might be up for sale and potentially your interest in those assets. And certainly, I know you can't comment on those specifically, but if you can just kind of remind us what your M&A philosophy is at this point and what sort of criteria would have to be in place for something to be attractive to you.
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. So as I said, we can -- our policy is not to comment on any of that. The second part is that MSCI is a story of organic growth and organic investment, largely. So even though we have acquired businesses before, I think that the value creation to our shareholders over at least the almost 20 years that I've been running the company has been a lot larger with respect to the organic growth of our businesses and the organic investment that it has been by any -- by the acquisition part, right? So that, if 20 years is an indication of the next 20 years, that's one, right? But having said that, we are focused on building out a comprehensive set of mission-critical tools, mostly risk and performance tools, in each major asset class of the world and the multi-asset class for a lot of our clients, the owners and the managers and the traders of assets. So when you look at that vision, then you say where are some gaps that we could accelerate either organically or through acquisition. And the gaps are on equity indices domestically, in domestic markets around the world. We are big in the domestic markets of Continental Europe because of the unification of the markets in Europe. We're not big in the domestic Japanese money into Japanese equities, U.S. money into U.S. equities. And we are taking steps to be bigger organically, but a nice acquisition will help us in that direction if it became available. One thing that we're not as big of is in the risk and performance tools to fixed income portfolio managers or to the fixed income investment process around the world. We are big in fixed income in the context of the multi-asset class offering that we have. We have a lot of fixed income data, a lot of fixed income models, valuation models, mortgage prepayment models and correlation models and the like, all kind of embedded into the multi-asset class offering that we have. So we do plan to be a major player in the fixed income risk and performance. In general, we'll try to do that organically or try to do that through acquisitions. So those are examples of things that we will accelerate. So we view acquisitions as ways to accelerate our organic growth story. And we want to do them in our backyard. We want to do it in things that we understand well and so on and so forth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a couple of follow-ups here since we're late in the call. On the -- first, just to clarify again on the outlook here and the acceleration as you're looking for. When you say get to double digit and maybe even low teens, I heard you say that at one point, and you're talking 2 to 3 years, I mean, you're definitely thinking in '15, '16, '17, right, that's kind of where the run rate's growth will continue. But you're not necessarily saying we're going to see this in 2014 already, right? It's more of like a building over the next few years. Did I hear that right? Or do you need to clarify this?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. For sure, this kind of stuff, unless we have a lot of support from the markets and a lot of our investment, may not happen in 2014. But we want to see a progression. This is not a hockey stick by any means. This is a steady progression of improvement in 2014, '15, '16, '17. Now, we don't put a timeline on this because of a lot of reasons, one -- and that's why we're not giving you a very quantitative and time-based productions, because -- or guidance because the world is still fragile. There are hiccups that are out there happening. We feel well overall about the trend. And also, these investments do take time. Some of them are more short-term driven, and the other ones are more medium-term driven.
Robert Qutub: The one thing I'd give is if you're looking for any -- I mean, if you look for any indicator, Alex, would be the run rate that we have that we finished up in 2013, which is an indication of what our contracts will yield over the coming 12 months.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll now hand the call back over to management for any further remarks.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Nicole. And most of all, thank all of you for your interest in the company and your ownership of our stock. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Sonya. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2013 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2013. A copy of that release may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You will also find on our website a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a description of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, today's earnings release and our other filings with the SEC. Today's earnings call may also include a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: restructuring costs; the lease exit charge; the amortization of intangible assets and non-recurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation of amortization of property, equipment and lease hold improvements, while adjusted EPS also exclude the debt repayment and refinancing expenses and the income tax effect of the excluded items. Please refer to today's earnings release in pages 14 through 17 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will also be referring to run rate frequently in our discussion this morning, so let me remind you that our run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking revenues for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETF licensed to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to Table 10 in our press release for a detailed explanation. In our discussions of both revenue and run rate, we will also be referring to organic growth rates. As a reminder, organic growth calculations exclude the impact of the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce and the disposition of the CFRA product line. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Qutub.
Robert Qutub: Thank you, Edings. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to share some highlights from our third quarter 2013. But before we dive into the number zone, here are some key points. Revenues grew 10%, with that growth split between organic and acquisitions. Net income grew 15% and diluted EPS grew by 18%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% and adjusted EPS, assisted by lower debt costs and a lower share count, grew by 8%. On the operating side, we had a strong third quarter. Run rate grew by 12% to over $1 billion. Our growth was driven by a sharp increase in asset-based fee run rate and 10% growth in subscription run rate. Our organic subscription run rate growth was 4% and retention rates increased to 92% where they've held all year. MSCI continued to benefit from a strong demand for MSCI-linked ETFs. Asset-based revenues grew by 8%. On a run rate basis, where the comparisons have now lapped the impact of the Vanguard loss, ABF grew by 28%. We continued to be active in managing the company's capital. MSCI repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares as part of the conclusion of the December 2012 accelerated share repurchase program and the opening of a second ASR in early August. We have also retained Morgan Stanley to help us explore strategic options for the Governance business, and Henry will have some additional comments on that decision later on the call. As has been the case all year, we will highlight the effects of the acquisitions and the CFRA divestiture in the context of organic growth, as well as the continued impact FX has had an our run rate. Now let's get into the numbers. MSCI reported third quarter revenues of $258 million, up 10% from third quarter 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $113 million, an increase of 4% versus 2012, and adjusted EPS rose 8% to $0.53. Net income was $55 million and diluted EPS was $0.46, representing an increase of 15% and 18%, respectively, over the third quarter 2012. Our third quarter revenue growth was led by the Performance and Risk segment, which reported revenue growth of $23 million or 11%, driven by higher growth in Index and ESG and RMA revenues partially offset by a decline in PMA. On an organic basis, Performance and Risk revenues rose by 4%. Our Governance segment rose 7% on an organic basis. On a reported basis, however, Governance revenues declined 1% as a result of the divestiture of CFRA. By revenue type. MSCI's total subscription revenue grew by 10% over the third quarter of 2012, driven primarily by the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce. On an organic basis, subscription revenues rose 4%. Asset-based fees rose 8% despite the impact of the Vanguard loss and nonrecurring revenues grew $1 million or 19%. On a run rate basis, our subscription business grew by 10% to $879 million. On an organic basis, subscription run rate grew by 4%, led by a 9% increase in Index and ESG subscriptions, 6% growth in RMA and a 5% growth in Governance, partially offset by a decline in PMA. The growth in our rate was driven by an 11% increase in subscription sales, rising to $30 million this quarter. MSCI's retention rates increased over 2012 second quarter to a very strong 92% where it has held all year. Changes in foreign currency rates continued to have a negative impact on our year-over-year comparisons, lowering our run rate by $2 million versus the third quarter of 2012. However, they did have a positive impact on a sequential basis resulting in a $6 million benefit relative to the second quarter 2013. Now let's turn to the performance of each of our 4 major product lines, starting with our index and ESG products where revenues grew by $22 million or 20% and by 9% organically. Index and ESG subscription run rate grew by 23% to $360 million or 9% on an organic basis, driven by growth in Equity Index benchmark and data products. ESG products' run rate continued to grow at double-digit rates. The Index and ESG sales rose 21%, aided by acquisition, and retention rates remained strong at 95%. Changes in foreign currency lifted our run rate by $2 million sequentially, but only had a minimal impact versus third quarter 2012. Let's take a look at our asset-based fees and the related run rate. The 22 Vanguard ETFs that switched their index benchmarks completed their transition during the second quarter, so this third quarter was the first full quarter without any impact from those funds. We've been reporting to you for the past 2 quarters that the loss of those ETFs was clouding the strong growth in other MSCI-linked ETFs and that story became evident in this quarter's run rate comparison. Our ABF run rate rose 28% versus third quarter 2012 and that growth rate was in line with a 30% increase in the assets under management excluding those Vanguard ETFs. There was a total of $303 billion of assets under management at ETFs linked to MSCI indices at the end of September 2013. 1 year ago, if you exclude the Vanguard AUMs, that number was $233 billion, that's a $70 billion increase over the past year and $47 billion, or 2/3 of it, resulted from inflows into MSCI-linked ETFs with the remainder being accounted for by market appreciation of $23 billion. Asset-based fee revenues grew 8% during the third quarter of 2012 driven by revenue growth from passive funds. Revenues from ETFs rose slightly as the loss of the revenues from the Vanguard ETFs was more than offset by an increase in revenues from other ETFs. The average basis point fee at the end of the third quarter was 3.7 points. Turning to RMA. Revenues rose by 7% year-over-year and by 3% on an organic basis. Run rate of $288 million rose $27 million or 10% and by 6% organically. The increase was driven by a combination of robust organic growth, as well as contributions from InvestorForce. Organic sales growth in the Americas and in Asia Pacific was partially offset by lower sales in Europe. Notable sales during the quarter included a major U.S. pension fund and a large sovereign wealth fund. Retention rates remained a positive story rising to 92% from 89% 1 year ago. FX changes had a positive impact on the third quarter, lifting run rates sequentially by $2.5 million and by $1.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Switching to PMA. Revenues fell 10% to $26 million and run rate also fell 10% to $105 million. PMA run rate did increase slightly from second quarter 2013 levels, with virtually all of that change driven by FX benefits. Net sales were modestly positive during the quarter for the first time since the first quarter of 2012, as a result of higher sales and improved retention rates. Looking at the year-over-year decline in the PMA run rate of $11 million, just under a third of that was a result of changes in FX, an additional third was a result of products swaps and cancels on our Cosmos fixed-income product. Down [indiscernible] sales rather than client losses accounted for most of the remaining $3 million decline in run rate. Now moving to Governance. Revenues rose by 7% on an organic basis. On a reported basis, revenues declined 1% to $30 million as a result of the sale of our CFRA product line at the end of the first quarter. Run rate rose 5% organically to $113 million, driven by higher sales of Executive Compensation Data and Analytics products and services, along with continued strength in retention rates. Before we leave our discussion of operating results, let me remind you that while we are pleased with our year-to-date run rate, we have historically reported lower retention rates during the fourth quarter due to the timing of contract renewals. Now let's turn to expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA expense rose by 14% to $145 million, with growth in both compensation and non-compensation expenses, driven primarily from acquisitions. Total compensation expenses, which excludes nonrecurring stock based compensation, rose 12% to $103 million. The growth in composition expense was driven largely by the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce, which were offset only partially by the sale of CFRA and lower severance. Our headcount rose 6% to 3,123 from the second quarter, as we continued to make organic investments in our client-facing activities, product development and infrastructure. We continue to make progress in our efforts to leverage lower-cost centers, including Mumbai and Manila, the percentage of our workforce in those areas rose to 45% from 44% last year and 1 year ago -- last quarter and 1 year ago, which enabled us to keep our organic compensation cost below the rate of the increase in our organic headcount. Non-compensation expense, which excludes depreciation, amortization, the lease exit charge and restructuring costs, rose 21% in the third quarter 2013. The increase was driven by acquisitions and an increase in travel, marketing and recruiting costs, among other items. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 4% to $113 million in the third quarter of 2013. Other expense of $6 million in the third quarter was down from $8 million 1 year ago, as a result of lower interest expense. Our tax rate was 39.9% in the third quarter and 32.8% for the first 9 months, reflecting the nature of how first quarter discrete items impact the rate over the remainder of the year. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 34%, this means we expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 37.5% to 38.5%. Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the third quarter with total debt of $807 million and total cash position of $284 million, of which, $90 million is held offshore. During the third quarter, MSCI generated operating cash flow of $69 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $226 million. During the quarter, we spent $12 million in capital expenditures, repaid $11 million in debt and spent $100 million for the accelerated repurchase program. As part of the ASR we put into place in August of 2013, with the inclusion of the December 2012 ASR, MSCI repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares. That brings the total number of shares we have repurchased as part of those ASRs to 4.9 million shares over the past 10 months. Share repurchase activity continued to -- contributed to a 2.3% decline in the number of diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter. The August 2013 ASR program remains in place and is expected to conclude in December 2013. And of course, let me remind you that we still have an additional $100 million remaining on our existing share repurchase program. And again, I just want to remind you on the tax rates in the -- this year, our tax rate was 35.9% in the third quarter and is 32.8% year-to-date and we're still anticipating a 34% rate for the full year, which means 37.5% to 38% is our range for the fourth quarter. Now let me turn it over to Henry.
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Bob. Good morning. As I have done over the past few quarters, I would like to provide a brief update on the current operating environment. I would also like to speak about our investment program and the positive impact of that program is having on our results. And finally, I would like to discuss our decision to explore strategic alternatives for the Governance business. The operating environment has slowly improved in this past quarter. That improvement in tone has led to an increase in client activity, but it has not yet translated into significant improvement in sales. Broadly speaking, the tone from our asset manager and hedge fund clients in the Americas has brightened and they are feeling more optimistic. European asset managers and hedge funds remain cautious, though. Our business in Asia is doing well. But I attribute that as much to the investments we have made in that region than to any broad recovery in business conditions. And importantly, our pipeline remains healthy. In an operating environment in which our clients remain cautious, we have focused on innovation as a means of improving our growth. To support that innovation, we have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses. Since the beginning of 2012, or over 18 months or so, we have grown our headcount by 700 or about 30%, with more than half of that coming in the form of net new hires and the balance from our acquisitions. About half of our new hires have come in the form of sales and client service personnel and the rest have been split between new product development and technology. These investments are starting to have a positive impact on our results. Over the past 2 years, we have opened new sales offices in markets like Canada, Korea, Taiwan, and have expanded our sales efforts in areas like Russia and Eastern Europe. That investment in those markets has led directly to an increase in sales from those regions. We have also focused heavily on increasing our level of client service, which we see as an important differentiator. Those investments are helping to drive our retention rate to 92% for the first 3 quarters of the year, a level that in the past we would have considered much more aligned to a very strong market rather than the current environment that we're operating. Our investment in new product development is also paying off. And I want to share a few examples with you from each of our major product lines. In Index, we have talked a lot about our development of risk premia indices, which we are now calling MSCI Factor Indices. If you recall, we launched the first of this Factor Indices in 2008. As is often the case with our business, the initial progress appears slow. But over the last 2 years, these products have really started to generate significant momentum. Asset owners, pension funds in particular, have embraced the use of this new indices. The assets under management in ETFs and all the passive funds in these indices have grown significantly. And our run rate tied to these indices has more than doubled since the beginning of the year to about $8 million now. Institutional investors are now embracing this data and these indices to help them achieve their investment objectives at a lower overall cost of investing. Encouraged by this trend, we at MSCI have continued to invest in these products so that we can extend our existing Factor Indices to cover more markets and to develop new indices in new areas. In the RMA business, we saw some of the results of our investment come through in the form of new revenues. We have been focused on enhancing our client views of risks since we acquired RiskMetrics in 2010 and that focus has paid off with several new deals. We continue to win business with regional banks in the U.S., seeking more visibility into counter-party risk. We also launched a new liquidity risk module during the third quarter and have recognized an early sale from that product as well. Other investments, particularly in distributions of the RMA product line, have faster paybacks. Over the past 2 years, we have significantly increased our investment in Asia, adding senior management to the team there and a more dedicated sales focus. Our Risk Management Analytics business in Asia is now growing at a double-digit base. In our PMA product line, total sales have exceeded our cancels for the first time since the beginning of 2012 and some of the currency pressures have also eased. While our sales numbers for this product line are not where we would like them to be, our new Japan Equity Model appears to be gaining some positive traction in the marketplace. This model is the first in a series that incorporates some truly differentiated and significant factors in the development of these risk models. So the level of interest in them bodes well for the additional models that we expect to launch over the next few months. In addition, we contribute to our functionality to our Barra Portfolio Manager software and BPM has already started contributing in new sales to our overall market in PMA. We have also invested in our senior management team, with the recent additions of a new Chief Information Officer and a new Chief Marketing Officer. Chris Corrado and Darla Hastings will help us continue to scale our infrastructure and deepen our relationship with our clients and develop further expertise in the way we market our products. Before I conclude, I want to discuss our announcement about ISS. As stated in the press release, we have begun to explore our options for this business and we will update you when that process is completed. But for now, let me give you some context on how we came to this decision. Over the past 3 years, MSCI has worked hard to return ISS to growth. Our early investments were aimed at expanding the sales force, acquiring new clients, building a more competitive offering and building the voting platform. Once those steps were in place, our focus then turned to new products. First of those new products was an Executive Compensation Data Analytics product suite, which we launched in the middle of 2011. That product launch was among the most successful in ISS history and it remains one of the business's primary growth drivers today. We're continuing to expand our capabilities in that area. And more recently, ISS launched QuickScore, a quantitative governance rating covering U.S. companies. We also bolstered the senior management team of ISS, naming one of our most seasoned executives, Gary Retelny, to head the business. Finally, we divested CFRA, which was the most challenged part of that unit. These investments have enabled us to put the Governance business on a more sustainable growth trajectory. During the third quarter, the Governance segment reported organic revenue growth of 7% and an EBITDA margin of 29%. So we think the time is right to explore our options. I would like to add that we plan to retain the MSCI ESG business, which was also acquired as part of RiskMetrics group at that time and which is reported in our Index and ESG product line. In summary, we are pleased that our previous strategic investments are driving strong results and are enabling us to position MSCI very well for an eventual full recovery in our marketplace. We remain excited about the many opportunities we see ahead of us. With all of that, let me now pause, and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I think, for the first time since I've been on these calls, I'll kick it off with the Governance business. Henry, you talked about the sustainability of the growth trajectory there. The margins have moved up fairly significantly year-over-year, I think you're right around 29% EBITDA margins right now. How sustainable is that and then should we be thinking about this business as being 30% EBITDA business going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez: So, George, I mean, we continue to remain very optimistic about this business. We have clearly done a great deal to position the business for this growth, spent a significant amount of time in the business with investments in sales, in client outreach in competitive offerings, pricing. We have invested in the technology, voting platform and the like. Even at the same time that we have increased the profit margins of it, so a quite successful effort of turning the business around from the quarterly declines that we saw back in 2010, 2011. We also feel that the opportunities here, in this business, are pretty large. Governance is something that everyone talks about every day. The end market of this product line is slightly recovering, like the end market of our Risk and Performance products. So I think the time is right now to be able to explore our options of separating this business from us. We don't know yet, obviously, what the ultimate outcome of all of that will be. But we feel pretty positive about the business and its prospects and where it can head.
Robert Qutub: George, one other comment I would add is, remember, when you're looking at this on a year ago, that included the CFRA margin and the margin now does not.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got you. Got you. And then also the PMA business that seems to be stabilizing on a run rate basis. Obviously, some of the pressures on the FX side are dissipating. It sounded like you, guys, do feel better about that business and the prospects going forward. Am I interpreting that correctly?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes we do. We definitely feel better about it in the last few months, a couple quarters. But we have also felt better in the past and there's been -- double dips are there. I think this time, we feel better for a variety of reasons: one, the market for quantitative asset managers has improved. From, basically, the beginning of this year, you've seen that many quantitative asset managers have been gathering asset inflows into them, they've been launching new products and the like, it's not a major quantum leap, but definitely a little more life into that market. Secondly, the fundamental managers that have client support have began to feel better about their business and have began to have dialogue with us about additional tools that they need, to provide that quantitative support to the fundamental managers, so that may bode well. Also, from our side, we have developed quite a lot of new models that have been introduced in the marketplace and a lot new models that will be introduced in the near future. And that has gotten the market pretty excited about new innovations that we're bringing. And the last piece for us has been the continued development of the software application that we couple, at times, with the content and the risk models. And we feel that we are at the kind of tail end or the lower -- the back end of being able to finish quite a lot of the functionality in BPM and make it a product that is pretty robust, compared to Aegis, and that is beginning to show in additional sales of BPM. Again, it's early days, we still have some way to go there, but we feel pretty good about that.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And just last question for me, the non-comp expense, I know it's up year-on-year because of the acquisition, but it also increased fairly substantially quarter-on-quarter, 2Q to 3Q, I think was up 16% in the SG&A segment. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there and how we should be thinking about that now in the fourth quarter?
Robert Qutub: The sequential increase, George, was driven by, largely, some of the items I highlighted in my comments. We've had some more out of pocket costs as we expanded through our recruiting efforts. As Henry mentioned, we have made some investments in people, our global footprint has continued to broaden, going to 45%, up from 44%. We've made some investments in technology, the non-compensation side, that would reflect our ability to stay up to speed with our capacity, as well as our stability out there, as we continue to grow our client base. Occupancy has gone up a little bit too. So you're starting to see the benefit in terms of what we talked about in run rate, but it comes with some expansion in our capacity to support that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: I just want to make sure I understand the mechanics of that. It sounds like we've repurchased about 2.7 million shares, bringing the total to 4.9 million, and it's over $200 million. How does it work with kind of the remaining incremental $100 million under the ASR, what's the potential there? And then, ultimately, for the additional $100 million out other, should we think about that as another kind of ASR or just kind of more general market?
Robert Qutub: Let me -- this is Bob, Kevin. We look at the 2.7 million in 2 tranches: 1.7 million of that was the close out the ASR that we started in December of last year, where we had an initial delivery of 2.2 million shares and as the purchase program was completed, we received an additional 0.7 million. So that first program gave us 2.9 million shares. With this program we've got just under, the first tranche, we got just under 2 million shares in August, so that's where the third quarter number gets to 2.7 million. We still have to finish the program out through the end of the year. So there could be some shares potentially delivered to us and there could be -- we'd never be in a situation where we'd have to give any back, the way the deal is structured. And with respect to our -- the remaining $100 million on the shelf, glad you pointed that out, that still is out there and we'll be in this market here through the end of the year. And come the first of the year, we'll be talking to our board about 2014 and '15.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And then, Bob, as we think about kind of potential proceeds from the Governance business, should we think about that in terms of capital returns to organic growth or as that kind of comes clear into focus?
Robert Qutub: Well, let me say. Our capital -- basically, our capital strategy has remained unchanged. I mean our investment strategy is around organic investments and bolt-on investments where we can make -- help facilitate capabilities that we need or expedite capabilities or gain capabilities that we need to get. We maintain a balance on that. With our buyback program, we still have $100 million on the shelf, and with respect to whatever happens with ISS it's really just too early to tell.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just, if I could, the retention rates, seems like they picked up nicely, there may be some seasonality in Q4. How should we think about that into Q4, and then a bit longer term too, as we about 2014?
Robert Qutub: I'll take you back to Henry's comments. I mean, we've made a lot of investment on our client side and coverage side to really focusing in on our clients staying with us. I wouldn't say we're defying gravity, but I think that we're feeling pretty strong about how we approach our clients. Our retention rate's at 92%, all 3 quarters is very strong. Now having said that, about 1/3 of our contracts, give or take, renew in the fourth quarter, so you get a higher proportion of them in the fourth quarter. And if you look back, over time, we tend to see a little more volatility in the fourth quarter. Now remember, the retention rate construct is a in-quarter number annualized. So it tends to get sort of exacerbated in the quarter. And why it's, looking at it over a full year, I think it is much better perspective in taking that -- 2/3 of our contracts this year have renewed at 92% retention rates.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Do you expect to generate operating margin expansion in 2014? And if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes.
Robert Qutub: It's -- we're in this business to grow. The best indicator I can provide for you in that, because we generally don't give guidance on that, but take a look at our key operating metric and our discussions around the growth in our run rate on a year-over-year basis. That really gives you a window out there on the forward-looking 12 months in terms of what we would be bringing in terms of driving up revenue growth. As always, we continue to maintain discipline on non-compensation. We have taken a step up in non-compensation expenses that I mentioned earlier. And we will continue to make some organic investments, which will require investments, but we need to balance that out and make sure we turn profitability. Balancing out our whole capital process that I mentioned earlier to Kevin.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I think the revenue side is pretty clear just from the run rate, but think, I guess, I still have a question about spending for next year and thinking about whether you're going to get operating leverage. Is there anything you can add to kind of clarify possible margin trends looking out beyond Q4?
Henry A. Fernandez: Kevin, this is Henry -- I'm sorry. David, this is Henry. The -- I think it's important to recognize that away from the volatility that could exist with the asset-based fee business in which if the markets rally, we get showered by a lot of cash flow that drops to the bottom line or -- and if the market turns negative, obviously it declines. So if you put that aside because that's an element that is, even though secularly improving for our business on a cyclical basis or a seasonal business, sometimes they're not controllable, I think that we are of the view that we are at the beginning of a very gradual recovery in the investment universe of the world, in which you're seeing better tone, better momentum in asset managers, hedge funds, pension funds in the U.S. You're seeing a bit of that in Japan and Australia. You're seeing a tad of that in Asia, x those countries. Obviously, Europe is still a little bit challenged, but we're hoping that, over time, that we're going to see a gradual recovery there. And our clients are asking us to anticipate that recovery and invest in the business. So I think our best view to you is that away from the volatility that could be provided by the asset-based fee business, which we don't control, we're not likely to see an expansion of the margin. We're not likely to see operating leverage in the business because we would want to continue to position the company for that upturn and the demand that we see -- that we're beginning to see, reflected in the tone of the dialogue and the actual dollars and cents that clients want to spend with us.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: That's very helpful. Just a quick, related question. Do you have an early read on headcount, a target for 2014?
Henry A. Fernandez: Not at the moment. Not at the moment. We haven't finalized our plans for 2014.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then 2 quick housekeeping questions, Bob. Do you have a share count at the end of the quarter? And just a read on 4Q and 2014 tax rate.
Robert Qutub: Let me get back to you on the exact share count, that's going to be on our Form 10-Q that we'll file later this week. Okay?
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And tax rate?
Robert Qutub: Tax rate is the guidance that we talked about.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: For 2014?
Robert Qutub: No, we don't have guidance on that yet. But I just talked about what we'll -- 34% is what we expect for the full year. We maintain an aggressive approach, focused approach, on how we can optimize our global tax rate. And as we continue to grow more and more internationally, we should see some benefit of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just -- sorry to come back on the expenses one more time. But it seems, Bob, you talked about what drove it higher in the third quarter. I think, for the most recent question you talked a little bit about next year and the longer-term outlook, which, I think, can be appreciated. But can you just talk very specifically about the fourth quarter again? Like was there some seasonality in the third quarter in terms of the recruiting? Is the run rate a pretty good run rate to use now or are some employees coming on late that will drive this even higher? Is there a lot of hiring that you're doing in the fourth quarter? So just a little bit more specific on the fourth quarter, if you may.
Robert Qutub: On the fourth quarter, or more of the third quarter, Alex?
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: No, no. On the fourth quarter, in terms of expectations for, in particular, SG&A.
Robert Qutub: I mean, we've -- our headcount coming on board tends to slow down in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the second and third quarter are your strongest times in which you get people in your seats and where you make a lot of your hirings, it's the most economically -- the most efficient, so you kind of take us -- you couple that with related costs that would be around recruiting and things of that sort. We've had some internal onetime items that have occurred, nothing significant, Alex. But again, we maintain a tight discipline on costs into the fourth quarter.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, good. And secondly, I think, good color again on the selling environment, I guess, improving. Can you be a little bit more specific in terms of how that is manifesting itself? Is the pipeline of new sales shortening? Is the -- are pricing discussions getting -- are there lower pricing discussion? Are people not pushing back as much? Are you seeing less from -- on the competitive side? So a little bit more color on what's happening on the sales side here.
Robert Qutub: Starting with pricing, we remain strong in our pricing and our index product. RMA, we're maintaining our pricing. PMA, we still have some competition out there. That's, really, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the decline in our run rate has not come from lost clients, it's come, largely, from that third, is coming from repricing of the products that have been out there, driven by competition. Again, RMA product, Governance products, Index products remain strong and, to a certain extent, Index has continued to maintain its pricing strength. With respect to the pipeline, the pipeline, as Henry said, remains healthy. And that's the tone that we've held out there for the last couple, 3 quarters. In fact, the tone, that's something we introduced into our conversation last quarter and we maintain that. There's a lot more active conversation and we have seen some 2-way movements in the pipeline. What I mean by that is up and back. Though in the past we see -- we saw more deals pushed out, but we have had discussions about trying to pull some deals in. So the active conversation is really important. It's around the conversations that we're having with them and the real key is manifesting those into sales.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And so the sales cycle itself seems to be kind of, it goes back and forth, it's fairly unchanged on average, I guess. Is that what you're trying to say?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. Let me add to what Bob said. The -- what was happening for about, say, 6, 7 quarters, starting back in the spring of 2011, was that every -- taking seasonality away or putting that aside, every quarter, there will be a very slight deterioration of the operating environment and that was manifested into items in the pipeline, not necessarily leaving but more and more items in the pipeline being pushed to the next quarter and the next quarter. And more approvals by clients, more debate and discussion about whether they should buy the product or not and the like. And it was also manifested in a bit more cost-consciousness and price pressures because our client is reporting to their own internal people were under a huge amount of pressure to contain costs. What we began to see about 1 quarter or 2 ago, let's say 2 quarters ago, is that, that gradual deterioration, that was happening quarter after quarter after quarter, began to ease. So it wasn't that it was improving, it was that the deterioration was less 2 quarters ago, slightly less last quarter and that, therefore, the items that would otherwise have been pushed to the next quarter, some of them were staying in the current quarter. And then secondly, that the number of approvals began to decrease a little bit and the willingness of clients to try to get the deal done and close and move on, increased. And the overall tone of the discussion, the overall tone of trials and show me new things, show me new ideas, show me the new things, the dialogue has improved in the U.S. and in Asia, a little less so in Europe. So that makes us cautiously, very cautiously optimistic, that we're beginning to see a gradual, very gradual sort of return to a more active dialogue, less deterioration of the pipeline, quarter-to-quarter. As we said, the pipeline remains healthy and, right now, we have helped all of these by creating new products. Because when you have a new product, the client wants to engage. The client wants to have a discussion and sometimes the clients creates budget when they have a new product that they think is going to differentiate them in their investment process. So the Factory Indices have been an extremely important dialogue with a lot of our clients. The liquidity metrics and the counter-party risk has been a good dialogue with our clients. And the OTC market moving to centrally-cleared products, the margining and the products that we can offer on margining has been a good dialogue with our clients. In PMA, the new Japan model, we had a roadshow in Japan, very well attended, people are interested. Then we have a new Korea model coming out, a lot of our Korean clients are interested in that. And we're rolling out a whole series of models. We're in more active dialogue on BPM, because now the software is much more completed, complete than it was a couple quarters ago. So overall, it feels better. And therefore, this makes us feel that we got to continue to progress in the pace of investments in the business, back into the business in order to continue to capitalize on those trends. And if those trends accelerate, accelerate the level of investment. So that's where we are in that gradual, small recovery process.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's very helpful. Just one quick last one here. One of the things we're hearing more and more in our business is that I think we have the best start-up phase for new hedge funds than we've seen in, like, 10, 12 years or so. So not sure if this is a big focus for you, or how material it can be. But are these guys just not big enough yet or are you actually focusing on new sales into that channel as these guys are starting up and, obviously, need a lot of tools to run their business?
Henry A. Fernandez: We definitely have seen, year-over-year, a marked improvement in our dialogue on activity with hedge funds that are particularly in the U.S. A bit less in Europe. And we have heard and seen clients leaving -- personnel, leaving from one to another to set up new hedge funds, and we're in active dialogue with many of them. That has not, though, yet translated into significant sales to those potentially new startups. I think that they are potentially in fund-raising mode at the moment. So remember there's always a lag. If you have somebody who wanted to start a hedge fund, they may leave, they might put a business plan in place, but they've got to go raise the money and that may take 3, 6, 9 months. So we're seeing some of that, but it hasn't translated into them purchasing the tools at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I wanted to focus for a second on the headcount growth. So 6% growth sequentially, 29% growth over the last 12 months, the top line over that time is growing at 10%. So just thinking about it rationally, does that mean that you're going to potentially hire considerably fewer people over the next 12 months than you have over the prior 12 months, I guess x acquisitions?
Robert Qutub: Chris, let me -- you got the 6% correct, but the 29%, remember, goes back to the beginning of 2012. So that's over a 2-year period. You got to remember of that 700, half of that was through acquisitions, so that growth has been recent in terms of what we've been picking up, but the acquisition contributed to more than half of it. The important thing that we highlighted, and that Henry talked about, is half of those hires, nearly half of those hires, came in the form of client-facing and getting out on the street, working with the clients, as well us on the retention side too. So retention is a really valuable investment payoff for us and staying at 92% means it's 1 less sale we have to make to retain the run rate. So that we find as very important. The other thing I'll make and, Henry, you can throw in a couple things here, is that our organic growth is built on people. Our organic growth is built on capability in the most efficient way we can. And the comment that was made that while we have grown our headcount organically, we've grown our compensation costs, related to that headcount growth, less. And that's by focusing in on lower-cost centers that are out there and continuing to drive that from 44% to 45%, both on a linked-quarter and year-over-year. And if you remember, last year-over-year, we didn't have the impact of IPD and InvestorForce, we've actually brought that down in the interim quarters. So we continue to push out on that capability because we have to have the innovation, and the innovation comes from people to be able to build the products that Henry was talking about so we can sell into this gradual recovery we're seeing out there.
Henry A. Fernandez: The other point I would add is to say that we're very much focused on meeting the current demand from our clients and anticipating the immediate demand the 6, 9 months, 10 months from our clients, with existing products and new products. And when you work backwards from there, you then need to make incremental investments to position yourself for that demand and that -- hopefully increasing revenue growth. And investment to us is all people, so mostly people. There are some technology investments in the space and all, but people or people-related things. And therefore, we say, "How do we make those investments in a way that there's balance and in a way that doesn't meaningfully handicap our profitability?" And that's why we rely heavily on our emerging market centers. The next phase that we do is how do we make those investments in a way that are balanced, that let's make the investments have a quicker payback first. So just new sales in markets where we see demand and so just client-servicing and solutions personnel that we see continued improvement in retention rates and renewal rates. So about half of the past investments have gone into that. The next layer that we're focused on is, okay, we now have to enhance products or create new products. How do we balance that out? How do we make some incremental, prudent investments to invest in those products and the like? So that's what we've done. Where we are right now is that we're saying that's what we've done in the last 1.5 years, almost 2 years, since the beginning of 2012. We anticipate that, that is the philosophy we're going to continue to have going into 2014, because it's working, the paybacks of those investments has generated incremental revenue and run rate we actually have seen in RMA and Factory Indices and PMA, slowing down the decline there, and Governance and the like. And not only that, but we're -- if we see further improvement in the tone, further improvement in the sales effort, we want to make sure we capitalize on them.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, makes sense, guys, I appreciate it. And then just one more, on the CIO and CMO hires, just -- can you talk about each of those a little bit more and why was now the right time to make those hires as opposed to 6 or 12 months ago?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. On the CIO, we are a technology company as you all know very well. Big parts of our business rely heavily on technology. The Index business, which is mostly a content business, relies heavily on technology and the manufacturing of the data, so to speak, the production of the data and the distribution of the data. And our Analytics business do the same, but not only that, our product is actually a software program that we run 4 people in our ASP SaaS solutions. So we have been discussing over the last 12 months, how do we continue to improve, scale up and make sure we have a very strong foundation to continue to go to clients and perform for them highly mission-critical processes. Coupled with that is that a few clients have come to us and have asked us to take significantly more of their internal mission-critical processing in risk management and in performance. And therefore, we felt that the strengthening our technology organization would be prudent in order to begin to plan for those potential sales. So that was the reason we hired a CIO and that's the reason we're going to add a few more senior people in that area. On marketing, we've grown significantly. We have now $1 billion in run rate, we have some 8,000 clients in 85 countries. We have a multi-product line. We reach out to many corners of the world. And in the past, we've done it kind of the old-fashioned way, which is one client at a time, one person at a time, talking to people and the like. I think the time has come that we develop MSCI into a very marketing-focused organization that we figure out what are the most effective and efficient means to reach out to clients. How do we develop stronger client relationship at all levels of organization? How do we use branding as a way to deliver our messages? How do we use advertising? Which we've been doing in the U.S. to deliver our message to the financial advisory community so that they can buy MSCI-linked products and the like. So there is a lot of areas that I think that, with Darla Hastings now as the CMO, she can help us become much better as a marketing company and, hopefully, expand our reach, expand our product line and make it a more coherent whole.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just a quick one for me. With regard to IPD and InvestorForce, are there any opportunities to cut costs out of those businesses going forward?
Robert Qutub: With respect to IPD, there were -- the merger was not really -- a lot of flare on synergies, but yes, definitely, there are some synergies, especially as we combine a lot of the infrastructure and modernize a lot of the data capabilities that they have. InvestorForce, less so. InvestorForce is really a client and revenue play, from that perspective, and that was very easily bolted on to our existing infrastructure with -- not really designed for cost savings.
Henry A. Fernandez: That will be, though -- Toni, the plan will be, though, that whatever significant reductions in costs we have on IPD, we would want to reinvest back into the business. The reason is, we believe we're in a cyclical -- sorry, in a secular upswing in real estate across the world, both in terms of the market appreciation, with limited supply in many markets around the world. Secondly, the increasing institutionalization of the real estate asset class. And lastly, an increasing globalization of the investment in real estate. So we bought this business in order to create what we believe to be a very large presence in risk and performance in real estate around the world. We are, right now, pretty big in Europe. We are taking steps to increase significantly our presence in the U.S. and in Japan and in other markets in Asia. And therefore, that's going to require continued investment that we plan to make from the cost savings that we have, not necessarily, obviously, dropping profitability of the business.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. And also just with regard to those 2 acquisitions, are there any areas where you've had either upside or downside surprises? Maybe additional clients that you wouldn't have necessarily thought would want to cross sell in something. Any sort of surprising either to the upside or downside of those?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think the positive surprise have been that: one, the business have not been really -- the business have not really focused significantly on asset owners around the world, pension plans and sovereign wealth funds and the like. So we have started hiring and putting a dedicated team to do that and it has began to pay off well in the last 2 quarters. So that's been pretty good. Secondly, is that our footprint, the core MSCI footprint, in many markets where IPD didn't have the time or the resources or the headcount to go out and sell, has been beneficial to them. So we've opened a lot of doors for IPD in Korea, for example. Some of these other sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and in Asia. And, clearly, our relationship with many of the pension plans in the U.S. have helped open the doors. And lastly, we are in the early stages of a major dialogue with clients, especially asset owner clients, about the incorporation of the real estate asset class in the total portfolio of the fund, what are the diversification benefits, what are the risk issues associated with them and the like, in order to see if we can become a catalyst for the further institutionalization and globalization of real estate investment by institutional investors. Early days, because that takes time, but we have a number of research papers, we have research conferences going on and the like, that are attacking that and that's one MSCI team of research people from the performance side, the risk side and the real estate side. I think, on the negative surprises, so to speak, has been we have started to transform the IPD business into the way we look at the world in terms of recognition of revenues and in terms of run rates and the capturing of those rates and the like. And those have been a little bit of the volatility that you've seen in the last 2 quarters or 3 quarters in the ups and downs of the revenue on IPD.
Operator: And at this time, I'm not showing any further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Sonya, I appreciate it. Well, just want, before we close, to remind everyone to please feel free to call me if you have any questions on the quarter. We want to thank you for your interest in MSCI, and thank you especially for your ownership of our shares. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Edings Thibault Robert Qutub - Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer Henry A. Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
Analysts: Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Sam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2013 earnings call. I'm joined on the call this morning by our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Henry Fernandez; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Bob Qutub. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the second quarter and first 6 months of 2013. A copy of that release may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You will also find in our website a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date in which they are made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs, and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2012. Today's earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: restructuring costs, the lease asset charge, amortization of intangible assets and nonrecurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, while adjusted EPS also excludes debt repayment and refinancing expenses and the income tax effect of the excluded items. Please refer to today's earnings release on Pages 14 through 17 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will be referring to run rate frequently in the discussion this morning, so let me remind you that a run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking revenues for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETF license to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to Table 7 in our press release for a detailed explanation. In our discussions of both revenue and run rate, we will also be referring to organic growth rate. As a reminder, organic growth rate calculations exclude the impact of the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce and the disposition of the CFRA product line. With that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Qutub.
Robert Qutub: Thanks, Edings. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to share some highlights from our second quarter 2013 before we dive into the numbers. First, we reported our financial results for the second quarter with revenues growing by 8%, driven by the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce. Net income grew by 63% and diluted EPS grew by 67%. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS grew by 8% and 16%, respectively. Our revenue and EBITDA growth benefited from the seasonal strength in IPD revenues, which as we forecasted, came in at more than double the first quarter amount. We expect less seasonality from that product line in the second half of the year and more on that later. Our subscription run rate grew by 9%. Our growth was driven by acquisitions, an uptick in sales and by strong retention rates across all 4 of our major product lines. By product line, index and ESG remained the biggest driver of MSCI's organic run rate growth. RMA run rate growth picked up slightly and a sequential decline of PMAE. Governance run rate also continued to grow on an organic basis. Asset-based fees continued to drive growth for MSCI, notwithstanding that the transition of Vanguard ETFs was completed in the second quarter. Last but not least, we completed our December 2012 accelerated share repurchase program and announced our second $100 million ASR this morning. As Henry will discuss, today's ASR is part of the decision made by MSCI late last year to return $300 million in capital by the end of 2014 added an integral part of a very disciplined capital deployment strategy. Now as was the case of the first quarter, we will highlight the effect of the acquisitions and a divestiture in the context of organic growth as well the continued impact FX has had an our run rate. Now let's get into the numbers. MSCI reported second quarter revenues of $258 million, up 8% from second quarter 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $117 million, also up 8% year-over-year and adjusted EPS rose 16% to $0.58. Net income was $61 million and diluted EPS was $0.50, representing an increase of 63% and 67% respectively over second quarter 2012. Most of the difference between the growth in adjusted EPS and diluted EPS was the $21 million of refinancing expenses we recorded in the second quarter of 2012, which is not factored into adjusted EPS. Our second quarter revenue growth was led by Performance and Risk segment, which reported revenue growth of $21 million or 10%, driven by higher growth in index and ESG and RMA revenues, partially offset by a decline in PMA. On an organic basis, Performance and Risk revenues rose by 1%. Our Governance segment revenues rose by 3% on an organic basis. On a reported basis however, governance revenues declined by $1.5 million or 5% as a result of the CFRA divestiture. By revenue type, MSCI's total subscription revenue grew by 8% over the second quarter of 2012, driven primarily by the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce. Asset-based fees also rose 8% and nonrecurring revenues rose $1 million or 17%. On a run rate basis, our total subscription business grew by 9% to $861 million. On an organic basis, subscription run rate grew by 4%, led by a 9% increase in index and ESG subscriptions, 6% growth in governance and 5% growth in RMA, partially offset by a decline in PMA. The growth in our run rate was driven by an increase in subscription sales to $31 million and a robust 92% retention rate. Changes of foreign currency rates continued to have a negative impact on our results in the second quarter. FX changes lowered our sequential subscription run rate by $1.3 million and changes over the past year have lowered our total subscription run rate by $6 million. Now turning to the performance of each of our 4 major product lines, starting with our index and ESG products. Revenues there grew by $22 million or 20% and 5% organically. In line with our guidance, IPD had a seasonally strong second quarter, contributing $17 million to index and ESG subscription revenues, up from $8 million in the first quarter. This seasonality in revenues is because one of IPD's major products consists of annual benchmarking reports, many of which are delivered in the second quarter. We expect second half revenues from IPD to be roughly equal those of the first half but with a much more equal distribution than the third and fourth quarters. Therefore, we expect to see a decline in IPD revenues in the third quarter. The seasonal strength in revenues also had a positive impact on our adjusted EBITDA as we'll touch on later. Index and ESG subscription run rate grew by 23% to $351 million or by 9% on an organic basis, driven by growth in equity index benchmark and data products. ESG product's run rate continued to grow at double-digit rates. After a $2 million negative hit in the first quarter of 2013, the FX impact eased significantly but still resulted in a $0.5 million sequential drag on run rate during the second quarter. Now let's take a look at our asset-based fees and the related run rate. During the second quarter, the transition of the 22 Vanguard ETFs that switched their index benchmarks was completed. This process wrapped up at the beginning of June, and those ETFs contributed only $800,000 of revenues in the second quarter versus $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2012. Asset-based fees continued to be an important driver of MSCI's growth. If we were to exclude the run rate associated with those 22 ETFs that changed benchmarks from the second quarter last year, MSCI ABF run rate would have grown by 23%. Even factoring in a loss, our asset-based fee revenues grew 8% versus the second quarter of 2012. That speaks to a significant shift in the mix of our fees from MSCI-linked ETFs and increased revenues coming from other index non-ETF sources. On a run rate basis, the difference between the decline in AUM and the growth in run rate is even greater. MSCI's asset-based fee run rate grew by 2% despite an 18% decline in the AUMs linked to MSCI indices. Effectively, the $60 billion increase over the past year in AUMs and other ETFs offset the loss of the roughly $120 billion of Vanguard AUMs that left. There was $270 billion of assets under management in ETFs linked to MSCI indices at the end of June 2013, down $88 billion from the end of March. Of that sequential decline in AUM, $75 billion was driven by the transition of the Vanguard ETF and $13 billion was a result of declines in the equity markets. Excluding the transitioned ETFs, the average realized fee on MSCI-linked ETFs was 3.6 basis points. The diversity of MSCI indices tracked by ETFs proved to be a strength in the second quarter as outflows from emerging markets linked to ETFs were offset by inflows to funds linked to Japan and other indices. 48% of the ETF AUMs are linked to global developed markets, excluding the U.S., while only 31% are linked to emerging markets. A further 16% of the AUMs are linked to U.S. indices. Now let's turn to risk management analytics revenues, which rose by 4% year-over-year and 1% on an organic basis. The run rate rose $22 million or 9% and by 5% organically. Sales rose 15%, driven by a combination of organic growth, as well as contributions from InvestorForce. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen stronger growth in sales to hedge funds and asset owners, offset by continued hesitancy on the part of asset managers. Retention rates remained strong and, in fact, picked up to 93% from 90% a year ago. FX changes, which had been a headwind in the first quarter, were a slight positive in second quarter and were essentially neutral on a year-over-year basis. PMA remains challenged. But an increase in the aggregate retention rates helped slow the sequential decline in run rate during the second quarter. Revenues fell 11% to $26 million and run rate also fell 11% to $105 million. FX changes reduced the run rate by $3.3 million year-over-year, including $700,000 during the second quarter. Now stepping back, when you look at the core equity analytics business, which represents substantially all of the PMA product line, the biggest pressure on its run rate has come from down sales at existing clients, which accounted for 1/3 of the $12 million decline in run rate. Now only 10% came from outright losses of equity analytics clients. The remaining 55% or so, the decline was driven by a combination of the FX impact, product swaps into other MSCI products and cancels of our Cosmos fixed-income analytics product, which we are winding down anyway. Turning to governance. Revenues rose by 3% on an organic basis. On a reported basis, revenues declined 5% to $29 million as a result of the sale of our CFRA product line last quarter. Run rate rose 6% organically to $112 million. The growth in governance run rate was driven by higher sales of executive compensation analytics products and services, as well as by continued strength in retention rates. Let's turn next to expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA expense rose by 8% to $141 million, with growth in both compensation and non compensation expenses. Total compensation expenses, which excludes nonrecurring stock-based compensation, rose 9% to $102 million. The growth in compensation expense was driven largely by the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce, which were offset only partially by the sale of CFRA. Our headcount rose to 2,957 from 2,384 a year ago and 2,844 in the first quarter as we continued with our investments. We continued to make progress in our efforts to leverage lower-cost centers, as the percentage of our workforce in those areas rose to 44% from 41% in the first quarter and 42% a year ago. Our ability to tap into a global talent base enabled us to keep our organic compensation cost below the rate of the increase in our organic headcount. Now on compensation expense, which excludes depreciation, amortization and the lease exit charge and restructuring cost, rose 7% in the second quarter of 2013. The increase was driven by the acquisitions. Excluding the impact of those acquisitions, non compensation cost remained in check. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 8% to $117 million in the second quarter 2013. Our EBITDA benefited in the second quarter from the seasonality of IPD revenue recognition. Because we recognized most of our cost ratably over the year, any seasonal increase or decrease in revenues has a direct impact on EBITDA relative to the prior quarter. Other expense was $6 million in the second quarter, down from $30 million a year ago. We recognized $21 million of refinancing expenses in the second quarter of 2012, the impact of which was excluded from our adjusted EPS calculations. Our tax rate was 33.1% in the second quarter and is 31.4% for 6 months through '13. We now expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 34%, which means we expect a higher tax rate in the second half of 2013. Let's now turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the first quarter with total debt of $818 million with a total cash position of $335 million, of which $82 million is held offshore. During the second quarter, MSCI generated operating cash flow of $86 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $157 million. During the quarter, we spent $4 million in capital expenditures and repaid $11 million of debt. Last week, we concluded the $100 million accelerated share repurchase that was announced in December 2012. As a result, we reduced shares outstanding by an additional 762,000 this week, bringing our total shares repurchased as part of that program to approximately 3 million at an average purchase price of $33.47 per share. We also announced today that we intend to enter into another $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement following the close of the market today. As part of the ASR, we will receive tomorrow $70 million worth of MSCI shares at the onset of the program with the exact number of shares based on today's closing price. The balance of any additional shares would be delivered at the conclusion of the program, which we expect will be in December. So for example, if we used yesterday's closing price of around $35, we'd expect to receive approximately 2 million shares. If the share price goes up, we'd receive slightly less or if it goes down, slightly more. But the exact number of shares that we receive will be available in the 10-Q, which we expect to file tomorrow. As a reminder, both the shares we receive upfront and the 762,000 shares we received in the last installment of the 2012 ASR will come out of our share count calculations as of the beginning of August. After today's announcement, we have an additional $100 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Also looking forward, we continue to expect our CapEx budget to be in the $30 million to $35 million range for the full year. And our scheduled debt payments for the balance of 2013 are now $22 million. Let me turn it over to Henry for some additional comments.
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, when I spoke on this call, I talked about the operating environment and what we, at MSCI, are doing to focus on growing our business. This quarter, I want to continue that conversation by providing an update on the operating environment, our recent initiatives of innovation, the changes that we see that are occurring in our asset-based fee business and an update on our analytics businesses. I would also end the discussion with a few comments on the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we announced today and how it fits into our balanced approach to capital allocation. So first, the operating environment. It remained largely the same in the second quarter. Sales to asset owners remained healthy. And we saw some improvements in our sales to hedge funds as the managers across the world remained relatively cautious. Looking around the globe, we did see an improvement in the tone of our dialogue with our clients in the U.S., which is our biggest market. Elsewhere, some of the optimism that we saw in Asia in the first quarter was dimmed by market volatility in the second quarter. And Europe remained largely unchanged. As in the past, our pipeline of products remains healthy. On to innovation. Our focus at MSCI remains on driving growth via innovation. Many of the new products we have launched this year are starting to have an impact in the form of an increased engagement with our clients. Examples of these products include; the continued strong interest in our strategy indices, the addition of margin replication capabilities to our risk products and a new Japan model in equity analytics. We're also seeing a lot of interest from our corporate clients in our new QuickScore governance product. Innovation is also more than just new products. Increasingly, we are approaching clients as a single integrated company at MSCI rather than as a collection of several business lines. Our ultimate goal is to bring more of the unique value of MSCI's products and services to bear on our clients' investment processes. For example, we recently signed a large Asian asset manager to a deal that encompasses both BarraOne and RiskManager, as well as real estate data from IPD and governance services. In North America, we recently sold our comprehensive risk management product to a major Canadian bank that incorporates a core risk system with our hedge fund transparency products. In other cases, we're incorporating governance products in our pitches to start up hedge funds, especially activist hedge funds. These deals are not necessarily driving large dollar sales yet, but they are early examples of how approaching our clients with a more comprehensive suite of products makes our solutions more valuable to them. As part of the process of approaching our clients with MSCI as a single integrated entity, we're also building out a key client relationship program. Our goal is to deepen our relationship with our largest clients and keep our finger on the pulse on how their businesses and their business strategies are evolving. Let us talk about the changes that we see in our asset-based fee business. This area continues to be a driver of MSCI's growth. As Bob noted, asset-based fee run rate grew by 23% when you back out the loss of the run rate from the ETFs that switched indices. That growth reflects the continued strong demand for ETF products from a wide range of investors. It also reflects the steps we have taken to continue to make our indices the premier choice by a wide range of asset managers worldwide. Let me elaborate a bit. First, we have sought to strengthen our relationship with our largest clients. For example, over the past year, iShares has launched more than 20 new ETFs linked to MSCI indices. In addition, recently, we have entered into a marketing and trademark licensing agreement with iShares to promote the MSCI brand. Second, we have focused on broadening our business, both in terms of the total ETFs listed worldwide, as well as the number of ETF managers. Over the past year, we have added 5 new ETF managers. As we have focused on Asia, we have added new relationships with Harvest asset management from China and Mirae from Korea. In North America, we have new relationships with Van Eck, which is notable because they have traditionally been a self-indexer, and of course, with Fidelity, who is licensing our sector indices in the U.S. Third, we have also increased our revenues from other non-ETF index funds. Over the past few years, the share of our asset-based fees that we received from non-ETF passive funds has increased, and that trend has picked up in the past year. And fourthly, MSCI remains very focused on the continued development of strategy indices, also referred to in the industry as risk premia or smart beta indices. These strategy indices provide our clients with a differentiated set of indexed strategies to meet their investment goals. Examples include our Minimum Volatility Indices, Economic Exposure Indices, Dividend Yield Indices and so on and so forth. We are seeing lower-cost, differentiated investment strategies becoming an increasingly important component in our clients' investment portfolios. This approach is part of their intense focus on value for money. MSCI is uniquely positioned to exploit that trend given our capabilities across both indices and portfolio management analytics. Our analytics tools help clients assess the impact of their market views on their portfolios and identify gaps in those portfolios, some of which may be addressed by differentiated investment strategies. At the same time, our strategy indices are designed to reflect an increasingly large number of investment strategies in a transparent, replicable and passive way. These strategy indices are driving a significant amount of our new licensing activity across the world. During the second quarter, ETF managers launched 12 new ETFs linked to our strategy indices, and we expect further launches in the second half. Let me now turn our attention to our analytics businesses. Our risk management analytics unit had a solid second quarter. We have seen stronger sales of our RiskManager products to hedge funds and we continue to make very good progress in our sales to the asset owner community. During the second quarter, we were successful in convincing one of the largest Canadian asset owners to adopt our RiskManager system for measuring market risk. A key factor in our win was our ability to incorporate position-level risk reporting for hedge fund portfolios. We also sold a combined market and counterparty credit risk capability to a large U.S. regional bank. We now provide market risk systems to 4 of the top 6 U.S. regional banks. I mentioned earlier that we added a new margin replication offering for centrally cleared OTC products. This is an example of how we are adding capabilities designed to meet very specific needs that we have identified in the marketplace. With mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives, there will be a need for all parties, not only to make up key margin calculations in real-time and in pre trade situations, but also to be able to anticipate future margin requirements. In addition, dealers need to be able to explain those margin calculations to their buy-side clients. And some of the clients will want to be able to independently replicate those calculations. So our broad client reach, coupled with our ability to react quickly to emerging needs, are a major competitive differentiator and provide us with an ability to continue to grow our business. The performance of our equity analytics business improved in the second quarter. The new Japan equity model that I mentioned earlier incorporates innovative new factors in its analysis of market drivers. That model is an example of the kind of new approach that will be required to stabilize and eventually grow the PMA product line. Our enhanced Barra Portfolio Manager software has also been an important driver of our new sales for this product line this past quarter. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to highlight again our announcement that we intend to enter into a new $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement at the end of today. Our company and our board made a commitment last December that we will seek to repurchase $300 million of our shares before the end of 2014. Today's announcement is a step towards fulfilling that commitment. In fact, only 8 months after the initial announcement, we will be 2/3 of the way towards completing our current authorization. Beyond our commitment to return capital to shareholders, the ASR is a signal about the strong cash flow dynamics of MSCI's business model. We have put that cash flow to use in a balanced way to drive growth and return capital. In the past 18 months, MSCI's strong cash flow has enabled us to invest nearly $200 million to make strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to fund organic growth. We have also repaid more than $260 million of debt and now buy back $200 million of our shares via these 2 ASRs. Let me now pause there and turn over the call to the operator to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Maybe just on the financial, starting with the expenses here a little bit. Those certainly surprised us. So maybe you can give -- on the positive side, being lower than what we expected. So maybe you can give a little bit more color, talk about maybe the outlook if there's anything else we should think about in the second half. And then maybe more specifically, you highlighted the whole emerging shift in terms of your employee base. So is that a function of maybe some of the salespeople related to Vanguard and other products like, moving or discontinuing? Or is there something bigger going on here that we should be thinking about?
Robert Qutub: Alex, this is Bob. A couple of things. The expenses on an organic basis remain -- when you start with non compensation, remain pretty much in check. Actually, they were down a little bit. The growth that we saw in there was coming from our acquisitions. And if you look back over time, we have kept our non compensation expenses pretty much in check. With respect to compensation expense, if I'll take you back a year, remember our cost, we had about $3.5 million, nearly $4 million of one-time changes that came through last year so that would naturally compress the year-over-year growth. But turning to your question on the emerging markets, this is really a continuation of a journey we started a long time ago. And you can see we're at 44% now. We were at 42% a year ago. We'd actually ticked up to even a higher number than that, 45%, before our acquisition of IPD, which brought us down. And what we're doing here is allowing ourselves to build capabilities in these lower-cost centers that allow us to have more capability to invest more within our company on an organic basis that we've talked to you about previously.
Henry A. Fernandez: I would also add a couple of points. One, specifically referencing your comment on Vanguard, there is no expense savings at all associated with the loss of that revenue. So that did not factor into the expense equation here. Secondly and very strategically, what we have accomplished at MSCI, which I believe puts us in a great position to scale the business up, is an ability to -- in a significant number of emerging market centers, is to have an ability to recruit talent, onboard it, train the talent and put it to work effectively in obviously places like Mumbai, like Manila, like Beijing, Monterrey, Mexico, Budapest and the like. So we have a management infrastructure. We have the office space. We have the technology. We have the teams that operate globally and so on and so forth. So as we see a gradual improvement in the operating environment and as we see an ability for us to continue to increase the level of investment in new solutions or innovative products, all services to our clients, we will be able to scale up the company significantly by utilizing these emerging market centers. So that's something that we have been focused on developing and building. And we are largely there at this point. Clearly, there's always things that you could do, but we're largely there, and position us very well for continued investment and large investments in the company without taking a bite out of profitability and scaling up the company when the markets return in earnest.
Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful color. Just shifting then to the asset-based business or the ETF business, in particular. I know this is a difficult question to answer, but obviously, you had a laundry list of new products, new partners and so forth. So wondering if you can give us your best guess in terms of the fee rates, as you think about some of these newer, higher fee products versus you also have the iShares core, which is lower. So where do you think they will shakeout? And what's the trajectory over the next few quarters as these ramp?
Robert Qutub: As you'll see with new funds, we'll have certain minimums in place. So as the AUMs start to build, we'll see some differentiation in the pricing. But right now, when you exclude the Vanguard, as I said earlier, our overall is about 3.6 basis points. And for the near term until assets build, it probably would be stable around that. We'll just have to keep an eye on those AUMs as they grow and exceed the minimums.
Henry A. Fernandez: I will say the fee is relatively -- the fee structure is relatively stable at this moment in terms of a lot of the new products. What we are accomplishing is even wider levels of diversification of this business, diversifying by listings across the world, by top of indices. Clearly, a lot of the launches in Asia have been China-related and Asia-related so that helps also diversify the index base. And we have a two-pronged approach, which is continue to deepen the relationship and the licensing activities with our largest clients, and at the same time, being able to pick up new clients, new ETF managers. So we're very comfortable where we are in the fee structure, which is stable. We're very comfortable on the level of diversification of the business, that doesn't rely on either one index or one country or one region of the world or one manager. So that has paid in spades in this environment, including the loss of the Vanguard funds.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So wanted to start off on the recurring sales side. I think this is the first time in 6 quarters that you had year-over-year growth and the first time in 3 years where you grew sequentially, 1Q to 2Q. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how much of that is really from better execution from the MSCI salesforce, that integrated approach, versus some of your clients with the market being up, actually starting to loosen their purse strings a little bit?
Henry A. Fernandez: George, I think it's definitely a combination of factors, the quiver of arrows, right? It is -- one, it's definitely strong execution. I mean, we have been very focused on continuing to grow and defend the business in the last 8, 9 quarters. I mean, the sequential, gradual erosion, very gradual erosion started probably back in May of 2011, right, with the European debt crisis and continued quarter-by-quarter, as you mentioned. So we were extremely -- we have been extremely focused and we'll continue to be in executing better in all aspects, looking for new clients. If somebody wants to cancel, negotiating with them, to make sure that we address their problems and retain -- first of all, retain the client, and secondly, retain most of the revenue and so on and so forth. So that's one element. The second element is that there is a bit of a better tone, especially in North America, happening. And I'm not sure that translated into a lot more at the margin here. But it feels like it may translate at some point in the future into better sales. But that may have ticked up a bit, the conversion of the pipeline into sales. Our pipeline remained healthy. The issue continues to be the sales cycle, the approvals of the clients need to go through and so on and so forth. That has not yet changed dramatically, even though the tone has changed. So I think, overall, you feel that -- now there are areas that we have put a lot of more effort into it. So for example, in risk management analytics, we put a lot of focus on Asia, moved some senior people over there, hired some salespeople and the like, and we're seeing an uptick in there. We've looked at the hedge fund space and created differentiating pricing to emerging hedge funds and in mature hedge funds and the like. And that has helped those penetrate that space better. So there is a combination of all of those factors. And hopefully, it will bode well when that better tone translates into, at some point, better sales. Let me add one last point. In all of our businesses, you have to remember that we have a relatively higher reliance on 2 areas. One, a client segment called the active asset managers, which are going through structural changes, and secondly, the U.S. market. So what has happened in the last 12, 18 months is that the U.S. market hasn't been as ebullient, even though the economic recovery has been better than other markets. Hopefully, that will start to change. The tone is better, but we have to see it translated into sales. The active management segment is still undergoing some cautiousness around the world and we haven't seen that changing yet. But hopefully, with better equity values, less pressure from the passive managers and so on and so forth, that may get better in the near future.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. That's good color. And then Henry, you sounded very positive on the outlook for ETF launches, MSCI-linked ETF launches, over the back half of the year and going forward. Can you maybe parse that out between launches in the U.S. and internationally and if you're seeing a lot more momentum on the international side?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, look, what I specifically mentioned, George, was the launches of strategy in the ETF, right? That is -- we have some good momentum going there. That's what other people call smart beta or risk premia or the like. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about the launches of a lot of different ETFs. But that clearly has slowed down from a year or so ago across the world. We also continue to be cautiously optimistic about launches of ETFs in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, with China-related ETFs. And that's an area that has been challenging to penetrate, even though the China markets are undergoing some bearishness. But I think the launches of ETF may bode well because the China regulators are also opening up the market to more and more international investors. So even though the markets are not performing as well, but ETF managers would like to get a presence there with their licenses to be able to invest in the China market. So I think, overall, we continue to progress well with launches. The key to the AUM and the profitability to the revenue of this business will be a balancing out -- a balancing act between current large ETFs that we have and the inflows or outflows and appreciation or depreciation of assets in those compared to the new funds.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore Partners.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Have you seen any change in your sales cycle? Have they lengthened or shortened in your risk management business and your index business?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, largely the same. The tone is better in the U.S., a little better in Japan, the same in Europe, probably the same in non-Japan Asia. The tone is better in those specific markets, but the sales cycles remain about the same. The approval processes that we have to go through with clients remain the same. We're hoping that if this trend continues, a better, positive tone in the bigger markets, such as the U.S., that may translate into a little shorter cycles gradually and less approvals and the like. But that -- we need to remain cautious and we need to see that materialize before we claim any kind of victory.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And just one more quick question. I noticed SG&A was flat year-over-year. Could you just talk a little about the drivers of SG&A and if that level is sustainable?
Robert Qutub: I think when you look at it year-over-year, some of the costs that I referred to in the compensation side, for example, we had higher costs. Actually, we had probably between double occupancy. We had severance. We had cost that would be in there that increased, I would say, normalized numbers, if you go back and look at what we said in the second quarter of last year. So the growth was a little bit more than it may have appeared on a year-over-year basis. And the non compensation piece is actually, if you normalize it, as opposed to, as I said in check, it was up a little bit on a real-time -- on a same-time basis. Not a lot, but we've kept it in check.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to ask about -- I thought that the results in the asset-based fee business were strong. And you talked earlier on the call about the non-ETF sources contributing, specifically I think, the passive fund component. So I was wondering, is this a focus of yours on diversifying? So is it an internal push towards diversification? Or is this more client-driven with more assets going into these passive vehicles that are linked to MSCI? And also if you could give us an idea of the magnitude of how large this is now versus a quarter ago or a year ago, that'd be helpful.
Henry A. Fernandez: Toni, we spend the better part of last sort of 10 years at very actively working with the institutional passive managers around the world, ensuring that the licensing arrangement they have -- that we have with them, converted from flat fee to AUM basis, clearly at levels that are much lower than the ETF because it's high levels of institutional passive. So pretty much the entire passive industry in Japan is under this and the U.S. and some of the clients that we have in Europe. So that was the work that was done and was put in place. So we keep focus on it in terms of incremental, but largely, a lot of that work was put in place a few years back. So therefore, the benefit that we're now receiving is as the world has, in the last few years, put a lot of emphasis on passive investment, of which obviously ETF is one example of, but there are other examples in institutional passive, passive accounts that are separate accounts or institutional pooled vehicles and the like in a lot of these places, as I said, like Japan, like the U.S. and places in Europe, then those assets have risen and the AUM fee that we charge of them, the asset-based fees have increased. We expect that trend to continue as the world continues to put more assets on a relative basis into passive compared to active equity management. So we expect that trend to continue and for us to be a beneficiary of that trend.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just lastly, I was wondering if you could talk about potential for expanding the business and derivatives based on MSCI indices.
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, that's a great question because we are extremely focused on working really hard in developing very strong relationship with various derivative exchanges around the world to create complexes of derivative products that can be traded on MSCI indices. We clearly have such an arrangement with the New York Stock Exchange Liffe U.S.A. that has increased quite significantly in terms of creating an open interest and all of that. We're also increasing the number of indices that are being launched into derivative contracts there. In the first part of the year, we announced a licensing agreement with Eurex in Europe to do the same and a number of products have been launched there. We continue to strengthen our capability and relationship with SGA (sic) [SGX] Singapore Exchange in Singapore, as well, we're in dialogue with other exchanges in Asia. We're in dialogue with some of the exchanges in Latin America about this. So that's a big area of focus for us. It's an area though that products get launched, some of them work, some of them don't work. It takes time to accumulate volume and open interest. So it will take time to accumulate revenues of material magnitude. What we like about this is what we call the index ecosystem, which is it creates an ability from the asset owner being actively benchmarked to our indices to being able to execute a strategy passively with index funds or actively with our active management clients and being able to hedge or speculate or overlay risk with the derivative contracts that we put around the world. So all of it is an ecosystem that builds on one another, the legs, the feet on one another. And that's one of the more strategic reasons that we're doing it in addition to the revenue so that we can continue to strengthen the ETF business and the benchmark business with derivative contracts. So the revenue, sometimes you pick it up on the contracts themselves. But sometimes you pick it up by the ability of having more active and passive products on the benchmarks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: On the strategy indices, stepping back a bit, Henry, do you see that market -- I guess, I'm just curious how you see that market evolving over the next few years. Is it a market where you think scale is going to matter as much as maybe it does in the traditional ETF business? And I ask because right now, it seems like there are a lot of different fundamental weightings being used out there from a multitude of providers, obviously some of whom are self-indexing.
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, I believe that there is a quiet revolution going on in the index world from, what did you say, in addition to the provision of market betas, i.e. indices that reflect the beta of a market, so give me the performance of Japan or emerging markets or Europe or U.S. or whatever. In addition to that, to the provision of indices that capture the beta of an investment strategy depending on where you are in the investment cycle. So clearly, in this current part of the cycle, everyone is focused on yield and everyone is focused on volatility. And therefore, a lot of the work that is taking place in the strategy indices are on those 2 fronts. How do you reduce the volatility of a portfolio and still come up with a similar in return? And obviously, for more retail investors, how do you create an equity portfolio with sustainable and consistent dividend in the constituents of the portfolio? So I think that is here to stay. And obviously, depending on the cycle, the indices are going to be different. So if you think about cycle of growth, hopefully we'll get to that at some point, economic growth, it would be more on growth stocks, it would more on momentum stocks and the like. If you see a cycle of higher inflationary expectations, it will be -- give me a portfolio of -- or an index that has stocks that are more resilient to inflation and can pass prices to their consumers and investors and the like. So again, depending on the cycle, you're going to see different kinds of investment strategies, and therefore, you're going to see different kind of indices. We are uniquely positioned in the marketplace to do this kind of work because a lot of our research people come from the buy side, from asset management. Secondly, our PMA, our equity analytics capabilities, this is what we do. We build models and we build software to give it to clients to quantitatively develop investment strategies and back-test those strategies in order to come up with their own investment portfolios. So we're using a lot of those capabilities internally to develop with our teams, develop those quantitative processes to understand how these investment strategies can be replicated in the form of an index and back-tested and provide to our clients to be used either passively or actively. So clearly, the competition changes. Quite a lot of our competition is no longer index providers. The competition ends up being -- some of the broker-dealers, some of the investment management staff and the like that are trying to either self-index or broker-dealers trying to create a basket of securities that somebody can invest in. So we are a leading provider in this space. We're capturing quite a lot of the market and we want to be a premier provider in this area. And I don't think it's going to change. The only thing that would change is type top of indices you will be providing. But this is here to stay and is, as I said, a quiet revolution that is going on.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: All right. And then just one more question. In the PMA business, thanks for some of the detail there, which was helpful on the run rate. Just given the 4 or 5 different pieces that, I think, Bob mentioned, how do you see those different components trending? And if you add all those pieces together, do you think there's reasonably the PMA run rate is going to stabilize over the next few quarters?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, the last part is what we've been trying to reach, right? And we did reach it for a little bit of time, and then it ticked down again. I think fundamentally, what has happened is that the end market for these products have changed. And some of our offerings were designed for part of the market but not for the newer part of the market. So what you see happening -- and that's obviously happening to the quantitative asset managers and the quantitative support of fundamental managers in the way they support their fundamental clients, right? What we're trying to do is reposition the business, right, to where the demand is going in many respects, at the same time, that we continue to sell and protect the current book of business in the context of clients that are also struggling with that transition. So quantitatively, asset managing has changed dramatically from August -- it started in August of 2007. And so what a lot of the change have been is people are now looking for different datasets that they can read signals from. So therefore, we're try to supply the ESG dataset, the economic exposure dataset and the governance dataset and the like. So people are looking for more customized models. People are looking for better software that helps them do more things, in particular, real-time things and the like. So again, we think there is a healthy demand for a lot of things in this space. It just is that we're working pretty hard on investing to move those products and those innovations to that part of the demand at the same time as we continue to protect the current set. So I am cautiously optimistic, but I have been for some time. And clearly, we've seen some downgrades here in the last few quarters. But we're working pretty hard at it and we believe that there is an opportunity here for us to develop a good business that will grow if we reposition it well.
Operator: And at this time, I'm not showing any further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, all, for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your ownership and your support. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Sam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2013 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release describing our results for the first quarter 2013, and a copy of that release may be viewed on our website at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You'll also find there, a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs, and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2012. Today's earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: restructuring costs; and non-recurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EPS also excludes the amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and debt repayment and refinancing expenses. Please refer to today's earnings release and pages 14 through 17 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will be referring to run rate frequently in our discussion this morning, so let me remind you that a run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking revenues for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months, assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETFs license to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to Table 7 in our press release for a detailed explanation. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Qutub.
Robert Qutub: Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Let me share some highlights from the first quarter before we dive into the numbers. Earlier this morning, MSCI reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2013. Our operating results were highlighted by 10% growth in our total revenues aided by recent acquisitions, continued growth in our subscription run rate and a strong growth in our adjusted earnings per share. Our index and ESG subscription run rate continue to be a strong driver of our growth rising 9.5% organically, and the recovery of our governance business also continues. Our asset-based fee revenues also grew, rising 6% year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from strong inflows into MSCI's ETFs despite the impact of the loss of much of the revenue related to the 22 Vanguard ETFs, which started to transition away from MSCI indices this quarter. After adjusting for the loss of Vanguard in both periods, this business would've grown by 15%. Our portfolio management analytics unit continues to struggle as we expected in the first quarter, down -- fell and, to a lesser extent, the impact for the weakening end continued to put pressure on run rate growth. Our IPD acquisition accounted for $8 million of index and ESG revenues in the first quarter. First quarter, though, is the seasonally lowest revenue quarter for that product line, and we expect second quarter revenues to be significantly higher. I'll touch more on that later. Finally, we continued our policy of a balanced capital deployment. We acquired InvestorForce, divested CFRA and repaid a modest amount of debt in order to lower our overall interest expense. Now let's get into the numbers. MSCI reported first quarter revenues of $252 million, up 10% from first quarter 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $110 million, up 8% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS rose 30% to $0.57 per share. Net income was $59 million, representing an increase of 34% over first quarter of 2012. Our first quarter revenue growth was led by the performance in the risk segment, which reported revenue growth of $21 million or 11% driven by a higher growth in index and ESG, energy and commodity analytics and risk revenues, partially offset by a decline in CMA. On an organic basis, which for purposes of analyzing revenues, excludes the impact of acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce, Performance and Risk revenues rose by 6%. In addition, you should note, the first quarter of 2012 was negatively impacted by a $5 million revenue correction in our energy and commodity analytics product line. Our governance revenues segments rose $1.5 million or 5%. When you take a look at our revenue growth by type, quarterly subscription revenues grew the most with $22 million or 12% over the first quarter of 2012, or 7% organically, and asset-based fees rose 6%. On a run rate basis, our total subscription business grew by 8% to $848 million. On an organic basis, which for purposes of analyzing our run rate, excludes the impact of the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce and the divestiture of CFRA, our subscription run rate grew by 3% led by a 10% increase in index and ESG subscriptions, 5% growth in governance and 3% growth in risk. Also, the volatile foreign currency market continued to have an impact on our hour growth, reducing our subscription run rate by almost $8 million year-over-year. Total sales of $40 million were down 7% from first quarter 2012. Our overall retention rate remains solid at 92%. On a sequential basis, our run rate grew by 1% organically, impacted in part by $6 million of the currency headwinds relative to the fourth quarter of 2012. Let's take a look at the performance of our 4 major product lines starting with our index and ESG subscription products. Revenues there grew by $13 million or 18%. On an organic basis, revenues grew by 7%. Before I go on to discuss index in ESG, I want to spend a moment on IPD. IPD contributed $8 million in revenues during the first quarter 2013, a number that we expected to be a seasonal low for the year. This is because one of IPD's major products consists of annual benchmarking reports, many of which are delivered in the second quarter, resulting in a strong seasonal tilt in revenue recognition to the second quarter. We expect second quarter revenues to be approximately twice those of the first quarter and we also expect second half revenues to be recognized more evenly over the final 2 quarters. The timing of revenue recognition has no impact on cost which, for the most part, are recognized ratably [ph] over the year. Index and ESG subscription run rate grew 24% to $344 million or by 10% on an organic basis, driven by growth in index benchmark products. IPD got off to a good start to the year, but some of that progress was offset by a $2 million negative impact on foreign currency changes on the run rate. As I begin my discussion of asset-based fees, let me remind you that we continue to reflect Vanguard revenues in our reported P&L along with the related AUMs as a measure of performance. However, we have adjusted our run rate, which is a forward-looking measure, beginning in the third quarter 2012 to reflect the loss of the Vanguard ETFs. Our asset-based fees benefited from a combination of solid performance and strong inflows in ETFs linked to MSCI indices, offset in part by the migration of some of the Vanguard ETFs to other indices during the quarter. Revenues rose 6% on the back of an increase in overall assets under management and higher revenues from non-ETF asset products. Asset-based fee run rates fell 2% year-over-year to $134 million as a result of the Vanguard loss. But if we also excluded the run rate attributable to the Vanguard ETFs run rate at the end of the first quarter 2012, our annual asset-based fee run rate growth would have been 17%. There was $357 billion of assets under management in ETFs linked to MSCI indices at the end of March 2013, flat year-over-year, and down 11% from the end of December. On that, $72 billion was in Vanguard ETFs and have yet to transition with $285 billion in non-Vanguard ETFs. Excluding the transitioning of Vanguard ETFs, our average realized fee on MSCI-linked ETFs was 3.6 basis points at the end of the first quarter. On the flow side, MSCI had another strong quarter. In total, MSCI-linked ETFs benefited from $22 billion of total inflows. $14 billion of those flows were worked into ETFs that we expect will remain linked to MSCI. Those flows were offset by the migration of $83 billion in Vanguard ETFs. When we report our monthly AUMs tomorrow morning, or tomorrow afternoon, on our website, we will report the impact of further migration in April of an additional 8 ETFs, with total AUMs of $28 billion as of April 16. That leaves only 5 Vanguard ETFs with AUMs of $45 billion as of April 26 that remain to be transitioned. Risk management analytics revenues rose by 5% year-over-year, and by 3% on an organic basis. Run rate rose $17 million or 6% and by 3% organically. RMA sales remained flat year-over-year, but ticked up slightly on a sequential basis. We did see an uptick in sales in Europe during the quarter, but that was offset by weaker sales in other regions. Overall, I would describe business trends here as steady during the first quarter relative to prior periods. Retention rates remained strong at 94%. It is also worth noting that foreign exchange rates negatively impacted RMA run rate by $2 million relative to the fourth quarter 2012. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of InvestorForce. We're only 2 months along, but the early trends are positive. Our portfolio management analytics product line continued to face challenging conditions during the first quarter. Revenues fell 5% to $28 million and run rate fell 10% to $106 million. As was the case last quarter, the decline in run rate was also impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, which lowered the run rate by $2 million on a year-over-year basis and $1.5 million relative to the fourth quarter. Sales picked up slightly from a quarter ago but continued to like [ph] cancels. We did launch several new products, including a significant upgrade to our portfolio management software, but too early yet to see any impact from those products. Governance revenues rose 5% to $32 million as the recovery in the segment continues. Our run rate fell 2% year-over-year as a result of the loss of CFRA. And on an organic basis, which excludes CFRA, run rate increased 5%. Total sales growth slowed as we began to lap the rollout period of our new U.S. compensation data and analytics products, but retention rates remained strong, especially for our core proxy research and voting products and services. We sold the CFRA forensic accounting product line at the end of the first quarter, so we will start to feel the loss of the $10 million in annualized revenues during the second quarter. As noted earlier, it has already come out of our run rate. Let's turn next to expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA expense rose by 12% to $142 million with substantially all of that growth coming from higher compensation expense. Total compensation expenses rose 16% to $107 million. The growth in compensation expense was driven primarily by the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce and, to a lesser extent, by an increase in overall annual compensation levels for other employees. Our headcount rose to 2,844 from 2,465 a year ago, and the percentage of our workforce in low call [ph] centers remain flat at 41%. Non-compensation expense was flat in the first quarter of 2013 despite the acquisition. That's the outcome of the continued tight focus on trying to minimize expenses in this area, as well as the impact of not having to carry some of the double-rent expense in IT cost we incurred 1 year ago as we shifted on New York and Rockville office locations and reconfigured our data center strategy, as well as other cost benefits.  Adjusted EBITDA rose by 8% to $110 million in the first quarter of 2013. Our effective tax range was 29.5% in the first quarter of 2013, down from 35.6% in the first quarter of 2012 and 36.3% for all of 2012. Our tax expense benefited from several discrete items, including a reduction in state taxes and the reinstatement of the 2012 R&D tax credit. Taken together, those items totaled up to a $3.8 million benefit to our quarterly tax expense. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the 34% to 34.5% range. Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the first quarter with total debt of $829 million and a total cash position of $263 million, of which $69 million is held offshore. During the first quarter, MSCI generated operating cash flow of $71 million. We spent $5 million of that for capital expenditures and used $23 million to acquire InvestorForce. We also spent $26 million to repay debt in the quarter, which we anticipate should enable us to reduce the interest rate on our remaining term loan by 25 basis points under the terms of this facility. The $100 million accelerated share repurchase that we announced in December continues to be ongoing and the 2.2 million shares we withdrew at the time enabled us to lower our average diluted share count by 1% since first quarter 2012. That ASR program will expire no later than July of this year. Looking forward, we continue to expect our CapEx budget to be in the $30 million-$35 million range for the full year. Our schedule debt repayments for the balance of 2013 are now $33 million, and MSCI did not use any cash to buy back stock during the first quarter because of ASR, so we continue to have an outstanding repurchase authorization for up to $200 million worth of our shares that we intend to use over the stated[ph] time. Now let me turn over to Henry for some additional comments.
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Bob, and thank you, all, for joining this call. As Bob focused quite a lot on our financial results, I want to focus my remarks this morning on innovation, what are we doing to generate stronger growth on MSCI. Innovation has always been a very critical element to MSCI's success. In a slow marketing environment, like the one we have seen for the last several quarters, it is even more important and critical. MSCI has made significant investments in order to step up our level of innovation. Over the past 2 years, we've grown our headcount from 2,000 employees to more than 2,800 by making selective bolt-on acquisitions and a significant additions to our sales and client service team and our new product development efforts. And as you know well, those investments means people and headcount and the ability to create new products and services to our clients. Those investments are starting to pay off in the form of a steady stream of new products. So for example, to help equity managers worldwide, we introduced new momentum indices, rolled out new quantitative modeling -- models covering the North American and ETF markets, added new back-testing functionality to our portfolio manager platform and enhance our InvestorForce analytics. On the multi-asset class side, we launched a new performance attribution tool that will enable investors to better understand both the performance and risks of their multi-asset class portfolios using a common set of data and analytics. In addition, during the quarter, our governance unit rolled out QuickScore, a quantitative governance rating system covering U.S. public companies. We do not anticipate that any of these products will single-handedly lead to a significant increase in our sales over the next few quarters. That is really not just the way our business operates, and the nature of our business. But the total sum of all these new products is increasing, which should result in our products delivering a higher level of value to our clients and we expect, over time, a higher level of overall sales and, therefore, growth for our company. New products are the most obvious example of innovation, but we are innovating in other ways. Over the past few quarters, we have dramatically stepped up our level of activity in the index business outside the traditional benchmark subscription business. We have put in place a series of agreements with a worldwide network of derivative exchanges. These agreements will enable investors and traders to tap into a wide range of MSCI-linked futures and options, and centrally clear, structured products. We have increased our level of engagement with the managers or of [ph] the investors in ETFs. A lot of our progress here has been a little bit overshadowed by the Vanguard presentation. But as Bob indicated, we have seen very good traction in a number of MSCI-linked ETFs when compared to similar ETFs based on other indices. That is a powerful sign that given the choice between a competing index and those that are designed more directly addressing the investment needs and which link them to a broader family of global equity indices, many investors have opted for an MSCI-linked ETF. We're also investing in our governance business by increasing our sales efforts in order to take advantage of the demand for compensation data and analytics, not only in the U.S., but also outside of the U.S. in markets like the U.K. and Canada. A big focus of our innovation efforts is an initiative that we internally call, 1 MSCI. 1 MSCI starts with our strategic goal: To continue to build mission-critical, performance and risk tools for each major asset class and to be used by managers, owners and traders of this asset class. The primary focus of this 1 MSCI initiative is to deliver the full value of the MSCI platform, i.e., the data, technology, operational procedures and processes, research insight, our modeling capability, et cetera, to our clients in the form of new and enhanced products and also integrated products that add value to their investment process. So, for example, a client wants to know if the performance measurement and standards that we use for equity portfolio management tools are the same that we use for the equity part of our multi-asset class tools. We can show them the common elements, the inputs and the products that we create from those inputs, and the way we combine them to create tools for investment management, risk and performance, equity portfolio management and all other important processes that are mission-critical to our clients. To do so, we will need to continue to leverage even more our common platform and further integrate our businesses to create new products and enhance existent products with a unique set of data and tools that are delivered to them in a cost-effective manner. We have taken several steps to make the 1 MSCI initiative a reality. First, we have started to reposition our sales force so that they focus on integrated solutions for clients in addition to the historical product sales. Secondly, we are using our client service teams, spread around the world, to coordinate cross product approaches to the issues and the needs that our clients present to them. We call this ladder initiative, internally, the Client Experience. Most recently, we have instituted also a new client ownership management program in which we are assigning some of our most senior managing directors to our top accounts. This last step is critical. Our largest clients are major users of almost all of our product lines. So a major buyer of indices is also likely to be a major buyer of risk systems and/or portfolio management analytics from us. In fact, 9 of our top 10 clients are large clients in at least 3 of our product lines. By managing these critical relationships more closely and by working on solutions to their needs, we believe we can continue to strengthen the links between our products, create new integrated products, innovate more and make sure that our clients are getting the full value of our suite of products that we can deliver to them. And over time, we believe that this is going to add another layer of growth to our business. As you can see, we've been very busy. Our new product pipeline currently is as full as it has ever been in recent years. In the coming months, you will hear more about our new indices, innovative new risk capabilities, further upgrades to our software, and so on and so forth. With the acquisitions of IPD and InvestorForce, we have acquired products for which we think there is growing secular demand around the world. We will be investing in order to further develop and enhance those products and expand their distribution around the world. We continue to invest in our technology platforms, including the integration of our portfolio management and risk management platforms. At the same time, as Bob noted in his remarks, we're going to continue to keep a tight reign on expenses, especially non-compensation expenses. We have always been very disciplined on this front, so we expect to continue in that fashion. We will also continue to use our cash to bolster our returns and supplement our growth. You can see the benefits of that with our refinancing and the benefits we have on our interest cost. And of course, the more modest impact that our accelerated share repurchase have on our shares outstanding. All of that will continue. Let me end where we began. We reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2013 with 10% topline growth, 8% adjusted EBITDA growth and 30% adjusted EPS growth. Our asset-based fees continue to demonstrate resilience and growth even as we go through the transition of the Vanguard fund. Despite a continued challenging environment worldwide, we remain focused on innovation, both in the form of new products, as well as the continuing emphasis on exploiting the full value that the MSCI platform can deliver to our clients. I want to stop there and turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I wanted to start off on the RMA side. And specifically in the past, you've said that the pipeline for those services remains very, very robust. It's been an issue of actually converting that into sales. Can you provide a little bit of color again, as to how big the pipeline is, has there been any shift there? And is there anything different competitively in that environment, maybe over the last couple of quarters? That will be very helpful.
Henry A. Fernandez: George, the -- everything remains very, very similar to what we've said in the past. The RMA business is a little more lumpy in its sales on a quarter-to-quarter basis than many other businesses. So, 1 quarter you're going to see significant sales relative to expectations, and the next quarter, maybe a little less relative to expectations. But the key to focus on clearly, not that quarter-to-quarter but are we still on track to certain level of growth in that business. The pipeline remains pretty healthy in this quarter, this current quarter that we're in and we feel pretty good about it and many of these segments that in the past have been a little bit weaker like hedge funds are coming back and the like. So we feel pretty good about it. Now again, it's lumpy and the like. In terms of competition, nothing really new have changed very dramatically. We still have a very good and leading position in this market. But clearly, there is competition and we deal with it and we go through the RFP process, we win most of those and we feel pretty good about where we are and where we're headed with this business.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And maybe just -- to expand on that point a little bit, Henry. Any change in how you view the long-term growth potential of that business? And maybe any sort of way to frame what you think the long-term growth rate is within RMA?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, we don't forecast at this point, especially in this recuperating environment, where we think they're going to head longer term. But we continue to believe very strongly that the demand for risk management analytics, on the buy side and the sell side will remain robust. It's just a question of ensuring that we're in front of those clients, that they free up those budgets to be able to install these systems and put them in place. If anything, we're beginning to see demand not only in the U.S. and in Europe, which is where we've been strong, but we have also deployed a number of senior people and increase our sales effort and product development effort in Asia. And that is beginning to show some very good activity -- though, obviously, we'll have to translate into sales and the like. We also are very -- continue to be very bullish in this business because of the regulatory framework, either regulations directly forcing people to have risk systems or because of that regulatory scrutiny, a lot of our clients wanting to have a more robust risk management framework to address their worries by their own clients. So we begin to see that in the risk management system. The other thing is that the regulation of certain aspects of the hedge fund industry has allowed us to come up with a lot of new products that there will be -- we're selling into that space and that's part of the revival of the hedge fund business as well.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. Just a last question for me. Just maybe in broad terms, maybe what you're seeing in terms of the pricing environment. I think -- what we've seen in the past is that the only segment that seems to have had some pressure there would be on the PMA side. Anything different that you've seen over the past quarter or so, maybe as it relates to the other segments?
Henry A. Fernandez: Nothing really different at all in terms of -- and the only segment that we have opted to do a small price increases have been index, as you know well. We could do it in RMA, but has adopted the policy that we only do it selectively, maybe in the future we'll change that, but that's where we are right now. One of the things that we have also done is scale our pricing to the value proposition. So in certain parts of the RMA business, the value proposition is very strong because you have large pools of money, needing risk management system, and therefore, pricing is going to strengthen there. And in the emerging manager segment, such as new hedge funds or -- and the like, we are pricing our products to be able to grow with them, so that we'll sell them a system that, over time, they pay us more. So that's an element as well. But in general, in terms of the overall picture, no major change on pricing.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore Partners.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: This is Rayna for David Togut. Could you tell us the drivers for your decline in your portfolio management retention rate?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. There are a number of things in the portfolio management analytics. The first thing to always think about is the state of the end market. The end market for this product is quantitative equity asset managers and the quantitative support of fundamental managers, mostly loan-only equity managers. So both of those segments have been relatively challenged for years now. The quantitative part since 2007 and the fundamental -- the quantitative support of fundamental managers since the beginning of the crisis. So there have been quite a lot of costs focused on that, quite a lot of paring down of headcount and expenses and so on and so forth. So we have adopted a strategy of helping our clients manage their business so that we're there with them when things are tough, and we're there with them, and benefit when things grow. So quite a lot this past quarter, something like 80%, 85% of the cancels in the PMA business have been down sales to existing clients as they're renewing contracts in order to help them navigate their cost issues and with a promise that when things get better, we're going to ride it out with them. So that's happening as well. Obviously, they're still the competition issue that we continue to face, but that's nothing new there, it's pretty manageable and the like. And the other thing is that this business, we believe, that hopefully, will start turning around and growing with the addition of a lot of new products that will create better need -- fulfill better needs to our clients and we have especially in this year, quite a lot of new proposals, a lot of new models are coming to the market. This year, we'll probably add more models than we've added in the last 5, 7 years. We've recently launched a new version of the portfolio manager platform, which we're pushing pretty hard and so on and so forth. So I give you 2 answers. One is, why the cancel and the state of that business, and then, secondly, what we think we can do to revive it.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Thanks for the insight. And second is -- and my second question is, what are your capital allocation priorities for the next 12 to 18 months? Is a dividend a possibility?
Robert Qutub: I think right now -- this is Bob, we've indicated the $200 million share buyback is what we're focused on right now. Annually, we'll take a look at what our capital allocation policy will be. But right now, we're committed to the $200 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just as a follow-up. How should we think about the trajectory of the retention rate and PMA for the rest of the year? I know first quarter historically has tended to be on the higher side.
Henry A. Fernandez: I think it's too early to tell at this point. I mean, we -- you may remember 1 year or so ago, maybe 1.5 years ago, we felt good because the business has stopped sliding and then we've returned it to growth only to see it dip down again. So we need to be cautious about this business. We feel good that we believe, if you think about the entire book, the entire run rate of this business, we believe that most of it has been repriced to the realities of the end markets and the realities of the cost pressures and the competitive landscape. But we can't really tell you for sure, but we feel that on the cancel front, we will see surprises. But quite a lot of the larger part of the book of business has been managed appropriately and has been repriced. So we keep focus on retention, quite heavily, that's a major focus of ours. But we are now beginning to turn even more attention to the sales efforts of not only the existing products and the recently launched products but also a lot of these new products that I just mentioned. So we were cautiously optimistic that over the next few quarters, we can to stabilize this business and at some point, begin to grow again. But again, I don't want to predict again what's happening here until we see it all happen.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then on the ETF side of the business, following the Vanguard move and then, recently, a couple of ProShares funds, not a lot of assets but, switching to FTSE. Could you talk about FTSE becoming a little bit more aggressive than they've been historically? Are they trying to undercut on pricing? And just what you're seeing there?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, there is no question that we have a predatory competitor out there, right, in FTSE? And they are aggressively trying to a lot of different things. But in reality, when we look at our entire relationships in ETFs around the world and our book of business, we feel very good about the leading and competitive position that we have both in terms of our tight relationships with ETF managers, but also the existing products and the new products that we're talking to them about. In the case of the ProShare, if funds that transfer to FTSE -- a couple of thoughts there. One is, they were not very big and obviously, as you know. But secondly and much more importantly, we have a very good relationship with ProShare and they did not want to make this move. But those funds were designed from the very beginning to be linked to the Vanguard fund, to be almost derivatives of the Vanguard fund. So as Vanguard switched the underlying index and their funds to FTSE, eventually, ProShares have no choice but to switch them. We do not think that there are too many of those products around the world, if any at all. So we believe this is a special case and -- particularly to ProShares. And they're sorry that, that is happening and we are as well, but we have a great relationship with ProShares.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Could you first just walk us through your thoughts on pricing for '13 in the index business and what exactly is baked into your index subscription run rate?
Robert Qutub: We've already gone out with our standard pricing increases that are based on -- relative to the market, that will be reflected in the run rate. No significant change on a year-over-year basis.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And during the quarter in PMA, you launched the new version of Barra Portfolio Manager. I know that's kind of been a staggered rollout here over the last few years. Now that it sounds like that product is more complete, do you see evidence that client interest is increasing? Or any evidence that run rate could begin to improve there?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. There are various goals that we have with Barra Portfolio Manager. The first goal is to ensure that those clients would like to migrate from a desktop-client-hosted solution, that is Aegis, to an MSCI-hosted ASP solution, which is Barra Portfolio Manager. So in some respects, that is a defensive move and may not translate into a lot of revenue, but should translate into high retention rates. The second goal is -- and by the way, there will be many clients that would want to continue to use Aegis, so that's also that we are preserving. A second goal for us is to expand the use case of the Barra Equity Models with not only the quantitative portfolio managers and the quantitative support fundamental managers but to begin to expand the universe of users to more lite-quant fundamental managers that will benefit from a tool that helps them understand the risk, the exemptive [ph] risk for their portfolio and helps them be able to optimize their portfolio and construct and manage their portfolio. So we're hoping to do that with this new software. We feel very good as the way it is now in this new version, which has significant back-testing capabilities. The buzz is very good around the industry. There are quite a lot of trials going on. But I think it's too early to tell whether this is going to lead to a lot of sales or not. We are being very thoughtful and very careful about the rollout of it in a way that it focuses on the first goal first of enhancing the Aegis revenue run rate and then, once we secure that, then begin to expand into new areas. So over time, for sure, we hope that it's going to lead to a lot of new sales. But I think the timing of that is still uncertain because our focus is on the first goal.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then just final question. As I look at your website here recently, it looked like you have considerably more job openings right now than you did 1 year ago, and I was curious, what if anything, we should read into that as it relates to the comp for the remainder of the year?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, as I've said in my remarks, I mean, to us, innovation, it means investment and an investment is mostly people. So we're stepping up the headcount additions, mostly in emerging market centers purely, but some in developed markets. I want to continue to emphasize that we do all of this with a very keen eye on maintaining a tight grip on expenses in the company so that none of it has significant or meaningful effect on our profitability. We want to have the cake and eat it, too. We want to continue to grow and make investments at the same time that we remain a highly profitable company. And we've been able to do that successfully, including with this major opening that we have. Yes, we -- purely, the low-level [ph] openings are a little higher than it was last year because we're ramping up those centers around the world. And we started well in the first quarter, but we need to ramp up in the second and third quarter. And the implications of that are -- on the cost are, we think, they're highly manageable in the way that we've always done in the past.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I'm not showing any further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments.
Henry A. Fernandez: So just to conclude, a lot of our remarks, we feel good about where we are in the financial results given the environment. We feel good about the positioning of our company for further growth in the future, not only organic, but a little bit of bolt-on acquisitions if they come. And we feel good about the level of profitability and the capital allocation decisions that we have made. So all of that will continue. And we thank you for your interest in this call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your MSCI Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Saeed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release describing our results for fourth quarter and full year 2012, and a copy of that release may be viewed on our website at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You'll also find on our website, a slide presentation that we have prepared to accompany this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements on our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and other SEC filings. Today's earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: lease exit charge, restructuring costs and non-recurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EPS also excludes the amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and debt repayment and refinancing expenses. Please refer to today's earnings release and the relevant slides in the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will be referring to run rate frequently in our discussion this morning, so let me remind you again that our run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking revenues for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months, assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETFs license to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to Table 10 in our press release for a detailed explanation. I will now turn the call over to Bob Qutub.
Robert Qutub: Thank you, Edings, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call. Earlier this morning, MSCI reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012. Our operating results were highlighted by another strong quarter for our Performance and Risk segment with the index and ESG subscription run rate increasing by 25%, aided by the acquisition of IPD, and 11% organic growth. Our Government segment continued to make progress on our path to sustainable growth. While there remains work to be done, we are pleased with the trend to results we have reported in the past 3 quarters. MSCI's results benefited from strong net inflows in the MSCI-linked ETFs during the fourth quarter. The vast majority of these flows came after Vanguard announced their decision to switch indices for certain ETFs. Since the switch was announced, MSCI has seen the assets under management and other ETFs linked to MSCI indices increase, as MSCI-linked ETFs gained almost 2/3 of all flows into U.S. listed cross-border ETFs. That kind of voted confidence in the value of MSCI indices is extremely gratifying. The run rate of our portfolio management analytics business, which accounted for 11% of our total, continued to decline with much of that decline in run rate can be traced to foreign currency moves and the impact of product swaps, the combination of tough conditions for our client and ongoing price competition improved to be a strong headwind. We do not believe that we are losing ground to our competitors and we will work to continue to harvest and stabilize this important product line. Another topic I want to highlight is the deployment of our capital. Over the course of 2012, we did a great deal of talking to our Board, investors and others about how we can deploy our capital to support our medium and long-term growth while balancing the needs of our shareholders. I'll review the details of how we use our capital in 2012 later in the call but the result of that process was a balanced approach that funded our internal investment, enabled us to take advantage of limited strategic opportunities and return capital. Now let's get into the numbers. MSCI reported fourth quarter net income of $54.5 million, representing an increase of 22% over fourth quarter 2011. Revenues were $247.1 million, up 9% from fourth quarter 2011, adjusted EBITDA was $116.6 million, up 12% year-over-year with adjusted EPS rising 16% to $0.52. For the full year, MSCI reported net income of $184.2 million, an increase of 6% over 2011. Revenues were $950.1 million, an increase of 5% from 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was up $434.5 million, up 4%. And adjusted EPS was up $1.94, up 5%. Our fourth quarter revenue growth by segment was led by our Performance and Risk segment which reported revenue growth of $18.4 million or 9% driven by higher growth in index and ESG and risk management analytics revenues, partially offset by a decline in Portfolio Management Analytics, and Energy and Commodity Analytics. Our Government segment revenues rose $2.6 million or 9%. On revenue type, overall quarterly subscription revenue grew by 6% over the fourth quarter 2011, or by 5% organically, and asset-based fees rose by 23%. On a run rate basis, our total subscription business grew by 10% to $840 million. That growth was aided by the acquisition of IPD, which added 35 -- excuse me, $39.5 million. On an organic basis, our subscription run rate grew by 5%, led by an 11% increase in index and ESG subscription, 8% growth in governance and 4% growth in risk management analytics. This was partially offset by run rate declines in Portfolio Management Analytics, and Energy and Commodity Analytics. On a sequential basis, run rate grew by 1% organically. MSCI's growth in run rate continues to be impacted by a tough selling environment and by a seasonal uptick in cancels. Total sales of $37 million were down 13% from fourth quarter of 2011, and subscription sales declined 16%. Our overall retention rate remains solid at 85% for the quarter and 90% for the full year. Just as a reminder, nearly 1/3 of our annual renewals come due in the fourth quarter and as a result, we have generally recorded the highest levels of cancellations in that quarter leading in turn to a sequential decline in retention rate. Given the seasonality of the fourth quarter retention rate, we believe that the year-over-year comparison is more appropriate in looking at the sequential trend. Now let's take a look at the performance of our 4 major product lines. Starting with our index and ESG subscription products, revenues there grew by $10 million or 14% with IPD contributing $3.6 million to growth. Run rate grew 25% to $338 million or by 11% on an organic basis. We saw an uptick in sales in Europe, offset by weaker demand in other regions, especially the United States. We continued to benefit from increasing sales of ESG products and overall retention rates stayed strong at 90% in the fourth quarter and 93% for the full year. Before I get into the discussion of asset-based fee run rates, let me clarify that we continue to reflect the Vanguard revenues in our reported P&L, along with the related AUMs as a measure of performance. However, for a policy reflecting no cancels, we have adjusted our run rate, which is a forward-looking measure as of the third quarter 2012 to reflect the loss of the Vanguard ETFs. The AUMs of the Vanguard ETFs was, as you may recall, $131 billion at the end of third quarter 2012, with an estimated run rate of $24 million. Our asset-based fee revenues run rate benefited from a combination of solid market performance and strong inflows in the ETFs linked to MSCI indices. Revenues rose 23% on the back of an increase in overall assets under management and higher revenues from non-ETF passive products. Asset-based fee run rates rose 6% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $127 million. If we also exclude the run rate attributable to the Vanguard ETFs from the company's run rate at the end of the fourth quarter 2011, our annual asset-based fee run rate growth would have been 25%. There was over $402 billion of assets under management in ETFs linked to MSCI indices at the end of December 2012, up 33% year-over-year, and 11% from the end of December 2012. $138 billion of that AUM was in the Vanguard ETFs, leaving $264 billion in AUM and those ETFs that will remain linked to MSCI indices. Excluding the Vanguard ETFs, our average pricing on MSCI-linked ETFs remain constant with third quarter at 3.7 basis points. I want to spend a moment discussing net flows in ETFs linked to our indices. For the full year 2012, those ETFs saw a total of $57 billion of net inflows, equivalent to 19% of the total AUM at the beginning of 2012. In the fourth quarter alone, ETFs linked to MSCI indices experienced $26 billion of net inflows and only 15% of those flows, or $3.9 billion, were into those ETFs that will switch indices. So the big driver of our sequential run rate growth was the performance of and flows into those ETFs that will remain linked with MSCI. Speaking of those Vanguard ETFs, the transition is underway. Earlier this week, we reported that our January month end balance for AUM and ETFs linked to MSCI indices was $334 billion, down from $402 billion at the end of December. The latest balance reflects the migration of approximately $100 billion and 8 ETFs. As of January 31, there was approximately $48 million of AUMs and 14 ETFs, which remain to be transitioned. The remaining ETFs account for approximately 25% of the $24 million run rate we identified in October. Our risk management analytics revenues rose 7% year-over-year, and run rate rose 4% to $262 million. RMA sales were $11 million during the quarter, essentially in line with the levels that we have seen all year but down more than 20% from the fourth quarter of 2011. We experienced strong interest in our hedge fund reporting products and solid demand from banks and broker-dealers offset by continued softness from asset managers with slower sales to pension funds. Cancellation trends remain broadly stable as our retention rate rose to 84% for the fourth quarter and remained 89% for the full year, while recently we spent $23.5 million to acquire InvestorForce. Our investment in InvestorForce will open up new opportunities for our RMAs to offer risk performance products to pension funds. We had a tough quarter in our PMA product line with revenues down 5%. Run rate declined 7% year-over-year to $110 million, with most of that decline coming in the fourth quarter. There are several factors behind the decline in run rate, changes in FX rates, most notably, the weakening of the Japanese Yen, lowered run rate by $1.8 million during the fourth quarter. The business was also impacted by product swaps into our risk management analytics product. These swaps lowered our PMA run rate by $3 million year-over-year, including almost $1.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2012. You can see this as a difference between our annual aggregate retention rate of 78% and our core retention rate of 84%. Taken together, these 2 factors resulted in a net impact to PMA rate of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter 2012, or just half of the $6 million sequential decline with net cancels accounting for the remaining. Looking beyond those FX changes and the impact of product swaps, the PMA business remains very competitive. The new products we have launched are having an impact. The struggles of asset managers broadly and quantitative asset managers more specifically continue to have a dampening effect on our sales. We see these conditions continuing through the first quarter of 2013. On a very positive note, we are encouraged by the progress being made by our governance segment, which reported a 9% increase in revenues. Governance run rate grew by 8% to $117 million. Growth in our governance business continues to be driven by the success of our executive compensation data and analytics products and by an improvement in retention rate. The core proxy research and voting market remain competitive where we saw a marked improvement in our retention rate from this product, which is an indication that the efforts we have made to improve the quality of our product and the level of service we provide are being appreciated by our clients. Now let's turn to our expenses. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA rose by 12% to $116.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our adjusted EBITDA expense rose only by 7% to $131 million, with all of that growth coming from higher compensation expense. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 46% in the fourth quarter 2011, driven by an increase in revenues and strong expense management. Please note that we expect our EBITDA margin to decline sequentially in the first quarter as a result of the impact of the IPD and InvestorForce acquisitions, both of which have lower margins, the impact of lower asset-based fees resulting from Vanguard's index switch, as well as normal sequential increase in costs, including the flowing through of inflationary compensation increases and seasonally higher benefit costs. Compensation expense rose by 10% to $93 million. The increasing compensation expense was driven by an increase in overall compensation levels and benefits expense and by the addition of IPD. In addition, the change in compensation expense was exacerbated by MSCI's decision in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reduce its accrued bonus expense, which lowered compensation costs in that period by $3 million. Also the addition of 312 employees of IPD slowed the progress we are making on leveraging our low-cost [indiscernible] but even after factoring in those additions, we still increased the percentage of our headcount in those centers to 41% from 39% a year ago, but down sequentially from 44% in the third quarter. While we're on the subject of compensation, let me remind you that MSCI is now fully amortized with non-recurring stock based-compensation issued in the wake of the RiskMetrics acquisition. Non-compensation expenses declined by $1 million, or 2%, as a result of lower IT spending and recruiting expenses, which helped to offset the impact of higher occupancy expense and the impact of IPD non-compensation expense. MSCI's tax rate increased to 38.3% in fourth quarter 2012. Driving the uptick in quarterly taxes was a $1.7 million charge to cover our portion of additional tax liabilities incurred when we were a part of Morgan Stanley. We also incurred certain acquisition charges related to IPD that are not tax-deductible, which raised our effective rate. We expect our operating tax rate for 2012, net of discrete benefits or expenses, to be in the 34% to 34.5% range. Now turning to our balance sheet. We generated $347 million in operating cash flow in 2012, benefiting from our profitability and increased working capital efficiencies of $52 million. We used that money to fund our organic investments in our analytics platform and index brand. We spent $45 million in CapEx, and invested $125 million in IPD. We also returned a total of $324 million of invested capital in the form of a $224 million reduction in debt and in December, through the $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, which is part of the authorized $300 million share buyback in December. With DSR in place, we did not utilize any of that additional authorization as of the end of the fourth quarter. Just a reminder about the mechanics of the accelerated share repurchase agreement we signed in December. We paid $100 million to Morgan Stanley on the day of the agreement. They delivered to us 2.2 million shares, which we withdrew from our share count. The balance of the shares to be delivered to us, if any, is expected no later than July 2013 and is based on daily average volume weighted share price during the repurchase period. MSCI may be required in certain limited circumstances to deliver shares or, at its option, pay cash at the settlement time. Because of the timing of DSR and the reduction of our share count have little impact on fourth quarter or 2012 results but it will have a modest benefit to our EPS growth in 2013. Looking ahead, in the spirit of providing more insight on our capital deployment, we ended 2012 with $254 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with approximately $84 million of that cash held offshore. We have already invested $23 million -- $23.5 million to acquiring InvestorForce, and under the terms of our current loan, we are scheduled to repay $44 million in 2013 of our outstanding debt in 4 $11 million quarterly increment. And after an uptick in 2012, we expect our capital expenditures to be lower than 2013 in the range of $30 million to $35 million. And of course, we have the authorization granted by the Board to repurchase up to $200 million of our shares. Now let me turn it over to Henry for some additional comments.
Henry A. Fernandez: Thanks, Bob. Before I speak to you about some of the initiatives we have underway for 2013, I would like to reflect a bit more on the past year. The operating environment was difficult for much of 2012, and the fourth quarter was no exception. MSCI experienced a slowdown in sales across our major product line as we saw clients delaying their decision-making process. This trend, which began in the middle of 2011, remained constant throughout 2012. Throughout that timeframe, however, our overall retention rate has remained largely stable, a trend that has also continued in the fourth quarter. So in our view, we think we are experiencing a broad hesitation on the part of the participants in the financial markets to make significant budgetary decisions. We continue to believe that this hesitation is largely a function of macroeconomic uncertainty and some of the more micro challenges faced by segments of the investment and banking industry. We believe that both confidence and spending will rebound at some point. It is important to keep in mind that MSCI's business is evolving, financial markets are becoming more integrated, both globally and across asset classes, increasing the complexity our clients face. Clients and regulators are demanding more transparency, both internally across portfolios and externally between managers. At the same time the cost of processing data is dropping fast, which is going to drive innovation and increase the value of unique data sets and analytical tools. All of these factors are driving underlying demand for tools, which can provide insight and linkage around performance and risks for single asset class and multi-asset class investors and managers. It is our goal at MSCI to meet that demand and to provide those tools. These same factors are also driving our need to invest both organically and through acquisitions. So at MSCI, we're not sitting still waiting for market conditions to turn. We are taking a proactive but balanced approach to our investment plan. To meet the needs of our clients, we made sizable investments in our products and services over the course of 2012. We have consistently added to our sales and sales support organizations, which we think has had a very positive impact on our retention rates. On the product development side, we are benefiting from a range of new products that were launched throughout 2012. At the same time, we're working hard to limit the impact of these investments on profitability by leveraging our low-cost centers and our technology and keeping a very tight rein on discretionary spending in the company. In our indexed unit, we have continued to expand our offering of risk premium and other strategy indices, which integrate the intelligence of our Barra analytics with a compressive market view of our global indices. We also introduced economic exposure indices, which have generated a lot of interest from clients who wish to know more about where the companies in their portfolio make their money. In our risk unit, we significantly upgraded the hardware platform underlying our risk analytics in order to expand the processing power and flexibility we offer our clients. That upgrade gives us a more robust infrastructure and scalable architecture. We also rolled out new services to help hedge funds meet disclosure requirements to investors and regulators. We have also taken steps to integrate Barra's equity and multi-asset class insights into the risk metrics, risk management platforms. Finally, we continue to work on broadening our product offering to include multi-asset class performance attribution analytics in addition to risk management analytics, which is a key step in linking performance and risks for multi-asset class investors. In governance, we have invested to expand the breadth of the compensation data analytics products and services that we provide to include more companies and in more countries. We also added to our sales and client service organization, improved the stability and performance of our proxy voting system and upgraded the look of our proxy research offering. In portfolio management analytics, we continue to launch new models, and will shortly enhance our Barra Portfolio Manager software by adding back -- by adding critical portfolio back testing functionality that is much in demand by our clients. In addition to making this important organic investment, we also invested $125 million to acquire Investment Property Databank or IPD. To understand why IPD fits with MSCI's strategy, it is necessary to go back to what I said earlier. MSCI's goal is to provide mission-critical investment decision support tools that link performance and risk across portfolios that are invested in a single asset class and those composed of multiple asset classes. In order to provide insight about multiple asset class portfolios, we need to bring together best of breed tools for measuring performance and risks in each asset class. IPD's unique data indices and analytics and a strong client base broadened our performance measurement tools to include commercial real estate and will help us bring additional insight and global comparability to the managers of this asset and the institutional investors who fund them. At the beginning of 2013, we spent $24 million to acquire InvestorForce, which provides pension fund consultants with critical portfolio performance measurement tools to service their pension fund clients. This acquisition will deepen our penetration into this important part of the pension fund community and will give us a platform to which we can add data, analytics and especially risk measurement tools into that platform to serve pension fund clients. The combination of InvestorForce platform, the current tools and the incremental insight that MSCI can provide should enable these consultants to significantly expand the quality of advice they provide to their pension funds and other asset owner clients, further embedding MSCI in the investment process. We will continue to invest in a proactive but balanced fashion in 2013. As always, we will be investing in new products, including additional risk premium and strategy indices; new governance tools and enhanced risk and performance analytics across our various asset classes. We will also be making additional investments in our client outreach and distribution channels in order to expand and deepen our relationship with our largest client, extend our geographic reach, especially with emerging market clients, and bolster our client services. We're also expanding our marketing and advertising efforts, especially to financial advisors in the U.S. as we seek to continue to build our brand and make them aware of the many factors that differentiate MSCI's global indices from those of the country and regional players or other low-price new entrants. Finally, we will be making additional investments in our technology infrastructure and are launching a multiyear effort to evolve our 2 existing risk management software platforms, BarraOne and RiskManager, by knitting them together closer over time. Many of these investments will extend beyond 2013. But as I said before, we will be working very hard to ensure that this investment do not significantly affect the levels of profitability of our company. These investments are a part of a larger financial strategy of balanced capital deployment that Bob described earlier. We are fortunate that our strong cash flow will enable us to make organic investments, both on acquisitions like IPD and InvestorForce, while at the same time, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. We view the $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement and the increment of $200 million share repurchase authorization that we announced in December as the primary means for that return of capital to shareholders. Let's go ahead now and take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Georgios Mihalos from Crédit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a couple of questions, you guys referenced the difficult selling environment that's been going on for about 1.5 years now. Are you sensing any sort of change in the environment early in the year, whether better or worse? And just to kind of jump on that point, what do you think are sort of -- how do you think about the long-term growth prospects for the risk management business in terms of growth and kind of the competitive profile that's out there?
Robert Qutub: I think, on the first part -- I'll take the first one. Indications are we're seeing a continuation, George, on -- in terms of the pipeline remaining strong. It's just getting corporation to continue to spend the money. We indicated in the past quarter, we saw the cancels remain kind of seasonally reflective of what they've been before. We're looking at the macroeconomic environment to get more certainty. I think that Henry talked to it. And on that point, Henry, from your perspective, if you want to offer something up on that?
Henry A. Fernandez: We are hopeful that the current rally in equity markets around the world and some lifting of the macroeconomic uncertainties will eventually benefit us. We have seen very, very early indications of some of that in the tone of dialogue with clients but nothing really to report. And we typically lag, companies like MSCI lag on the way up and lag on the way down in our subscription business. Obviously, the environment is beneficial to us on the AUM for the ETFs and other types of products, but we're currently not sitting still. We keep pushing ahead in many of the things that we're doing in order to see if we can push hard on sales and benefit from that this year and obviously maintain the stable retention rates that we've enjoyed in the past. With respect to the RMA business, as we've said in the past, this is a business that is always lumpy. It is -- there are some quarters in which it's going to be better and some quarters where it's not going to look as great. And I think the fourth quarter of last year was one of those in which many of the sales that were in the pipeline had slipped. We are pretty hopeful and confident that the pipeline remains healthy. If the macroeconomic uncertainty lifts more, we may be able to see some of those deals closing sooner rather than later, but it's too early to tell. We're also very confident that the fundamental demand for Risk Management Analytics around the world in all the various classes and client segments that we serve is still strong and healthy, from hedge funds to our pension plans and other forms of asset owners to asset managers, et cetera. But it's clearly a question of converting that interest on those trials and those elements of the pipeline to actual sales. There have be times in which it's a little easier and other times in which it's more difficult. But I believe, and I think all of our colleagues believe that the fundamental demand for risk management continues to be pretty strong across the board. I think the other thing that, in general, that I'd like to add is that, interestingly enough or funny enough, quite a lot of the difficulty converting sales to -- in the pipeline to actual orders has been in the U.S. And we've been fortunate that our business in Europe, even though clearly affected by the sovereign debt crisis there has performed well. So as we see some of this uncertainty lifting politically and budgetary in the U.S., maybe we'll benefit from that in terms of our overall sales.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the portfolio analytics side, I think you referenced a sizable portion of the decline in the run rate being sourced from product swaps to BarraOne specifically. How far along do you think we are in that process? I think, in the release, you mentioned some fixed income products. I guess the old Cosmos converting to BarraOne. Is that essentially done now? And how should we think about pricing in that business going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think on the product swaps between Aegis and BPM into BarraOne will continue. And a lot of the reasons why that is the case is, one, BarraOne is fairly advanced in its functionality for both risk management and certain amount of portfolio management. That's the product line that we have been putting more investments in and so forth -- so on and so forth. So therefore, it is logical to see more -- some clients who have certain amount of risk analysis and risk management capabilities in their front equity portfolio management office put that in BarraOne. So we'll see some of that continue. That may get abated over time as we develop Barra Portfolio Manager more, and therefore, may benefit from that. Secondly is that there is, in certain parts of the world, especially in Europe and parts of Japan, a bit more of an integration going on between the front portfolio management office and the middle risk management office. And therefore, we may see some product swaps between Aegis, for example, and obviously Cosmos in fixed income, into BarraOne because people in those areas would like to have one system serving the front office of portfolio management and the middle office for risk management. So that's another aspect of product swaps that will continue. To be frank, to us, we're indifferent. At many times, the product swaps that take place between PMA and RMA are done at an uptick to sales in RMA, and a lot of this description that we have in terms of RMA and PMA is, at times, artificial. It may be confusing or misleading over time, but that's the way we've done it so far.
Robert Qutub: Yes, and George, and there's not much left on Cosmos to that specific point. [indiscernible]
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And just last question for me. You guys referenced investments in '13. Just sort of, in aggregate, should we be thinking that those investments will be roughly on par or at the same level of investment in 2012?
Robert Qutub: I think they will be, we're continuing an upward trend, George, we're trying to look more organically in what we're doing. We see that leveraging our existing platform. Henry cited ones that occurred in 2012, we've got more that -- that were completed in 2012 in data centers. But as we go into 2013, we're looking at the network and the platform. So we see that as an ongoing trend that's positive. It leverages our existing platform and obviously, those type of investments have great payback.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore Partners.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: A couple of quick questions. First, on client retention, even if we adjust for the negative FX and the product swap, wouldn't client retention in Portfolio Management Analytics still be down pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis?
Robert Qutub: We've seen -- like we said, we've seen pricing pressures come in through. The competitive market has been tough. We're not necessarily losing ground per se, but these contracts come up for repricing, it's competitive, there's other entrants in the market, that makes it challenging. But like I said earlier, the bulk of the decline in the run rate was driven by product swaps we talked a little but more extensively that Henry referred to, as well as the FX.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And just on the energy and commodity analytics, which was down about, I guess, [indiscernible] percentage points year-over-year, can you talk about the underlying drivers of that decline in client retention? To what extent is that one-time or something sustainable?
Robert Qutub: You're seeing structural changes in the market with the OCC's exchanges and those things going on. Those are things that have to work themselves out over time. We continue to work on the models, we continue to upgrade and move through it. As certain things sort themselves out, we'll have a better position going forward.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I see. And then can you update us on the relationship with BlackRock? They said on their recent earnings call that they were very pleased with MSCI, and yet they want to keep their costs down as low as possible. So how are those discussions proceeding? Can you sustain the pricing with BlackRock over time?
Robert Qutub: I think, as we have said over and over and over again, we have a very strong and close relationship with all of BlackRock, but obviously, in this case specifically, iShares. The level of collaboration and discussion that we've had with them intensified quite significantly in the last quarter as we were trying to ensure that we were serving our mutual clients, it's mostly institutional clients, in their transition from many of the Vanguard funds to the iShares funds. So that relationship is very strong, and it continues to get stronger and the like. So I don't anticipate no significant changes of that. If anything, we continue to launch a lot of new products together. I don't think any month goes by without iShares introducing new MSCI-linked ETFs in the U.S., but in other locations around the world. And we're looking at the map of the world in terms of where are areas in which we are not yet doing as much as we should be doing. Ocana [ph] is one example of those and therefore, we are pushing hard together to see what else we can be launching together in many of these other places.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Final question for me on capital allocation. You've shown a lot more flexibility on the score in the last few months with the ASR. Should we expect you to start paying a dividend at some point in the near future?
Robert Qutub: I think Henry gave pretty clear guidance. With the $200 million authorized buyback, that's our vehicle right now, to return our capital back to our investors and shareholders.
Henry A. Fernandez: And then we also have -- I don't think the flexibility, so to speak, around the fourth quarter was necessarily anything new. I think what we did throughout 2012, and many of our shareholders and analysts understand that we engaged in a discussion as to what is it that the right capital deployment of the company ought to be. We engaged our Board intensely during this summer in a strategy about the overall direction of the company and the areas we wanted to make investments, we worked pretty hard in creating a budgetary process in the Fall. And therefore, all of that ended up coinciding towards the end of the year for the end result that you saw. We always had a very significant amount of effort going on, on capital allocation and capital deployment in the company in terms of what is the right balance between organic investment, bolt-on acquisitions some pay down of debt if necessary and return of capital. So I think we achieved the right balance, we're pretty happy with it and I don't think we're going to add dramatically to that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You typically implement the annual price increase in May, so I think this is my last chance to ask about it before next quarter. Can you give us some color on what you're thinking on the index side of the business? Is it the usual sort of 3% to 5%? And in the portfolio analytics side, is that still not really expecting price increases there because of the tough environment?
Henry A. Fernandez: I don't think this year will be that significant the way we're looking at pricing in the index business. We haven't made any final decisions at this point. But so far a lot of our discussion have been not dramatically different. With respect to pricing on the RMA business, I think that, that's another -- I don't think there's going to be any significant or substantive changes to the pricing that we have on that product line in 2013 as it relates to 2012. And in PMA, I think the pricing there is looking at every client that renews. We want to keep the business with those clients. Sometimes we add functionality and there's an uptick and part of their -- many times in which the renewal gets done at a lower price point. So that will probably continue in 2013.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. That's great. And just one other question on portfolio management analytics. You talked about the tough macro and customers not really wanting to spend. Are you changing your strategy at all in this business in particular? I know you mentioned some of the initiatives from a distribution side, et cetera, but is there anything in this business, in particular, that you're going to be changing?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think, a lot of it is a continuation and mainly -- sometimes an acceleration of all the strategic moves that we're making in this business. One is how do we ensure our tools are in a lot of different software platforms, not only ours but other vendors. So we've done that and accelerated that. Secondly, how do we ensure we keep launching quite a lot of new risk models. And a lot of the sale that came in 2012 were because of these new risk models. And we have more -- many more risk models coming out in 2013 as well. Three, is the continued enhancement of Barra Portfolio Manager. This newer release that is coming out in the next few months of Barra Portfolio Manager is a very important one because it gives a great deal of back testing functionality to portfolio analysis. So that's -- there's one release in the next few months and another one towards the end of the year that continues to enhance that software and make it look and behave a lot more like Aegis, which is obviously desktop, older technology. So we're doing that. And I think, in addition to that, we're getting extremely close to clients in terms of training clients and client service and understanding what they're trying to do and how they use their tools, customize many of the tools that we provide to them, that's another significant effort. So I think it's a continuation but I wouldn't say an acceleration in 2013 of a lot of what we've been doing in the past. That's not to say that necessarily, the business or the environment or the client base will improve dramatically but we're hoping that these efforts that we have in place continue to soften any kind of problems and at some point, turn the business around.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And just one last one for me. Can you talk about your strategy for the sales force this year? How much would you expect to increase it by? And which areas are you going to bulk up and are there areas that you're going to scale down?
Henry A. Fernandez: I don't think we're scaling down anything on the sales organization. If anything, now, there is quite a significant incremental expansion of our client organization in many fronts. We're adding sales people in all of these centers where we operate. We're opening up more centers to go into -- deeper into other our client bases in Canada. We're pushing hard in Taiwan. We're pushing hard in many of the emerging markets. We've created a dedicated sales force for the emerging markets of EMEA, Eastern Europe, Russia, Middle East, Turkey and Sub-Saharan Africa. There's money there, there are big sovereign wealth funds there that we're not covering as effectively, so we're pushing hard on that. We are adding to our consultants, these are the people that help train our clients on our analytics. And we're establishing larger client service centers in the emerging markets, adding into Monterrey, in Budapest and Mumbai, in Shanghai. But especially, we're adding significantly to the client service team in Manila. We established a front there that we didn't have before and that's also something that we're expanding on. We're going to have a night shift there to cover the world as well. All of these efforts have been very, very effective in keeping our retention stable. Don't underestimate the challenges that are facing investment organizations wanting to cut costs and the like. And the reason, one of the primary reasons why our retention rates have remained stable is because of a lot of these client service and consultant outreach that we have and we're using quite a lot of technology to do that. And we're positioning -- we're -- in terms of the sales additions, we are trying to grow faster if we can. And it positions us also extremely well that when a lot of this uncertainty lifts and the client's budget begin to get released, we'll be there to capture significant upside in growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Raymond James.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: A couple of housekeeping questions if I might. The first, I just want to double check if we have on the index and ESG revenue run rate, the subscription organic growth at 11%, the AUM at 6%, what was the total division organic growth for the run rate on an organic basis?
Robert Qutub: For the overall subscription run rate or just on the index and ESG?
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: The latter, just on the index and ESG. On an organic...
Robert Qutub: Organic was 11% on the overall.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: So was -- it was subscription at 11%, right? And then...
Robert Qutub: Subscription was 10% overall. And so the organic -- on an organic basis, it grew by 5%.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. But I'm saying, for -- if you take the index and ESG piece and you look at the run rate and you look at it just organic for that, it looks like subscription organic within index and ESG was 11%. And it looks like AUM was up 6%, and that's all organic. I just want to double check the total subscription -- sorry, the total index and ESG revenue run rate organic growth? If it's in the slide, just point me to it. I didn't see it.
Robert Qutub: Bill, good little feedback. I just want to make sure we're clear on it.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Not a problem. And then, I wanted to ask if you have updated your thinking around a target debt level?
Robert Qutub: We are always evaluating. As Henry said, we talked to our Board and our investors, we're looking at -- constantly looking at our capital structure. As you know, we've got the $850 million outstanding, we've got scheduled payments of $44 million this year, the step up that matures in 2017. We'll be evaluating our levels of debt along with all other factors that would be a part of our invested capital for the company here, but we're always looking at it.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the acquisition front, just wanted to ask if you felt you had any holes that you needed to fill, whether you are still aggressively reviewing opportunities? I just want to get your thoughts there.
Henry A. Fernandez: Bill, we are always reviewing opportunities that are what I would call acceleration of organic investment through acquisitions in our backyard, the same product line and on the like. So that continues. And largely, these are largely things that are bolt-on. We're not proactively looking at anything that is big or transformational, anything like that. You never know when those things come. But a lot of what we're trying to look is what specific holes do we have. In the asset classes per se, in the single asset classes, we feel pretty good about equities. Hedge funds for a bit, obviously real estate. We are actually -- good that you asked, we're actually about to announce a consultation process with our clients on private equities. We've been working with another vendor on private equities to see if we can join forces to create private equity indices on performance and risk management systems for that asset class. So that also is ongoing. I think, clearly, the area where we are strong for multi-asset classes is fixed income but we're not as strong in fixed income as a single asset class. I don't think we're going to launch fixed income indices at this point. We are having a good partnership with Barclays on ESG for fixed income but we're not going to go into that space directly. And I think, we haven't been able to earmark investment for fixed income Portfolio Management Analytics. That's an area that we keep looking but I'm not sure that -- we keep saying that every year, I'm not sure we're going to do anything necessarily, unless we find something interesting at the right price.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: In the ETF business, just curious to get your thoughts on why the MSCI emerging market's ETF EAM has seen such a good pickup inflows while some of the other ETFs, I mean, some of the other ETFs with Vanguard products that switched to FTSE haven't suffered as much or have actually continued to see inflows? So just curious to get your take there? And then also, what's your sense of how sustainable the trends in the EAM ETF are?
Henry A. Fernandez: Sorry, your second question, what's...
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: It was just how sustainable do you think the trends in the MSCI emerging market's ETF are, I guess, relative to the competition?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. No, I think, what happened in the last quarter, since the announcement by Vanguard, is a testimony and a complete understanding of what we've been saying since the announcement of the Vanguard switch. And that is MSCI is the leading index for global institutional investors in the way they allocate the assets and give out mandates for their portfolios. And it's just not only American but European and Asian, institutional investors of all types. So when the announcement was made, you saw that there were a lot of institutional investors around the world that had found their way into Vanguard ETFs because they wanted to be invested in an MSCI index. And when they saw those ETFs switching indices, they looked around to what other ETFs with MSCI indices were available and you saw that massive switch that took place in the fourth quarter and continues today. Now, this was very pronounced, even more so in the emerging markets because if MSCI is strong in terms of -- as an index in terms of general investment in all markets, it is strongest as an index of the emerging market. We have a very pronounced reputation in market share in indices that cover the emerging markets. So that was it. The other part of it is that the Vanguard emerging market ETF was the largest of all the ETFs -- the quarterly [ph] ETF that were being switched to another index. And therefore, it is likely and logical to have seen the largest amount of assets in that ETF going to iShares and others. So I think that, that's the explanation. Now that trend continues. Obviously, it may not continue at the same pace that it did in the fourth quarter because there are diminishing returns as to how much of that money really switches but it does continue today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Ditmire from Macquarie.
Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research: My question is how firm is your conviction at the product portfolio in a broad sense? And what I mean is index risk, portfolio analytics and governance is the right product set to take advantage of the next step turn in client demand when it materializes? In particular, have management moves to decentralize overhead functions like finance over the last year and push some of that overhead management into the segments, has that given you a better flexibility to make the most of your options in case you felt that one of the units would enjoy special synergies with a strategic partner, et cetera?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think, one way to think about our business, I mean, -- let me back up. The way we describe our business typically is in the form of index and risk and portfolio and governance and all of that. The other way to describe it, which is more logical, because that's what we're trying to achieve, is to say what are all the things that we're doing for the equity investment asset class? And put aside the brands and all of that, but what are we doing? So we create performance measurements in the form indices. We create performance attribution models. We create the risk analysis. And we create portfolio construction and portfolio optimization and so on and so forth. And we create -- we overlay a form of ESG investing on that equity -- on those equity portfolios and we have tools that bought -- that people bought their shares on those equity portfolios. So that's the vast majority of what we do. The vast majority of what we do is very synergistic because the infrastructure, all the databases, and our understanding of the companies, understanding of corporate events and corporate actions and the growth of those companies, the value of those companies and all of that is the same underlying structure that goes into an index or into a risk model or in an ESG or whatever. At the front-end, our distribution people are talking to the same people. They're talking to equity portfolio managers, they're talking to chief investment officers for equities, the head analysts for equities and so on and so forth. And therefore, it is highly, highly synergistic. We -- our view is that in a multi-asset class world in which all these asset classes are really converging with one another and the asset owner doesn't look at a single asset class. The asset owner wants to look at a combined portfolio. I think that saying that we can be a company that only does indices or only does things for the equity portfolio management is a dangerous place to be. You have -- for sure, for the asset owner, which is ultimately one dictating what happens at the asset manager level, so you have to go to the asset owner and provide them a comprehensive solution to risks and performance of their multi-asset class segments, in equities and fixed income and in alternatives. You have to provide that. And in order to do that, you have to be best-of-breed in each one of the asset classes. You have to be best-of-breed in equities. We're okay in fixed income but that's an area that needs development. We clearly are becoming -- will become very good at real estate, in risk and performance with the same on IPD. We clearly -- this consultation is successful in private equities and we are already doing quite a lot in risk analysis of hedge funds. So all of that is highly synergistic when you sit down with an asset owner, when you sit down with the managers of those assets. If you go see the CIO of a European asset management company, they want to talk to us about what can we do for them in their real estate portfolios and their equity portfolio and their fixed income portfolio, and these are all tools that are very similar to one another. How you measure risk and how you measure performance is the same similar tools, the same approach, the same philosophy in each one of them. So that's what we're trying to build at MSCI. And therefore, the holes that may exist over this long journey are holes that are either because the particular area is not price attractive, fixed income indices for example in the past haven't been a place where you make money, so we stay away from that. At some point, we will make money, but we stay away from them. And areas in which we can execute rapidly. So that's kind of the direction of what we're taking in all of this.
Robert Qutub: And to further your point, your opening question, we have a lot of integrated infrastructure whether it's from how we support product lines, whether it's from the functional units like finance that are in data support, those have been quite integrated.
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, thank you very much everyone. Is that the last call?
Operator: I'm showing no further questions.
Robert Qutub: One thing of clarification for Bill. Just to come back and to save you a call with Edings, is that organic growth for overall index was 9%. That was, as I said earlier, 11% on the subscription side, and 6% on ABS. Just for clarification on that.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Saeed. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Feel free to call me with any additional questions. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'd turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Tyrone. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release describing our results for the third quarter 2012. A copy of that release may be viewed on our website at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You will also find on our website a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements on our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, and other SEC filings. Today's earnings may -- call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: the lease exit charge, restructuring costs and nonrecurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EPS also excludes the amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and debt repayment and refinancing expenses. Please refer to today's earnings release in Pages 16 to 18 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will be referring to run rate frequently in our discussion this morning, so let me remind you that our run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking fees for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months, assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETFs license to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to Table 10 in our press release for a detailed explanation. Bob Qutub will give you a quick overview of our third quarter results, and then Henry Fernandez will add some additional comments. I will now turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert Qutub: Thanks, Edings, and good morning. Before we begin our review of the third quarter results, I want to give you a quick overview of the impact of Hurricane Sandy on our operations. First and foremost, all of our employees in New York and Rockville offices are accounted for, and all of our offices are fully operational. In fact, we are hosting this call from our New York office here at 7 World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. We owe a big round of thanks for all the emergency workers and those who are working hard to restore services to this area. I also wanted to point out that at no time were our services to our clients interrupted. Our index data was delivered to clients throughout the storm and aftermath, and our risk systems continue to operate, which is a testament to the dedication of our employees and our global platform. Now to the quarter. Earlier this morning, MSCI reported third quarter 2012 revenues of $235 million, up 5% from third quarter 2011, and adjusted EBITDA of $108 million, up 4% year-over-year. MSCI's 2012 adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year at $0.49 per share. Our revenue growth was led by our Performance and Risk segment, which rose $9 million or 5% on higher index and ESG subscription revenue and risk management analytics revenues. Our governance segment revenues also rose by $1 million or 4%. In the quarter, subscription revenue growth of 8% was partially offset by a decline in the more volatile non-recurring revenues. The non-recurring revenues, which tend to be more volatile, as I mentioned earlier, fell by $3 million or as a result of lower fees for unlicensed derivatives and non-recurring governance revenues. On a run-rate basis, our subscription revenues grew 6% to $800 million. Run rate growth was fueled by an 11% increase in index and ESG subscription, 8% growth in governance and 4% growth in risk management analytics. This was partially offset by declines in portfolio management and energy and commodity analytics. The overall operating environment remains difficult, as our clients continue to defer decision-making on new products. This elongation of our sales pipeline weighed on our sales comparisons. However, our retention rate remained at 90%. Now let us take a wholesome look at the performance of each of our major product lines, starting with our subscription index and ESG products, where revenues grew by 11% and the run rate grew also by 11% to $293 million. Index and ESG subscription sales benefited from the strong sales of ESG products, as well as modest growth in sales of benchmark products. Fast subscription growth was offset in part by a decline in non-recurring sales of unlicensed derivatives. As has been the case all year, sales in the Americas have been stronger than those in Europe. Cancelations also increased, but our overall retention remained at 94%. Our asset-based fee revenues fell by 3% as an increase in assets under management was offset by changes in the underlying asset mix. Bottom performance enclosed in the Vanguard ETFs, which are generally our lowest fee products, compressed the average basis point fee. Before I get into the discussion of ABF run rates, let me clarify that we continue to reflect the Vanguard revenues in our reported revenue, along with related AUMs, as a measure of performance. However, prior policy of reflecting known cancels, we have adjusted our run rate, which is a forward-looking measure, to reflect the loss of the Vanguard ETFs. Our asset-based fee run rate fell by 3% year-over-year. But if we exclude the impact of the Vanguard ETFs at both period, our ABF run rate would have increased by 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Again, excluding those ETFs, our blended average fee was 3.7 basis points. Our risk management analytics revenues rose 5% year-over-year, and run rate rose 4% to $262 million. RMA sales remained steady sequentially at $9 million. An increase in sales to asset managers was offset by higher cancels from hedge funds. Despite those cancels, we are starting to see an uptick in activity among hedge funds as they face increasing pressure from asset owners and regulators to provide more disclosure around their positions and risk profile. Overall, risk cancels increased, with most of that coming from Europe. The retention rate is 89%. Also, during the quarter, we migrated a data center in order to upgrade the infrastructure of our underlying -- to underlying our RMA businesses, which caused some disruptions and delayed product upgrade that impacted our sales. Our portfolio management analytics declined 4% and run rate fell 3% to $116 million. The market for quantitative equity models remains very competitive. Overall, we believe we are holding our own in terms of market share, with our moves to match the aggressive pricing of our competitors having an impact on retention rate. We are seeing strong demand for our models and data products from U.S. hedge funds offset by weaker sales to other client types. Our newer products continue to have an impact, as they accounted for almost 50% of the sales on the third quarter. Product introductions during the third quarter included a new China equity model and a European stochastic model. Our governance segment continues to make progress. Revenues rose by 5% and run rate was up 8% to $116 million. Much of the growth in governance run rate has been driven by the success of our new consultation data and analytics product, which was launched in June of last year, and an improvement in retention rates, which have risen to 91% over the first 9 months of the year. Our run rate growth is also benefiting from the migration of non-recurring products, which are not included in run rate, to a sales subscription service, which are included. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA was $108 million, up 4% from last year. Our adjusted EBITDA expense for the quarter was $127 million, an increase of 5% versus the third quarter of 2011, with most of that growth coming from higher compensation expense. The higher compensation expense was driven by an increase in severance, which rose by $3.7 million to $4.1 million, largely as a result of the departure of a senior executive and continued migration of personnel to lower-cost locations. Despite all that, we still grew our average headcount by 9%, with 44% of our employee base located in those lower-cost centers, up from 38% a year ago. Our non-compensation EBITDA expense declined 4% on the back of strong expense management. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.9%, essentially flat with the year ago, and 45.2% for the first 9 months. We continue to plan for our margins to be flat for our current subscription business. However, the impact of Vanguard switch and the dilution from the IPD acquisition, which I'll talk to in a moment, are likely to compress our margin -- our overall margins next year. We had another strong cash quarter. Our cash flow from operations was $98 million in the third quarter 2012 and $288 million year-to-date. Capital spending was $18 million in the third quarter and $38 million year-to-date as we've built out our new office location in New York and invested in our IT infrastructure. We ended the quarter with $434 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we continue to use our available cash in a disciplined manner to accelerate our organic growth and to pursue our strategy of being a provider of a broad range of mission-critical investment decisions support teams, any acquisitions will need to meet both our strategic and financial criteria. Last Wednesday, we took a step towards putting some of that cash to work to support our growth by announcing the acquisition of IPD, a leading provider of performance analytics to real estate funds, investors, managers and occupiers, for approximately $125 million. This acquisition is expected to close during the fourth quarter, but of course, is subject to customary closing conditions. In summary, our revenues continue to grow, led by our recurring subscription revenue. Retention rates are strong, and we continue to maintain a tight grip on our core expense base. Let me now turn it over Henry for some additional comments.
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Bob. Given the focus on the last few weeks on our index business, I would like to first discuss our index franchise. I will then provide you with an update on broader -- on our broader business before closing with some comments about the acquisition of IPD and how it fits our overall strategy. It has been more than 4 weeks since the announcement by Vanguard of its decision to transition to new index providers for certain of its ETFs. This is an appropriate time to update you on our relationships with other ETF providers more broadly, as well as the overall strength of our index franchise. We are seeing significant segmentation occurring among ETF investors based on their needs for liquidity, benchmark sensitivity and long-term returns. There is also a group of investors who place a premium on low expense ratios. I think it is fair to say that we weren't surprised by the manner and the speed in which the ETF providers served in that last group that is focused on lower expense ratios, how fast they have moved to compete, primarily on the basis of expense ratios and the extent to which they were willing to go to reduce their own costs. As the ETF business evolves, MSCI will continue to be a leading provider of indices to those ETF managers who are actively targeting those ETF investors who value liquidity, derivative capabilities and specialized exposure, as well as those ETF managers who value our expertise in defining and measuring markets. MSCI indices are differentiated by the quality of our data, our high level of service, our broad and frequent consultation with clients and the trillions of dollars of assets benchmarked to them. That value has taken us decades to build, and we will continue to work with those ETF managers who understand and put a premium on that value. It is strong affirmation of the value of the MSCI indices when the global head of BlackRock's iShares business, the world's largest manager of ETF assets, describes our indices as the gold standard. It is even stronger affirmation when iShares selected our indices as the basis for an exciting new product line aimed at buy-and-hold investors. The value of MSCI indices has also been validated in recent weeks by the selection of the MSCI China A Index by one of the largest -- the foreign ETF in Hong Kong by one of the largest asset managers in China. And today, nearly every major ETF providers in Europe uses our indices as the basis for their cross-border ETFs. We have also been asked how the Vanguard loss might affect our subscription business. The strength of our index subscription business lies in our relationship with asset owners, pension funds, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, et cetera. Over the past 40 years, MSCI indices have become a critical tool for these investors in helping them think about equity performance, understand the market potential in terms of size and liquidity and evaluating the performance of the managers they select to manage their own money. MSCI is embedded in their investment process and thus, we are embedded into the way they track and measure equity markets and the performance of their asset managers. We have also become embedded in the investment processes of the asset managers themselves. Many of our asset manager clients have explicit contracts with asset owners that call for them to measure their performance against one or more MSCI indices. Our data provides asset managers with rich and valuable insight about the makeup and composition of global equity markets, helping them gain insights about potential opportunities and risks in those equity markets. Our indices also provide these clients with a tool to measure their own performance, not just for their institutional asset owner clients but also internally and externally to a full range of constituencies. The value of our indices provide -- the value of the indices -- the value that our indices provide is further illustrated by the breadth of that business. Our index and ESG subscription run rate was almost $300 million at the end of the third quarter. That run rate was spread out across more than 3,000 clients all over the world. In sum, the decision by any single asset manager, especially one like Vanguard, that is a non-for-profit entity that is primarily focused on U.S. retail investors, is not likely to have a meaningful impact on the balance of our index subscription business worldwide. It does not have any impact on the value we provide to our asset owner clients. It does not have an any impact on the widespread use of MSCI indices as a tool for measuring global equity market performance, and it doesn't change the manner in which the use of our indices is embedded in the investment process of so many clients around the world. While the spotlight has recently been on our index business, I would like to note that our index and ESG subscription run rate is 37% of our $800 million subscription total. MSCI is far more than an index company. Over the last 15 years, we have built or acquired a range of mission-critical investment decision tools that help our clients construct, manage, measure their portfolios across multiple asset classes from equities to fixed income, alternatives, derivatives and now, real estate. You'll see that in our risk management analytics products, where, for example, despite a tough operating environment, hedge funds are increasingly interested in the tools we are developing to help them meet the growing risk disclosure requirement of their investors and regulators. You'll see it in our PMA unit, where our newer products are providing incremental insight about risk and performance and the direction of the market. And you see it in our governance business, where our strategy of broadening the range of governance services we offer, beyond proxy research and voting, is starting to have an impact on revenue growth. Speaking of governance, it is encouraging to note the positive momentum of the proxy research and voting business. This reflects our focused efforts to improve our technology platform and our commitment to client service and high-quality research. We are encouraged to see clients who value our service and the quality of our research coming back to our platform, and we believe we are poised to regain some of the market share that, that business ceded in the recent years. As I noted earlier, MSCI's core strategy is to be a leading provider of mission-critical investment decision tools for all asset classes, with a focus on helping our clients in the construction, management and measurement of their portfolios across all asset classes and all markets in the world. We are very excited to be taking another step in that strategy with the acquisition of IPD, which we announced last week. IPD is a leading provider of investment decision tools to institutional investors in real estate around the world, with an unparalleled database of information on the commercial real estate market, covering 60,000 properties valued at nearly USD 2 trillion. IPD's data, products and clients is strongly complementary to our existing business, with IPD offering real estate investment performance benchmarking, performance analysis, market indices, risk management tools and market research for the owners of, and investors in, commercial real estate worldwide. The real estate investment market presents considerable opportunities for growth for us. We believe that the global property industry is starting to be viewed as one of the major investment asset classes, alongside equities, fixed income, commodities, private equities and hedge funds, all asset classes in which we have products that we serve -- that serve our clients. This all means a more institutional, more active and more global marketplace for property, boosting cross-border market access and understanding. We believe we can further accelerate that evolution through the acquisition of IPD. Furthermore, the addition of IPD will enable us to expand our multi-asset class offering by integrating private real estate assets into our risk and performance models, as well as adding real estate benchmarks to our family of market-leading equity indices. IPD is a great example of how we intend to deploy our capital to support our growth opportunities. As a management team and with the support of our Board, we are focused on identifying and investing in organic growth opportunities. We will also deploy our capital in a disciplined fashion to supplement that organic growth by acquiring businesses, like IPD, that meet our strategic and financial criteria. So before opening up the line to your questions, I would like to summarize our results one more time. Despite a difficult operating environment, our Q3 revenues increased 5%, driven by an 11% increase in index and ESG subscription revenue, a 5% increase in risk management analytics and a 4% increase in our governance revenues. Our index franchise is an industry leader and continues to be recognized as such as evidenced by the launch of new ETFs based on our indices and the global reach of our approach. Growth, smart growth, remains a priority for MSCI. We are focused on identifying and investing in organic growth opportunities, and we will deploy our capital in a disciplined fashion to supplement that by acquiring businesses that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Importantly, MSCI is far more than an equity index company. Our strategy has always been to be a leading provider of mission-critical investment decision tools. The announced acquisition of IPD is another step in the pursuit of that strategy and we think will generate significant returns for our shareholders. Finally, I want to echo some of Bob's comment about Hurricane Sandy. Many of our employees work long hours away from their own families to ensure that we remain fully operational. I want to thank them for that effort. I want to thank all of those workers across New York and New Jersey and Connecticut who continue to work hard to try and rebuild our region and our economy. On this election day, we owe them a big vote of thanks. Now let us open the lines up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from George Mihalos of Crédit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just wanted to touch on the asset-based fees. I think, Bob, you had mentioned that the revenue mix was a bit negative in terms of the price, can skew a little bit more to Vanguard. But the 3.7 bps x-Vanguard, how does that compare to what you've received historically?
Robert Qutub: We include -- sorry, George, just to make sure I've got your question, when you include -- looking back, with Vanguard, what would that have been?
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: No, no. x Vanguard. I think you mentioned that 3.7 is the basis point fee x-Vanguard. Is that kind of steady?
Robert Qutub: Would be about the same, George.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then can you kind of give us a bit of an early read into what you're seeing in terms of sales trends and cancelations in the fourth quarter? Obviously, 4Q is a big quarter in terms of retention, but it also kind of sounded like maybe some sales slipped from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Is that a fair categorization?
Robert Qutub: George, that's a carryover from what we said at the end of Q2. We saw an elongation of the sales pipeline that I talked about in my comments. That's carrying over from the sales perspective. We expect to see that into Q4. With respect to cancelations, you can look back over time and you can see an uptick in the fourth quarter. We're seeing some now, but it's too early to tell what the fourth quarter will bring.
Operator: Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore Partners.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: You walked through some of the reasons for the decline in aggregate retention rates sit in the poor performance of risk businesses in the quarter. Can you give us your perspective on how you expect aggregate retention to trend going forward from here? In other words, are the 3Q retention levels sustainable?
Robert Qutub: I think we've historically shown strong retention rates, you can look back over time. I think that our issue is really about the elongation of the sales platform. As you can see, 90% right now in the quarter, 91% year-to-date is reflecting what I would say a fairly strong overall retention rate across the business.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And then the last, retention rates were down in all 4 businesses year-over-year. Isn't that a concern for you?
Henry A. Fernandez: No. David, I think, the -- if you go back and look at the recent quarters on some of the comments that we have made, we mentioned that we have had extremely robust retention rates even in the context of a challenging environment for our clients. And so there is a tad softening of that happening, but it's not a cause to worry at this point and given what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we're seeing in our pipeline.
Robert Qutub: The other thing I might to add to that, too, David, is remember that the retention rate is a quarter focus, and so anomalies in a quarter can tend to skew it. When I look at the retention rates on a year-to-date basis, you can see in the earnings release, we're effectively flat to where we were year-to-date a year ago.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I see. And then I noticed, Bob, that you didn't disclose core retention rates in the quarter. Is there a reason for that?
Robert Qutub: We felt that the differences, while it was important on a smaller level, we would have seen some changes, but we felt that with sticking to the aggregate retention rate was fine. There were some product costs, sales. If we were to show it, we'll show it in 10-Q. You'll see a slight uptick on the core retention rate when you see it in the Q when it's filed.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Warmington of Raymond James.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: So first question I had was I wanted to ask if you could talk a little bit about what changed, if anything, in the pricing with the legacy BlackRock business.
Henry A. Fernandez: Nothing has changed on the legacy Blackrock ETF. The ETF fee -- the ETF, the legacy ones are exactly the same way they were before the Vanguard announcement.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then the second question was to ask about the capital allocation policy, to ask if you guys would think about doing a buyback or dividends here. And any restrictions on the use of the cash that you have in terms of foreign versus domestic?
Henry A. Fernandez: We are -- our strategy is very much focused on growth and how do we go back to a higher growth environment. Clearly, the world is challenging today on a cyclical basis. But on a secular long-term basis, we believe that there are a lot of forces that are propelling strongly what we do. And therefore, we are very much focused on capitalizing on those organic growth opportunities and how do we capitalize on an increased level of M&A opportunities that we see out there. And therefore, for now, we want to make sure that we have enough cash and we have enough capital and we have enough equity base in our balance sheet to be able to move rapidly to take advantage of those opportunities. We also believe that as the -- eventually, the cycle turns, those opportunities may increase, and therefore, it's pretty critical for us to keep our powder dry.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I guess, could you just give us a quick update, Henry, on the competitive environment for new deals both in RMA and PMA?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think on PMA, the competitive environment remains the same as the last few quarters, and we believe it's here to stay, not that we're going to go back to the pre-competitive environment. I think it's here to stay. And therefore, the premium to operate in that environment is a great deal of innovation, service to clients, being very close to them and price our products in all areas according to the value proposition that we offer. So we are -- we have taken major steps to increase the level of product development. We're very focused on increasing the levels of client service on this business and so on and so forth, right? So that's not that much of a change over the last few quarters. In the RMA business, the level of competition is a lot less than it is in the PMA business. But I think, over time, we anticipate that more competition will come to the RMA business, and therefore, we have began to take steps to operate on a basis as if it were a wide open competitive environment, even if it's not here today.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And does that imply that you have been lowering prices?
Henry A. Fernandez: No, no. What it implies is that we are stepping up our product development efforts. You mention -- you heard Bob mention a major data center migration that we did in order to significantly upgrade our performance and capabilities for the RMA business and being able to launch products faster, later. So that's another step that we've taken. We are increasing our headcount in emerging market centers to be able to service clients and do more managed services for them. We've began to take quite a lot of steps to operate that business more nimble and obviously more competitively, even if the competition is not here.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then, Henry, most of the asset owners that we've spoken with in recent weeks have said that they remain committed to using MSCI indices. But FTSE obviously has their own growth plans in the U.S. and appears to be stepping up its investment on the service side of the business. So just curious, anecdotally what kind of questions or comments you've been getting from asset managers and owners in the weeks since the Vanguard announcement.
Henry A. Fernandez: There's been a flood of the -- of positive comments by asset owners and asset managers worldwide. It's even funny that sometimes we make average calls to clients just to make sure they understood what we were doing and why our approach are differentiated. And some clients have even said, "Don't worry about it. We're a total believer in MSCI. And I don't know why you guys are losing sleep over this." So it's been, to some extent, the opposite. I mean, we've wanted to average -- have an average program to them, so we've gotten quite a lot of comments like that. Secondly, we have seen a meaningful amount of asset switches from the Vanguard funds to the iShares funds. I think more of that will come as we progress in the quarter, will be our guess. And I think we are -- we spend a little bit of time internally here assessing our strategy in the context of all of this. And I think we want to reaffirm that we are not in the business of getting market share at non-revenue or diminished profits. That is not the business we're in. We're not a nonprofit, we're not in the business of market share, we're not -- we're in the business of creating shareholder value for our people and our shareholders, and we're going operate the business that way. And that means, you got to have a higher premium on innovation, on quality, on the network effect between the asset owners and the asset managers and being able to create a better sort of brand on the retail market and the financial advisory market, and you're going to see us do more of that in the next few weeks. So it's a compendium of things. But importantly, we are not in the business of loss leader products and services.
Operator: And your next question is from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Since BlackRock's been promoting your indices as the gold standard, have you had any new potential sales from new customers? Like, has that been helping the sales pipeline there?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think it's too early. This just happened, what, 2, 3 weeks ago, so too early. What I can tell, it's too early to pin any specific sales to the comments by iShares. What I can tell you is that all across the world in terms of our index subscription business and our index licensing business, it's pretty much business as usual. There has been no effect whatsoever on the loss of Vanguard at this point.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And other than FTSE, have you seen any increased competition from other index providers trying to be more aggressive in trying to get some customers to switch to their indices?
Henry A. Fernandez: Not in the recent past.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Ed Demetri of Macquarie.
Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research: My question is with regard to BlackRock and their -- their new products in international ETFs. Hypothetically, if this new segmenting strategy isn't successful for BlackRock and it isn't able to stem its share challenges and they decided that the same kind of strategy it employed in its domestic ETFs where it offered the same high quality, top index branded ETFs but temporarily at lower prices were applied to its international prices, i.e., offering the MSCI emerging market and EFA indexes at lower prices, are you confident that something like that could be -- could happen while you'd be able to continue to get the kind of pricing arrangements that's been customary with them?
Henry A. Fernandez: Okay. I think the -- we are very confident on the iShares strategy of market segmentation. And the reason is because the value proposition of ETFs, the different types of -- different parts of the market is very different. You have institutional asset owners and some asset managers who value enormously the liquidity of the product, the tightness of the bid on our spreads, the tracking of the fund vis-à-vis the benchmark and the like. And when they are in positions of moving large amounts of assets in and out, that liquidity and that tightness and depth of market becomes much more important than the expense ratio of the fund. So we're confident that, that strategy is a good one at this point. And also, I think with respect to what -- how the market evolves, remember -- you've got to remember that the ETF asset class is on a secular growth over time and therefore, you -- on one hand, if there is price erosion you want to put that against the significant increase of the market itself that will benefit us quite substantially over time.
Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research: Let me ask one follow-up. BlackRock is very bullish on the possibilities of the fixed income ETF category. Can you talk at all about what kind of opportunities could be there for MSCI if, in fact, that fixed income ETFs become a really exponential growth story over the next 10 years?
Henry A. Fernandez: We do not, as you know -- well, we do not have fixed income indices at this time. We have them over a decade ago and sold them. We don't have them now, and we're not intending to enter that market at this point. So we don't have a way to benefit directly from that. We are benefiting indirectly though because a number of indices that we have built that have more either value-oriented or fixed-income like characteristics are being embraced by the marketplace. So, for example, our minimum volatility equity indices in which you can invest on the basis of an equity instrument but have a lot lower variability and volatility, which are, therefore, closer to maybe the riskier end of the fixed income market. Those are in significant demand, and we have licensed our indices for investment products and for data quite a lot in the last few months. So there are other ways to play that, the fixed income trend, indirectly. We're also hoping that as we close on the IPD acquisition and play a larger role in REIT ETF and other forms of investment property indices that many of those properties that have high-yielding assets, that we can turn them into indices that have fixed income -- quasi fixed income characteristics.
Operator: This ends the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Tyrone, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to addressing you again in a few months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Mary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2012 earnings call. We are also joined today by Bob Qutub, who will become our Chief Financial Officer after we file our 10-Q. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release describing our results for the second quarter 2012. A copy of that release may be viewed on our website at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You will also find on our website, a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call. This call may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual effects to differ materially -- actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements on our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 and other SEC filings. Today's earnings may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: Restructuring costs and nonrecurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EPS also excludes the amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and debt repayment and refinancing expense. Please refer to today's earnings release in Pages 16 to 18 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will be referring to run rate frequently in our discussion this morning. So let me remind you again that our run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking fees for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months, assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETFs licensed to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to Table 10 in our press release for a detailed explanation. Henry Fernandez will begin the discussion this morning with an overview of the second quarter operating results, and then David Obstler will provide some details on our financial results. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, Edings, and good morning. MSCI reported second quarter 2012 revenues of $239 million, up 5% from the second quarter of 2011 and adjusted EBITDA of $108 million, up 1% year-over-year. MSCI's 2012 adjusted EPS rose 6% year-over-year to $0.50. MSCI had a solid second quarter despite a global operating environment that remained challenging. Our total run rate grew 4% to $920 million. Our subscription businesses grew at a healthy 6% to a run rate of $791 million. That growth was fueled by double-digit expansion in our index and ESG subscription run rate, as well as growth in our risk management analytics and governance units. Our overall subscription sales were steady, as weaker sales to asset managers and U.S. banks were partially offset by sales to hedge funds and asset owners. Our retention rate remains strong. This strength in our retention rate is especially gratifying to us because we have invested heavily over the past few years in our client service function and we continue to invest in improving our technology platforms that connect us with our clients. I would like to also importantly note that our sales pipeline for Q3 and Q4 remain solid. We are continuing to invest in our businesses despite a challenging environment. The pace of that investment has slowed though, versus 2011, but we continue to make targeted additions to our research, product development, client service, and administrative functions. To reduce the impact of those investment costs on our profitability, we are keenly focused on tight expense management. Our continuing and key part of that strategy is our ability to leverage our emerging market centers, which has enabled us to manage our overall compensation levels by migrating certain operating and support functions on parts of our employee base away from more costly developed market centers. During the second quarter, we moved proactively to accelerate that shift, resulting in higher severance expense, which David will touch upon. The percentage of our employees in emerging market centers have gone from about 35% in Q2 '11 to 40% last quarter, to now 42% in this quarter. We're also working pretty hard to manage aggressively, all of our non-compensation expenses. In addition, we are focused on reducing our expenses below the EBITDA line. As we announced on our last call, we successfully refinanced our debt, enabling us to pay down $200 million of debt and lower our interest cost on the remaining $876 million. That should result in annualized interest savings of $16 million. We have also made significant progress in reducing our tax rate by taking advantage of our global footprint. Again, all of these expense management efforts are designed to free up resources in our company to continue to invest in our business without impairing our profitability levels. Let us now take a closer look at the performance of each of our major product lines starting with our index and ESG business. The run rate for our index and ESG subscription business continued to grow at a double-digit pace to $286 million in Q2. While sales weakened during the quarter, the retention rate improved to 95%. Demand for our core index modules, especially the emerging market and the small-cap modules, remained the biggest driver of our run rate growth. We're also seeing continued demand for our strategy indices, notably the minimum volatility and risk weighted indices that we have been introducing over the last couple years. Sales in ESG products rose also as well during the quarter. Our asset-based fees were impacted by the weakness in global equity markets during the second quarter. Assets under management in exchange traded funds linked to MSCI indices, declined to $327 billion at the end of Q2 from $355 billion at the end of Q1 2012. Funds growth were minimal during the quarter. Our bright spot was the performance of ETF linked to our Minimum Volatility Indices. These ETFs, which were launched by a major provider last October, have reached more than $1 billion of assets under management already. We also experienced a slowdown in equities we have launched activity during the second quarter with a total of 6 new launches of ETFs linked to our indices. Our overall ETF pricing remained unchanged and stable during the quarter at an average of 3 basis points. We continue to see positive acceptance of MSCI linked futures and options contracts. The revenue impact of this business remains small but volumes of these products are growing and we are seeing additional interest from exchanges around the world in licensing our indices. Eventually, the success of these futures and options also lead to more business for us in the structure derivative products. Our risk management analytics run rate rose 4% year-over-year to $259 million. It's important to remember that approximately 20% of the run rate of the risk management business is dealt in euros and the weakening of the euro depressed the underlying sequential run rate growth by more than $2 million in the second quarter and by more than $7 million compared to second quarter 2011. Over the first half of the year, RMA sales have benefited from increased demand from asset owners and also from hedge funds, driven in part by new reporting requirements in the latter client group. We continue to see strong demand for our hedge fund transparency products as well -- this is before Measurisk product line. Offsetting that strength, was the declining sales to asset managers and U.S. banks and broker-dealers. The business in RMA also continued to benefit from the strong retention rates. Portfolio Management Analytics run rate was $117 million, essentially flat versus the prior period, the prior year. Solid sales in the quarter, especially of our new models for hedge funds were offset by an uptick in cancels. We continue to see the results of our investment in new products, which accounted for an increasing percentage of our total sales in EMA. During the quarter, we enhanced our lineup of innovative new models by introducing new market models for Canada, Australia and China. We are encouraged to see that the enhancements released earlier in the year for Barra Portfolio Manager also appear to be gaining some traction in the marketplace. Our governance business continues to make progress and improve. Governance run rate was $114 million, up 6% versus 2011. Much of the growth in Governance run rate has been driven by the success of our new executive compensation data and analytics product, which was launched in June of last year. Since its launch, we have sold $9 million in new executive compensation subscriptions. The retention rates are positive and we continue to see a strong demand for this product. I'm especially pleased with the retention rate for the Governance business, which were 92% in the quarter and 90% in the first half of the year. Retention rates in Governance are at their highest rate since before the beginning of the financial crisis. These higher retention rates are due in part to investments we have made in client service and in our technology platform to see a change that connects us with our client. Given the ongoing financial pressures being faced by our clients and the presence of competitors in this business, our retention rate, our higher retention rate is an important vote of confidence from our clients in the value that we're delivering in this business. Let me now turn it over to David Obstler for a discussion of our financial results. David?
David M. Obstler: Thanks, Henry. I would like to start my discussion with a review of the key drivers of our revenue growth in the second quarter, which are outlined on Page 11 of the slides, which we have posted to our website. Total revenues grew by $12 million year-over-year or 5% to $239 million. Our revenue growth was led by index and ESG subscription revenues, which were up $7 million or 14% and risk management analytics revenues, up $4 million or 6%. Our subscription revenues year-over-year grew by $16 million or 9%, offset by a $2 million or 6% decline in asset-based fees. As I'm sure all of you recall, global markets and the average AUM in our ETFs linked to the MSCI indices peaked in the second quarter of 2011, resulting in a tough year-over-year comparison. Nonrecurring revenues fell by $2 million to $6 million year-over-year. Much of this decline in nonrecurring revenues can be attributed to our decision to shift the focus of our sales efforts to subscription corporate compensation analytics products. My next topic is our expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA expense for the quarter was $131 million, an increase of 9% versus the second quarter of last year with virtually all of the growth coming from a compensation expense increase. Our compensation expenses, excluding nonrecurring stock-based comp, rose $11 million or 13% year-over-year. As Henry discussed earlier, our compensation costs were impacted in the quarter by $4 million of severance and other expenses related to recent headcount reductions. Backing out that expense, our compensation expense rose in the mid to high single-digit range, which is significantly below the 16% growth in our average headcount and more indicative of the kind of leverage we expect from the shift in our employee base to emerging market centers. As we have noted earlier, we have significantly slowed the pace of new hires versus 2011 so we expect to see decelerating year-over-year growth in headcount in the second half of this year. Our second quarter non-compensation expenses were essentially flat year-over-year. Occupancy expenses rose by $2.5 million versus the second quarter of last year, driven in part by duplicative rent expenses as we consolidate our operations in New York City and move our offices in Rockville, Maryland, as well as due to an increase investment in information technology. To offset these costs, we have worked very hard to reduce our other non-compensation expenses and we benefited from lower professional fees, market data expenses and travel and entertainment costs. With the office move now nearly complete, we expect our occupancy costs will decline in the second half of 2012 as the duplicative leases roll off. We will also likely record a $3 million to $5 million charge to exit one of our New York office locations in the third quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $108 million, up slightly from last year. On a segment basis, performance and risk EBITDA was $103 million, up 3%. Our Governance segment EBITDA was $5 million, down $2 million or 29% from the second quarter of last year. Below the EBITDA line, as Henry mentioned, we are making progress in reducing our expenses. Our interest expense in the quarter was $29.6 million but that number includes a $20.6 million charge related to our second quarter debt repayment and refinancing, which is nonrecurring. As Henry mentioned, on May 4, we raised $880 million of term loan A indebtedness and used the proceeds plus $200 million of cash on hand to repay our previously-outstanding term loan B debt. The repayment of $200 million of debt lowered our annualized interest costs by roughly $7 million and the lower interest rate on the remaining portion lowered our ongoing interest costs on an annualized basis by an additional $9 million. The tax rate was 34.4% in the quarter and 35.1% for the first 6 months. While the nominal tax rate was flat compared to a year ago, we think that this understates the progress we've made. Last year's tax expense was impacted by discrete benefits and also included the benefit from the R&D tax credit. This year, we have fewer discrete benefits and are not receiving the benefit of the R&D tax credit. We are now projecting that our full year tax rate will be between 35% and 35.5%. So backing out the impact of discrete and tax credits, we are expecting our operating tax rate to decline by almost 100 basis points from the level of 2011 to an increase in income recognized in lower tax jurisdictions around the world. Finally, we had another very strong cash quarter. Our cash flow from operations was $120 million, up from $106 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, we have generated $190 million of operating cash flow. Our strong cash flow has helped us to offset the impact of modestly-higher capital spending and paid down significant debt while retaining a very comfortable cash position. Capital spending was $16 million in the second quarter and $20 million year-to-date as we have built out our new locations in New York and invested in our IT infrastructure. We ended the quarter with $360 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. With that, let me now turn the call back over to Henry.
Henry A. Fernandez: Thank you, David. Before we open up the call to your questions, I want to welcome Bob Qutub, our incoming Chief Financial Officer. Bob joined MSCI at the beginning of July and will officially take over the CFO role very shortly. Over the course of his long career in Bank of America, Bob was instrumental in developing and implementing a comprehensive set of financial and operating metrics for each of the business units for which he was CFO of. This experience will be invaluable as we build the financial infrastructure to support our growth. Welcome, Bob.
Robert Qutub: Thanks, Henry. I'm delighted to be here.
Henry A. Fernandez: I also want to acknowledge and recognize the work that David Obstler has done over the past 2 years. This is David's last earnings call and he will be leaving MSCI at the end of the month. As CFO of RiskMetrics from 2005 to 2010, David was one of the architects of that company's growth, its successful IPO and eventual sale. Since joining MSCI at the time of the merger, David has made an important contribution to the successful integration of MSCI and RiskMetrics and has had a critical role in other financing and corporate activities, including the recent successful refinancing of our outstanding debt. He has also been a strong and effective voice of MSCI to many of you and others in this trade. David, thank you for your work in helping to build MSCI and we all wish you well in the next chapter of your professional life.
David M. Obstler: Thank you, Henry. As you've mentioned, I've been CFO of first, RiskMetrics and then MSCI for the past 7-plus years. It has been a real pleasure to have been part of such an amazing growth story. Over the years, I have seen our companies and our markets change significantly but one thing that hasn't changed is the sheer size of the opportunity in front of this company. I firmly believe that MSCI has significant room to expand and I am looking forward to watching the company grow for many years to come. And with that, let's open the call to your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Mihalos from Crédit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Firstly, David, thanks for your help over the years and best of luck and Bob, welcome aboard. So Henry, I just wanted to start off, you mentioned the ETF pipeline slowing in 2Q certainly after a very strong first quarter. What's the outlook like for ETF launches going forward?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think it's definitely less than it has been in the last 12 months. I think that a lot of the ETF sponsors are assessing and reassessing a lot of their plans even though this product category has done fairly well relative to many of the other ones, and especially relative to our equity mutual funds in America. There is obviously a significant investment required and some risk in continuing the high pace of launches that took place in the last 12 months. So I think we'll see potentially, a little bit of a slowdown but I think everyone believes that the category continues to be very strong and in our case, we're very focused on not only continuing to work with the existing client base here in the U.S. and in Europe, but we, in the last few months, have started focusing quite a lot of energy of our ETF business in Asia, especially in China.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then maybe, can you talk a little bit about the sales cycle and the outlook for the RiskManager business now as we enter the back half of the year? I think typically, that business has strengthened a bit as we tend to go to the second half.
David M. Obstler: Yes, the RMA, you're speaking George, to the RMA business, right?
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes.
Henry A. Fernandez: The RMA business, the pipeline continues to be solid and pretty much in many parts of the world. The issue has always been, with these kinds of sales, is that the pipeline is solid, not a lot gets dropped at all from it and the issue is the pace at which we can close out those items in the pipeline and book the sales. In the last 3 or 4 quarters, as we have reported in these calls, given the environment, a lot of our clients are cautious, more approvals are needed, the sales cycle has gotten a little longer and therefore, I would -- therefore, the particular sales that are happening in any single quarter are probably going to be a little more chunky, little more in one quarter, maybe a little less in the following quarter and so on and so forth because of just the nature of the environment. But we continue to feel very good about the pipeline and especially in Europe, actually. And therefore, more to come on this.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And just last question for me. Can you talk a little bit about the decline in the retention rate for the portfolio management business, maybe some of the challenges that you're seeing there, if it's competitive or more sort of structural?
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, I think this is -- I would view this 84% retention rate in the second quarter, 88% for the first half of the year as business as usual. I mean, some quarters, it will go up to the low 90s, some quarters it will stay in the 80s. The business remains competitive and I think it will stay competitive. We have adapted to that level of competition by doing a lot of different things, obviously including a lot of new product introduction and increasing dramatically our client service efforts and retention efforts and the like. So I would not read too much into it. I think it is going to be bearable, depending on what the sales activity in that particular quarter and this second quarter, there was a little bit of an uptick in cancels but we remain very comfortable of where we are with this business given of course, the challenges in the global environment and also in the quan [ph] managers, which haven't seen that much of a huge influence into their funds. So we feel pretty good and especially because we continue to launch a lot of new products and as an increasing percentage of new sales of the PMA business are in those new products.
David M. Obstler: Yes, if you look at the Core Retention Rate, which excludes product switches amongst star [ph], the retention rate for the first half of the year was just under 90%, which is a pretty good retention rate, a little under last year, and it reflects what we've been talking about, which is strong concentration on our core clients, and new products and innovation to retain those clients.
Henry A. Fernandez: That's actually a good point because -- that David just made, because we are -- we obviously are agnostic with respect to clients on whether they use our Barra Portfolio Manager or Aegis or BarraOne or they actually get the Models Direct, which is the direct data with our software, and all we want is to make sure we satisfy the needs of the client and they're shopping at MSCI. So I think you will continue to see a little bit of volatility as well in this switch of products from one kind of business to the other and that increasingly -- it'd probably be better to focus on that retention rate rather than the other one.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jennifer Huang from UBS.
Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: You had mentioned that the pace of the investments, while you guys are very focused on it, has slowed slightly from last year. Can you just talk about which areas you're investing in now versus last year?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think last year, especially in the second half, our investment was very much across-the-board from sales to client service, consultants, the business -- the product management and business units, the research and development organizations, for sure, a lot of the support functions in HR and finance and stocks [ph] and the like, and we have benefited from that expansion especially in the client retention because we hire a significant number of people in client service in emerging markets to have a higher approach of service to our clients and be proactive at the times of renewals. So we benefited significantly with that. This year, we're trying to be much more targeted in what we do. I think we have a relatively good footprint of salespeople in all the various locations, we probably could add some more in emerging markets for the emerging market clients, we are looking at that. But we have a fairly good footprint. I think we have hired a number of people in client service and in the process of training them in the last 12 months and getting them fully productive. So I think we're fine with that. A lot of our efforts right now have been more on the product development organization, we're rounding up certain key hires in our research organization. We recently hired a managing director in our multi-asset class risk modeling team, has joined us a few weeks ago. We're in the process of hiring somebody else as well in our equity modeling, fino [ph] process. So we're making those investments there. And lastly, we want to continue to strengthen the administrative function. We recently hired our global head of HR, which started yesterday and we're going to make some selective hires in the financial organization to build out that team, especially financial analysis and planning and especially an infrastructure to look at investment very thoroughly on a return on investment basis and tracking them and the like. So those are some of the targeted investments we're making as opposed to, pretty much, as opposed to across the board.
Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of the headcount, can you discuss in which areas that you had seen a reduction? I know it's in a developed market but, which business units or which functions, employee functions?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes, what we did in the second quarter was, we took a very hard look once again at all the functions that we perform in developed market centers in New York, London, Geneva, in Berkeley and Tokyo and places like that and we said, what kind of functions of those that we do there can be moved to emerging market centers where we already have built an infrastructure, where we already have talent and we can add more talent to that place? And we have benefited from having already built a lot of it, enabling technology to glue all those teams globally. So a lot of what we did in the second quarter was not in the sales organization or client service or in consulting. It was not in the distribution part of the organization. A lot of it was not also in the product management organization, those functions continue to be needed in financial centers as close to the clients as possible. A lot of the effort of continuing to migrate positions have been in software engineering, in IT infrastructure, in data, some functions in finance that we can do better and with great talent in emerging market centers, so those are some examples of that, Jennifer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Suzi Stein from Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you talk about the new sales number? I guess it looks like recurring subscription sales were down 6% year-over-year and cancellations were up, which I guess, drove down the net new recurring sales 27%. Is there noise in that or is that just simply a function of the environment? And I guess, if the environment doesn't improve over the next couple of quarters, are you expecting this level of net in sales for the rest of the year?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think, Suzi, there are 2 or 3 things that are going on here, to explain these numbers. First, my sense of the quarterly total sales and recurring sales numbers is that they're going to vary a bit up-and-down based on the comment that I made before, which is we have a solid pipeline and in some quarters, we'll close out a higher percentage of the pipeline and in other quarters will be a lower percentage of the pipeline. So from that point of view, there will be more noise than it used to be in a more reasonable environment, operating environment. That's one overall comment. The second one is that we have seen some weakness in asset managers across-the-board in Asia, in Europe and the U.S. and especially in the U.S. and asset managers are clearly a larger percentage, 55% or so of our sales are to asset managers and it's not because they don't want to make the purchases, it's not because they don't need the product, they are just being cautious in what they're doing and if anything, those are the ones that are delaying or taking more time to make decisions about items in the pipeline. So that has had that effect in the second quarter. So I think that clearly, if the environment continues to deteriorate, I don't think we will see too many items being withdrawn from the pipeline because that has been our experience in the last 5, 6 quarters. What we may see is again, elongated sales cycles that will take longer to close out the pipeline. So we've entered Q3 with a very solid pipeline, actually even more solid than it was in Q2. But in Q2, the turning of the pipeline into sales was lower and it's hard to say what will happen in Q3. It could be that we end up doing better than we did in Q2 or we could have been equal or worse than in Q2. But what we feel cautiously optimistic is that the pipeline remains healthy and solid and now it's just a question of grinding through it and trust me, it's a lot of grinding through it, given the difficult environment our clients are facing. And as you know well, there is a lot of uncertainty all over the place there in the U.S. There is every single excuse that people can give you from the elections, the fiscal cliff, the Dodd-Frank and all of that. In Europe, it's obviously the sovereign debt crisis but in Europe, relative to targets, we have done, relative to targets that we set for ourselves last year, we've done actually relatively well and a lot of it is because our products do well in these kinds of environment and secondly, a lot of our business in Europe is concentrated in the U.K. and in Northern Europe, much less in Southern Europe and we benefited from that. Asia is weak. Actually, a lot of people talk about the difficulties of hiring and selling into Europe, if anything, in Asia, it's actually weaker for us. But fortunately, it's a smaller percentage of our overall business.
David M. Obstler: And Suzi, to amplify a little bit what Henry's saying and give you an example. The pipeline as we've been saying, hasn't really changed that much in the last few quarters. But we have some chunky business. So what determines that last few million dollars of sales is do we sign a contract at the end of the quarter or the beginning of the next quarter or later. And for instance, there were a couple contracts in the quarter that didn't get signed and got signed at the beginning of the next quarter. We can't predict that but given the lumpiness of this in some of the product lines, that determines the last few million dollars of sales and therefore, your comparison.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Raymond James.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask about the Subscriptions business within index and your thoughts about whether that can continue to grow in the mid teens in the second half of 2012? And if you can give us some color on how you think -- what will be the drivers for that? And then on the expense side, I wanted to ask for some thoughts on year-over-year expense growth there given the roll off of the duplicate occupancy costs and also the lower investment levels, and what that would mean for margins in the second half?
Henry A. Fernandez: I'd like to stay away from guidance on a specific segment especially, obviously, in index subscription. What I can tell you, Bill, is that there clearly has been a slowdown, a gradual slowdown in index subscription sales compared to this time last year and I don't see that accelerating meaning -- I don't see that slowdown turning around fast to a recovery given where we are between now and the second half -- the end of the year because China's still in a little bit of a funk and clearly creating issues in Asia. Obviously, I don't see a resolution on the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and a change of environment there. And if anything, in the U.S., we probably will face a little more of an uncertain environment in the September through December period given the election and the fiscal cliff. But I continue to -- we continue to see solid and healthy pipeline in index subscription and now it's just a question of how much we can turn into actual signed contracts and how much of it doesn't happen, but I don't see any significant problems at all in this business. It's just a reflection of the environment, a reflection of cautiousness on the part of asset managers and obviously, there's been weakness with respect to the sales of this product to banks and the like.
David M. Obstler: And Bill, with regard to your expense question, let me talk -- review some of the expense discussion that is onetime or special in the quarter and without getting to margin guidance. I think we mentioned that there was a $4 million severance in the court [ph] relating...then in terms of duplicate rents, that number is in the low millions per quarter. In terms of the duplicate facilities, we do have an increase of rent that we mentioned, $2.5 million year-over-year and about half of that, roughly, is in the increase in the rent and half of that is in the duplicate rent. We also mentioned that in the fourth quarter, related to our consolidated third quarter, sorry, it relates to our consolidation of facilities in New York, that we would have a write off and we mentioned $3 million to $5 million, which would be related to the exit from one of our facilities. So those are some of the things that I wanted to call out on the expense structure.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Got you. Now does the $3 million to $5 million flow in above the line?
David M. Obstler: We haven't reported yet. It would be something that wouldn't be recurring but it would be part of our operating expenses.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Got you. And I missed that, was it third quarter or fourth?
David M. Obstler: We expect it to be third quarter and we expect, as we have been, in both our Qs and our earnings to report on that as we reach that number.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, excellent. And just -- I wanted to also ask about how the client budgets are doing specifically, for middle office products? That seems like an area that, even with the turmoil, has been able to maintain some good funding and the implications of that for RiskManager?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think the environment that we're facing is an environment in which we are not seeing deep or significant cost cutting by clients in too many of their functions. And therefore, it's not affecting -- people are not calling and say, I've been told that we got to cut 20% and you got to tell me what part of your business with us we're going to cut. There are isolated events like that for sure, but it's not across-the-board, which is good because in an environment like this, you probably would've expected more of that. Secondly, the budgets are still there, that were designed at the end of last year by clients. But people are more cautious in spending it, there are more accruals needed and there are more hurdles that people have to go through and that obviously affects the sales cycle. I think with respect to risk management, many organizations have created budgets or made room to make purchases in this area. Hedge funds, because of the new regulatory requirement, especially Form PF that they have to file with the SEC in the new registration process. As an example, asset owners are on a secular trend to put our risk management systems in a lot of what they do and asset managers are also looking to, especially wealth managers, to put service management systems in that. So if anything, the middle office expenditures compared to a year or 2 years ago, have increased rather than decreased.
David M. Obstler: And if you look also at the retention rate in terms of what clients are doing with their existing products, the retention rates of, in the risk area, of around 92% and across the company, indicate that clients are sticking with their products and this is relatively the same level that they've ordered in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore Partners.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Henry, just picking up on George's question earlier and your comments about cautious buying patterns from customers, could you kind of flesh out what you're seeing a bit in the competitive environment, particularly in risk management analytics and portfolio management analytics where you don't have the near monopoly position that you have in index and ESG? And then maybe frame that in the context of price. Do you feel that you can hold price in this environment when your customers clearly have indicated such a cautious tone to you?
Henry A. Fernandez: So I think in the Portfolio Management Analytics, no real change from the last 2 years. I think there was a little bit of a step-down function, right, in terms of pricing and competitive nature of that business at that time and it has remained the same. We won a number of mandates, RFPs from a -- in a competitive bake off and we lost 1 or 2 here and there. So I think that has -- that remains the same and our pricing has pretty much remained the same on that business. On the RMA, on the Risk Management Analytics business, there's been a bit more competition in that business, slightly more, I would not want to scare anybody, slightly more. It has not been -- it has been more around functionality, bundling services, ability to have certain types of models and certain types of software, much more than an issue of price. I think there will be selective cases in which price becomes the issue. But right now, it's more of an issue of, are you covering the whole waterfront and what the client needs, do you have the expertise in all the various asset classes and the like.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: On a related question, Henry, can you give us an update on BlackRock? Where they stand with respect to their regulatory filing before the SEC to launch their own proprietary indices? And I know you put out the amended 10-K with respect to BlackRock, so any significant updates there we should be aware of?
Henry A. Fernandez: Nothing. There's absolutely no change whatsoever on that front with BlackRock. As we said before, they're a very valuable client of ours and we hope that, that remains for many years to come. On the ETF front, we continue to build -- to have and strengthen and build a very strong relationship. There are very frequent meetings among our teams all over the world. They have launched 25 ETFs linked to our indices so far this year and then they just launched 4 in Canada in the last week or 2. They have more to come so the "business as usual relationship" is strong, it's very collaborative and the like. So no change to what we said at the time.
David M. Obstler: Yes, the 10-K is not related to any change in the agreement or any change. As Henry mentioned, it's related to the request of the SEC for information in a certain form.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: A final question for me. Henry, just given the $200 million debt paydown, just your updated thoughts on capital allocation priorities going forward.
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. I think at this point, we are -- we're beginning to see more and more acquisition opportunities. That doesn't mean we're going to do anything but I think what was happening in the last couple of years was there wasn't a single bid; those companies who wanted to sell, were waiting for a full recovery and with the double-dip, they probably got scared and said "might as well take the money now rather than keep waiting". So we've seen more dialogue, we've seen more flow and the like at reasonable prices. Nothing big, just smaller kind of deals. And therefore, it behooves us to keep our powder very dry in that environment to, in the event that something comes along that we like that is strategic, that is in our backyard and all the things that -- our criteria has not changed, whatsoever, in terms of acquisitions. So I think that, that is what is informing, basically, our view on cash versus using the cash to pay down debt or for our own purposes. But look, 1 year goes by, 2 years goes by and nothing really happens there, we'll have to reassess and decide what we want to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Ditmire for Macquarie.
Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research: I have a question related to Knight Capital Group who said today that it's exploring its strategic options. And I wanted to go through -- in the past, we've had issues with some sizable customers have consolidated or joined other customers and then we could get an impact in terms of not just the revenue impact but on renewal rates at some -- several quarters down the line when contracts come up. Is there any way you can help us kind of size the -- whether or not this is a material customer and whether that's a possibility with a customer like this, that down the line, we could get a material impact to the renewal rates, et cetera, from something like this?
Henry A. Fernandez: I'm thinking ultimately, as I've disclosed in our financial statements, the only customer that sticks out, given the strong relationship we have, is BlackRock, right? And that's mostly on the nature of the ETF business, which is our -- some of these are MSCI brand and ETF that clients love to have, right? Or investors, I should say, love to have. So there is no real meaningful exposure to any other single client anywhere in the world. And therefore, the merger of 2 large client of ours, first of all, it typically takes time for that to work through the system in terms of rationalizing expenses. Secondly, sometimes, they end up needing more tools from us and therefore, they convert the spend that they have on loss on other products. So sometimes, the run rate doesn't go down. And then thirdly, as I said, there is no meaningful exposure to any other single client, as I said, with the exception of BlackRock given the ETF revenues.
Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research: Just a follow up. You don't think it's possible that even a small customer could have an outsized impact on the renewal rate in a given quarter?
Henry A. Fernandez: No way, no.
David M. Obstler: In a product line, as we talked about over the years, in a product line in a quarter, because the computation is magnified, but over the year, no.
Henry A. Fernandez: I think, David, just to add, I mean, do not underestimate how widely diversified our business is from names of institutions. If anything, sometimes we'll report our run rate, or sometimes we talk about our run rate with any particular institution, but often -- more often than not, that is broken down into 3 areas. So if it's a big financial institution, it's the broker-dealer it's the wealth management, it's the investment management part. So they're very different organizations. Secondly, we are very diversified across regions of the world, across client types -- from pension funds and other forms of asset owners and asset managers and hedge funds, the wealth managers and the like, from top down managers to passive managers and we're very diversified across product lines from indices and PMA, RMA, executive compensation analytics and governance products and services and the like. So no one single lever of any of these creates a meaningful or significant shock to the system.
David M. Obstler: And I think as Henry mentioned, we sell a department level off [ph] and so it's a combination of those operations as departments. We obviously have a lot of history now since the financial crisis and have seen this happen and I think as Henry mentioned, it goes a number of ways. It goes toward the consolidation where they buy more. But generally, the organization that resolves, isn't turning off the services altogether and it's a renegotiation and consolidation over a longer period of time.
Operator: Thank you. I show no further questions at this time and would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Edings Thibault for closing remarks.
Edings Thibault: Thank you. I think that concludes our call today. I want to thank you, Mary, for your help and thank, obviously, all of you, for your interest in MSCI. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MSCI First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And now, I'll turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Tyrone. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release describing our results for the first quarter of 2012. A copy of that release may be viewed on our website at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. You will also find on our website a slide presentation that we have prepared for this call. It's the first time that we have prepared slides for earnings call, so I hope you appreciate the additional clarity we think this will provide. We certainly welcome your feedback. This presentation may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect MSCI's future results, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2011. Today's earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: construction costs and nonrecurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EPS also excludes the amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and debt repayment and refinancing expenses. Please refer to today's earnings release and Pages 16 to 18 of the investor presentation for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures.  We will be referring to run rate frequently in our discussion this morning. So let me remind you that our run rate is an approximation at a given point in time the forward-looking fees for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months, assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETFs licensed to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to Table 7 in our press release for a detailed explanation. Henry Fernandez will begin the discussion this morning with an overview of the first quarter operating results, and then David Obstler will provide some details on our financial results.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning, MSCI reported first quarter 2012 revenues of $221 million, up 3% from first quarter 2011, and adjusted EBITDA of $102 million, down 2% year-over-year. MSCI's 2012 adjusted EPS rose 2% year-over-year to $0.44. Excluding our $5 million in revenue correction, which today we will discuss in more detail, revenues grew 5% to $234 million, adjusted EBITDA grew 3% to $107 million and adjusted EPS increased 9% to $0.47. Turning now to our operating results. MSCI had a solid start to the year. Our run rate rose 6% to $919 million, driven by 7% growth in our subscription run rate and 2% growth in the run rate for our asset-based fees. The operating environment worldwide in the first quarter remained broadly unchanged compared to recent quarters. Our recurring subscription sales remained steady as the index and ESG business and risk management analytics continue to perform well and the Governance business provided a lift in the quarter. Retention rates increased in both the portfolio management analytics and Governance businesses and remain exceptionally high. We remain focused on meeting the demand from our customers for innovative new solutions to their investment problems.  During the quarter, we rolled out new strategy indices, enhanced the software and risk measurement capabilities of our RiskManager platform, introduced an upgraded version of Barra Portfolio Manager and released an innovative new Global Equity Model. We expect to maintain a high pace of innovation over the course of 2012.  During the first quarter, we opened a new sales office in Seoul, Korea, underlining our commitment to Asia. In addition to my trip to Korea for the official opening of our office during the quarter, I was also able to visit our offices and our key clients in South Africa and in Brazil. At MSCI, we often refer to the globalization of investing as one of the key themes that drives our growth. For the most part, that has meant the increased allocation of capital by developed market investors to nondomestic markets and increasingly emerging and frontier markets. But as institutional investors in emerging markets themselves also continue to grow assets and broaden their investment horizons, I am convinced that this market can become an important source of demand for MSCI products and services, and our global footprint in all these emerging markets around the world position us very well for that upturn. Let us now look a little more closely at the performance of each of our businesses starting with Equity Index and ESG. Total index and ESG run rate grew by 9%, fueled by continued growth in our subscription run rate.  Run rate for the index and ESG subscription business, which, as you know, excludes asset-based fees, rose 12% year-over-year to $279 million. Among our index subscription products, the biggest sellers continue to be our core emerging market and developed market index modules. We also saw a strong growth in sales on the small cap index modules, which is a sign that our efforts to promote the MSCI ACWI IMI index as a policy benchmark for asset owners, is starting to have a positive impact on the demand for a small cap mandate. We are continuing our efforts to promote our Risk Premia Indices and have been encouraged by the interest that we are seeing from asset owner clients worldwide. MSCI has one sizable investment mandate for Risk Premia Indices in every major region of the world.  Another area of strength for us was in sales of our environmental, social and governance products. I noted on our call last time that we have focused on consolidating our product lineup and building our sales force for the ESG business. With most of that work now complete, I am pleased to see a return to sales growth for this product category. Our asset-based fee run rate rose by 2% year-over-year and by 14% sequentially to $137 million in the first quarter of 2012. The biggest driver of growth was an increase in AUM in the change credit funds linked to MSCI indices. AUM increased to $355 billion at the end of the first quarter 2012 in the wake of the rally in global equity markets, up from $302 billion at the end of 2011. After a 2-quarter hiatus, fund flows were once again an important driver of AUM growth for MSCI-linked EPS, contributing $15 billion to the AUM increase in the quarter. The number of ETFs linked to MSCI indices also continue to grow, rising to 560 at the end of the first quarter, up from 524 at the end of 2011.  Our overall pricing remained stable with our average basis point fee, excluding minimum fees, of 3.0 basis points. Our risk management analytics run rate rose 6% year-over-year to $258 million. During the quarter, the RMA business continued to benefit from a strong demand from asset owners and wealth managers. In fact, we signed an agreement in the quarter with one of the top U.S. wealth managers to use our WealthBench and RiskManager products to measure and manage risk for their portfolios of their high net worth clients. MSCI is now providing risk management systems to 4 of the top 5 largest U.S. wealth managers. We also signed agreements to provide our BarraOne risk management platform to 2 of the top 8 pension funds in the United States. Demand for our hedge platform, which, as you remember, is a result of the merger of our hedge platform with the Measurisk acquisition, this demand from large funds also remains strong in the quarter. Overall, sales of RMA products to asset managers, both in Europe and the Americas, were weak during the quarter. As we expected, retention rates in the RMA business rebounded after dipping in the fourth quarter of 2011 and were flat compared to a year ago.  Portfolio management analytics run rate was $118 million, essentially flat versus the prior year. Our recurring subscription sales modestly outpaced our cancels, but that growth was offset by a currency hit resulting from the weakening of the Japanese Yen. While the selling environment for PMA products remain challenging, we continue to see the results of our investment in new products. In the first quarter 2012, we released an upgrade to our Barra portfolio management platform, as I indicated before, and extended our new quantitative modeling enhancement to our Global Equity Model. New products in PMA accounted for an increase in percentage of our total sales and were one of the key drivers behind an increase in retention rates. We will continue to launch more new products in PMA over the course of 2012. Our Governance business had a very good first quarter. Governance run rate rose 7% year-over-year to $113 million. There were 2 key drivers of the run rate growth in the Governance segment. First, we are transitioning our corporate business from its historical focus on one-time sales to an emphasis on sales of subscription products. The second driver and the more important one to our growth was the strong demand for our executive compensation data and analytical tools, a new product that we introduced in the middle of 2011, as you may remember. The institutional proxy market remained challenging as our asset manager clients continue to keep a tight reign on spending. Retention rates in the Governance business also improved, rising to 89% from 85%.  Let me now turn it over to David for some additional comments on our first quarter results.
David M. Obstler: Thank you, Henry. I would like to start my discussion with a review of the key drivers of our revenue growth in the first quarter, which are outlined on Page 11 of the slides that are posted to our website. Total revenue grew by $6 million year-over-year or 3% to $229 million. Our revenue growth was led by index and ESG subscription revenue, which was up 15%, and risk management analytics revenue, which was up 9%. Our subscription revenues grew by $10 million or 6%.  Our subscription revenue growth was impacted by a noncash negative revenue adjustment of $5.2 million to correct an error in our prior period FEA energy and commodity analytics revenues, which I will talk about later. Excluding the impact of that correction, our subscription revenues would have risen 9% in the quarter and our total revenues would have been up by 5% versus the first quarter of last year. Our revenue growth rate was also impacted by a lower growth rate in both asset-based fee and nonrecurring revenues. Our asset-based fees grew by $1 million or 3%, driven in part by a modest increase in the average AUM due to the decline in equity markets in the second half of 2011. As we have already discussed, we have experienced a rebound in those markets in the first quarter, resulting in an 11% sequential increase in asset-based fee revenues.  Nonrecurring revenues fell by $5 million to $8 million year-over-year. If you recall, we recorded a $4.2 million one-time nonrecurring revenues in the first quarter of last year, resulting from the renegotiation of a contract with one of our ETF provider clients. Absent that single sale, our nonrecurring revenues declined by $1 million, mainly due to the changing of our business model in the advisory and compensation product line in our Governance segment.  Now I would like to say a word about the first quarter revenue reduction we recorded to correct our accounting for our FEA business. In prior quarters, MSCI recognized a substantial portion of the revenue under its FEA software licenses upfront rather than amortizing that revenue over the life of the contracts, which is now the correct method of recognition. The change springs the recognition of our energy and commodity analytics revenues in line with most of our other subscription products. The impact of the change did not have a material effect on our previously reported financial statements in recent years. In addition, there is no effect on the run rate in that business.  My next topic is our expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA expenses for the quarter were $127 million, an increase of 7% versus the first quarter of last year. The increase was balanced between composition expense, excluding nonrecurring stock-based compensation, which rose 7.2% to $92 million, and non-compensation expenses, which rose 6.6% to $35 million. The biggest driver of our increasing compensation was headcount. Our total number of employees at the end of the first quarter was 2,465, an increase of 20% from a year ago. Much of that growth has been focused on our emerging market centers, and we have increased the percentage of our employees in those locations to 40% versus 32% a year ago. Leveraging those locations has enabled us, as you can see, to keep our compensation expense growth well below the rate of growth in our employee base. On the non-compensation side, the biggest driver of the $2 million increase in our expenses was higher occupancy costs, which increased $1.8 million year-over-year. Most of that increase was the result of new leases that we have taken on as we prepared to consolidate our New York operations and shift locations of our Governance operations in Rockville, Maryland. We will be incurring double rent expense in both cities through the end of the third quarter as we complete the moves. To mitigate the impact of this expense, we are keeping a tight rein on other non-compensation expenses, like travel and entertainment. In fact, excluding the impact of higher occupancy costs, our non-compensation expense rose only 1%. Turning to our tax rate. Our tax rate in the quarter was 35.6%, down from 37.2% a year ago. And we are currently projecting a full year tax rate of approximately 36%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $102 million, down 2% from a year ago, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.5%. The FEA correction had the effect of lowering our reported adjusted EBITDA by $5.2 million and reducing our adjusted EBITDA margin by 1.2%. We had a very strong cash quarter in the first quarter of this year. We generated $70 million of operating cash flows in the quarter, up from negative $26 million a year ago.  Our capital expenditures were $4 million in the quarter, but we expect that number to increase, as we've discussed on previous calls, as we begin to incur the costs associated with the build-out of our new locations.  We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion of total debt outstanding and $460 million of cash and equivalents. To remind everyone, our current debt has an interest cost of 3.5%, consisting of a LIBOR floor of 100 basis points and a 250 basis point spread. And including swap expense and amortization of financing fees, our total interest cost, currently, is approximately 4.3%. We announced that we intend to issue $600 million of a 5-year term loan A facility and are pleased to announce that we've now upsized that deal to $880 million given strong demand. In addition, we are refinancing our $100 million revolving credit facility. We will use the proceeds of this new debt and approximately $200 million of cash on our balance sheet to repay our existing term loan B facility in full. We anticipate that our new senior term loan will have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% and no LIBOR floor for a total interest rate of approximately 2.6%. Our total interest cost, including swap expense and fee amortization, will be approximately 3.25% at current LIBOR rates. In addition, we anticipate future step-downs in the LIBOR spread based on further leverage reduction.  We are on track to close our refinancing at the end of this week, but note that it remains subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. We anticipate that this transaction, as I've talked about above, will result in a run rate interest savings of approximately 100 basis points on the $880 million of new debt versus our existing facility and a 350 basis point savings on the $200 million of debt reduction for a total run rate cash interest savings of approximately $16 million. Finally, we also expect to incur a nonrecurring and mainly noncash expense of $18 million to $20 million in the second quarter of this year, mainly from the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and the original issued discount relating to our existing term loan B facility and revolving credit facility, which we are paying off. This cost will be expense for GAAP EPS purposes and added back for adjusted EPS purposes. And with that, we would be happy to open the lines and take any questions you might have. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I have a question from Suzi Stein of Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: At the end of last year, you had an environment where people were delaying the purchase of new products in risk management. Have you seen that start to reverse since the market has rebounded?
Henry A. Fernandez: Not much, Suzi. I think the environment continues to be one -- for us, continues to be one that on the sales front, not a lot of items are out of the pipeline, but the pipeline continues to be fairly flexible in which some items get delayed to the next quarter and so on and so forth. So not a lot of change from the last 2 quarters of 2011. This environment began to happen right around May of last year when the sovereign debt crisis in Europe began to percolate. And therefore, for the last 6 months of 2011 and the first quarter of this year and the current quarter, it remains largely unchanged. Secondly though, I'd like to add that we continue to see, as I've said earlier, a fairly robust environment for retention rates of all of our products, which is a tribute to the mission criticality of a lot of what we do for clients.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then can you just give a little more detail on the February rollout of the Barra Portfolio Manager upgrade? What has the customer feedback been? And do you expect this to be a growth driver? Or is it more of a retention tool?
Henry A. Fernandez: We -- the initial feedback has been pretty positive because as you may remember, the plan is to have pretty much all the functionality that exists in Aegis, which is a client-deployed software in the PMA business. So we put all of that functionality in BPM, which is MSCI-hosted software platform or ASP solution. So we are -- the first release of this, about a year ago, was maybe 1/3 of the way. The second release gets us about 2/3 or 3/4 of the way of putting all that functionality. And we're targeting another large release in the end of -- by the end of the year, which gets us to maybe 85%, 90% or higher of the functionality. So the feedback from clients has been very good in that roadmap. In terms of sales for this new product, I think they're going to be both. It's going to be, one, to transfer a lot of clients that are currently in Aegis to BPM as the functionality meets their needs. And then secondly, we are already seeing demand from new clients and new use cases within the same clients for these new easier to use and less costly software platform.
Operator: Our next question is from Georgios Mihalos of Crédit Suisse.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was hoping to delve into your pipeline for ETF activity. Maybe give us a sense as to how the conversations are going with the existing providers you service. And maybe just sort of high level, give us a flavor for maybe some of the conversations you may be having with providers looking to get into the market and just thoughts around pricing there.
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. On the -- in the current pipeline, as you saw in the first quarter, it remains about the same from last year in terms of new product introductions. Actually, we're very pleased to announce that last Monday, 2 days ago, we launched a new ETF on MSCI Korea managed by Samsung Asset Management in Korea. So that's an example of the expansion of ETF. Last week, there was an announcement also that a few asset management companies from China were able to get regulatory approval from the Chinese authorities to launch MSCI A share ETFs in Hong Kong later on this year. So again, another expansion of our ETF business, in this case both in Asia, which is an area that we're very, very, very focused on. So -- now we don't know ultimately how -- with this environment, what the eventual plans of ETF sponsors in terms of rollout of products. What we see currently is a lot of excitement about this product line and therefore, a continuation of launches of new products. In terms of new entrants to the marketplace, obviously, most of them come to us to license our indices for the launch of ETFs. And there are many of them who have very unique distribution strategy or very unique set of criteria and therefore, they want to remain price competitive, so to speak, and they're all the ones that may want to use their product line to really compete solely on price and bring down fees. And we're less hoping or willing to work with many of those.
Georgios Mihalos - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then last question for me, you guys had a fair amount of time speaking about the Governance business and they have performed, obviously, very well here in the first quarter. I think in the past, Henry, you referred to that as being more of a financial asset than a strategic asset. Has that now turned the corner? Is Governance more strategic than MSCI?
Henry A. Fernandez: I think we are in that transition. Our view is that this business, the Governance business, which is -- the majority of its revenues are driven by proxy advisory and proxy voting and proxy distribution. And that's a business that is more mature in the West. There are initiatives around the world to either shame asset managers and institutional investors or make them comply with voting rules and if so, there will be growth associated with that. But the business is more mature and it's a little bit cyclical and it's obviously a bit more competitive. So our plan is, and our belief is, that this business can -- given the footprint that we have, given the expertise that we have, can launch a wide variety of products over time to make those products very essential to the investment process of our clients. And therefore, if we are able to achieve that transformation over time, then we believe that this business become pretty hardcore to what we do. An evidence of what the potential of this business can be is this new compensation data, our executive compensation data analytics product that we launched last summer in which it has performed exceedingly well in generating new sales for us in the segment. And it really is a path to the development of other products that can be essential to either issuers of capital, in this case corporations, or the users or the suppliers of capital and the institutional investors and their asset managers. So again, we believe that this business, which initially was clearly known for, as we called it at the time, can go through that transformation. And if we're able to do that, it will become part -- a very strong part and parcel of what we do, and we're very bullish on that. But obviously, time will tell as to whether we can execute against that vision.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Warmington of Raymond James.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I don't know if you could please comment on the competitive dynamic within the risk and portfolio model segment and specifically on Bloomberg's Newport product for the smaller clients and then also BlackRock Solutions as MSCI moves more into the fixed income side?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes, I think there are -- in what you're describing, there are 3 very distinct and separate segments. There is fixed income portfolio management products, which we don't really play a large role in. And there is fixed income either indices or fixed income management analytics, so the fixed income portfolio management or the fixed income front office. We don't play a large role in that market, and we're not making any significant investments at this point to play a large role in that market. The -- in terms of overall enterprise, why multi-asset class, risk management and solutions, which is a significant part of what we do with the RiskMetrics product line and the BarraOne product line, that the $258 million of revenue, that $258 million of run rate that we mentioned earlier, that is very much a core of our growth strategy and the like. And we continue to be the leading supplier of analytics on that on a multi-asset class and we, for sure, are strengthening our fixed income offering in the context of a multi-asset class setting, the same way that we're strengthening our alternative asset class offering in the context of the multi-asset class setting with new models and capabilities in hedge funds and private equities and in real estate and the like. So that continues to be a big effort on our part. And we're very pleased with the merger, so to speak, 2 years ago, of the RiskMetrics and BarraOne. We're very pleased with what we've been able to do in all client segments. I mentioned, obviously, a large penetration of the wealth management segment in the U.S. And that bodes well for us to then begin to penetrate wealth management in other parts of the world, where we're not as prevalent. We penetrated, very strongly, the asset owner community, especially pension funds in the U.S., but also in other selected areas around the world like in Japan and some places in Europe. And we continue to do well in this space in hedge funds, obviously, at a smaller click than we did back in '07 and the beginning of '08. So this is a -- it is a major area for us to build a big part of our business, and we're pretty good in what we do. And the competitive landscape is -- it hasn't changed much in the last 6 to 12 months from prior calls. And our bet is that -- is the competition will increase in this space over time, but we feel that we are -- we have the right products, the right distribution, the right service, we're nimble enough, the right investment, to compete and win in this space. Lastly, in the equity portfolio management space, obviously, that's a business -- that's the core of the old Barra, so to speak. And that's the $118 million of run rate that we mentioned earlier. That is a market that became competitive a year or 2 ago. We had an adjustment to that competitive landscape for a few quarters, but we're now feeling very good about our ability to compete and win in that space. There are quite a number of bake-off that would be in competition and we have won. And there's been quite a lot of takeaways from other competitors in that space, and we continue to do that. We're putting a lot of effort into this. We're putting a lot of new product development into this, and we intend to compete and win in this space.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. I wanted to also ask one other question on, and if you could comment on the M&A pipeline that you're seeing in the context of your upsized line of credit.
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes, I think we -- as we have always said to -- in these calls and in prior discussions, in investment conferences and the like, we always want to manage a tight balance between accumulating excess cash in our balance sheet and looking for M&A opportunities. There are lot of companies out there that have accumulated enormous amount of excess cash, and they're not deploying them currently for acquisitions and, therefore, have significant memory [ph] to carry on them or low returns on their equity. So we're trying to be a lot more optimal. I'm trying to be a lot more disciplined about that in terms of when the excess cash accumulates to certain level, and we don't see much of an M&A pipeline to return, to pay down debt with that cash. And we've done it twice now. We did it last year, I think around this time. And $80 million, I think, David, at that time. And we're doing it now with larger balances of $200 million. But keep in mind that we -- even though we're paying $200 million, we still have $260 million left. And given the huge amount of cash generation in our company relative to our size and competitors, we feel that cash will accumulate fast again to allow us to have the financial resources to do small- and medium-sized acquisitions if they come. In terms of the pipeline, and we see a lot. We are very much in the deal flow. We are extremely disciplined buyers in terms of whatever we buy has to be in our backyard. There has to be a large cost reduction component to that. It's got to follow a strategic plan of accelerating our growth plans in a particular area as opposed to looking for diversifying acquisitions or far afield acquisitions in other areas, we're not as interested in those. We're hoping that as the markets turn over time, that the sweet spot to M&A comes in, which is when people realize that we're no longer in a tough market but the values are still lagging and people then will want more often to sell at a reasonable price. And therefore, we want to be there to balance if the opportunities are there and have the financial resources to do that, but we're not seeing that yet.
David M. Obstler: And just to amplify a little bit of what we did on the refinancing, we had a just under $1.1 billion credit facility. And what we've done by this refinancing is to refinance it with just under $900 million of drawn and then to use $200 million of our cash. That lowers the interest rate and, as Henry mentioned, reduces the cash balance to around $260 million while still preserving that amount in cash balance for the flexibility that Henry mentioned.
Operator: Our next question is from Jennifer Huang of UBS.
Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can you maybe provide us with some more color. I know you talked about the pipeline being roughly unchanged from a quarter or 2 ago, but is there any more color around this particular client segment in terms of asset managers, along on the asset managers versus hedge funds or versus pension funds? Maybe just a color there?
David M. Obstler: Yes, and it goes by product as well. Each of our segments have taken turns in terms of sales having some leadership. As we mentioned this quarter, we had a very strong performance from wealth managers and from asset owners. Our pipeline continues to be quite diversified. We have solid pipeline with asset managers, with hedge funds, with banks, et cetera. And what we have been finding is that based on what comes in each quarter, 1 segment takes or 2 segments take the lead versus the others. But we continue to have a very diversified pipeline across these segments and also geographically.
Henry A. Fernandez: The other thing I would add is that Europe, a lot of people look at the headlines in the newspapers and think of Europe as being in a basket case, right? And for us, it has been fairly steady, not great but not bad, fairly steady and solid that would just clearly attribute to the criticality of many of our products, to the secular demand of many of our products even in the face of extremely tight budgets for asset managers in Europe. So that has been a pleasant surprise for us in the last few quarters.
Jennifer Huang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. And then maybe as a follow-up, you pointed out strategy in the fees -- in the ETF business, like gaining acceptance globally. Can you talk about just the overall marketplace for these sort of newer generation strategy indices and then the ETFs on top of those?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes. I think that what is happening is that clients, in the form of institutional investors, asset owners and therefore forcing their asset manager clients, look at alternative means to do their strategic asset allocation or even their tactical asset allocation. So they are going from what I would call a market beta approach of looking at the entire equity world and slice it and dice it according to market capitalization weighted betas and either invest passively or give up assets or mandates to active managers to beat that beta to an environment, in which the margin -- they're looking to see if other alternative strategies would also work. And they come in many flavors. They either are a risk reduction, volatility reduction strategies in which they say, "Can we achieve the same level of return in the market with lower volatility or even lower risk?" And we've done an extensive amount of work and are a leader in that space in providing that research and the consequence that indices have go with that to the marketplace. So therefore, a few of these institutional investors and asset owners have picked MSCI indices without -- with this methodology and have mandated or given mandates to asset managers to manage money along those lines. And we have picked up basis point contracts with them. Clearly, another variation of this is, should you be waiting your investment strategy instead of market capitalization and instead of risk reduction or volatility control, one can be weighted on the basis of fundamental factors going on in the marketplace, in the book-to-value and things like that or earnings or revenues or whatever as opposed to price, as opposed to market capitalization. And we've been very active in that space as well with our indices. So those are examples of what is happening. And therefore, the index industry, the index provision, the index supplier industry has been looking at that new evolution of the market as to going from provision of indices just on the basis of market beta to investment strategy beta indices. And it's pretty exciting. We're a leader in that space currently and remains -- clearly are very focused on remaining a leader. And I think that is going to bode well. It's starting in a lot of ways in the institutional market with their asset managers, but it's also beginning to go into ETFs and other form of passive retail funds and the like.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Riggs of William Blair.
Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just a couple of quick questions around the sales force. Have you made or have you contemplated making any changes to the structure or the incentives for the sales force to help them better seek out the pockets of money at existing clients or new clients?
Henry A. Fernandez: We haven't made any organizational changes, in wholesale organizational changes, and we have not changed the compensation structure of our sales force. And on the compensation structure, we don't intend to do that. There are no plans, no discussions to do that. What we have done in the last few quarters is -- like we always do, is make marginal shifts of resources from either products or client segment where there is a bit less opportunity to products or, on client segments where we find better opportunities. So obviously, we have beefed up our sales to our sales force to asset owners around the world. We have beefed up sales to wealth managers, as we mentioned before, around the world. We have actually put a lot of emphasis on sales of PMA products to equity, long/short hedge funds and the like. We obviously are very bullish in parts of Asia, so just Korea with establishment of the office. We recently announced the hiring of a managing director from one of the key asset management companies to be the head of our office there in Korea, and so on and so forth. So those are the shifts that we're looking to do now. In addition to that, we are also very focused on finding new clients in all areas, either new asset manager client that we haven't had a dialogue with or new geographies. And we're also focused on increasing the cross-selling to a lot of our clients in this environment to continue to generate growth in sales. The last thing that I will say, and that was a little bit of my reference to the emerging market clients at the beginning of my prepared remarks. And I am very focused personally on figuring out a wider strategy that we can execute on to cover our emerging market clients much better and -- in a much better and maybe in a different way in order to generate growth there. We have been very successful over the past decades on creating emerging market products that gets all to developed market investors. We have been exceedingly successful of locating large amounts of our staff to emerging market centers. That's the 40 percentage versus 32% a year ago. And we're now focused on emerging market clients, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and asset managers and hedge funds, the broker dealers and the like. We're ready to do that, but we want to do it in a much bigger way.
Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Great. And just how has attrition and hiring trended kind of in line with your expectations?
Henry A. Fernandez: It's very much as expected. At this time of the year, the first quarter or 2 are clearly where if their bonuses get paid and promotions get done. It's where you see a little more movement. And you'll probably see there is a slight growth in our headcount from the end of the year to the first quarter, and that's because we also, on a net basis, continue to grow by a bit mostly in emerging market centers. So the attrition, when a -- clearly, no attrition is welcome, right, but when it is, when it does come, we'll take an opportunity to revisit where should that function be located and more often than not, we're pushing for that function to be located in emerging market centers.
Operator: Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore Partners.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Can you please provide us an update on BlackRock's efforts to get SEC approval to start their own proprietary indices?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yes -- no, absolutely no change whatsoever, no new information, no change to what we've discussed in the past. I would like to add though is that we have an extremely tight and great relationship with BlackRock at all levels in all of their company but especially at the iShare level. And therefore, there's no, no change, there's no -- nothing new to report.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.
Edings Thibault: Well, thank you, very much Tyrone. And thank you very much, everyone, for joining us. Please feel free to join us again next quarter for another update on our results. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MSCI Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Shawn. Good morning, and thank you for joining our fiscal year and fourth quarter 2011 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning, we issued a press release describing our results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter 2011. A copy of that release can be viewed on our website at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. This presentation may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date in which they are made, which reflects management’s current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending November 30, 2010 and on our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2011. Today’s earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following. Third-party transaction expenses resulting from the acquisition of risk metrics, restructuring costs related to the acquisition of risk metrics and non-recurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EPS also excludes the amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and debt repayment and refinancing expenses. Please refer to today’s earnings release for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will be referring to run rates frequently in our discussion this morning. so let me remind you that our run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking fees for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETFs license to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to table 10 in our press release for a detailed explanation. Henry Fernandez will begin the discussion this morning with an overview of the fourth quarter and then David Obstler will provide some details on our financial results. In the case of financial accounting metrics, the discussion of the fiscal year numbers will focus on pro forma results, which assume the acquisition of risk metrics occurred at the beginning of MSCI’s 2010 fiscal year. Pro forma, fiscal year 2010 includes MSCI’s results for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2010 and risk metrics fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009 and first quarter ended March 31, 2010. As a reminder, MSCI’s acquisition of risk metrics took place on June 1, 2010, the first day of MSCI’s 2010 fiscal third quarter. All operating metrics as distinct from financial accounting metrics have been restated to reflect MSCI’s results on a combined basis during the comparable period in 2010. That means all quarterly operating metrics reflect the calendar quarter or 12 months indicated rather than the prior fiscal period. I’ll now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry A. Fernandez: Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Earlier this morning we reported 2011 revenue of $901 million and adjusted EBITDA of $419 million, up 10% and 17% respectively from pro forma 2010. MSCI full year adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 46.5% from 43.7% in pro forma 2010. MSCI’s 2011 adjusted EPS rose 36% year-over-year to $1.85. For the fourth quarter MSCI reported revenues of $226 million, up 6% versus fourth quarter 2010. Adjusted EBITDA of $104 million, up 5% year-over-year and adjusted EPS of $0.45 up 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.8%, down from 46.4% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our fourth quarter run rate rose 7% year-over-year to $882 million. The increase in the run rate was primarily driven by continued growth in the subscription run rate, offsetting part by slower growth in asset-based fees including the fees from Exchange Traded Funds. From an operating perspective, MSCI continue to perform well despite an uncertain and difficult operating environment globally. We saw healthy growth in subscription sales and our cancellations continue to decline on a year-over-year basis. Total sales for the quarter were $43 million, down from $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. New recurring subscription sales rose 5% to $35 million. By client type, our recurring subscription sales to our asset owner client and to our corporate client were strong and we saw very good sales to alternative investment managers including hedge funds and funds of funds. Sales to asset management clients and to banks remained steady during the quarter. Our retention rates rose again to 85% from 82% a year ago. Our total cancellations declined by 10% year-over-year. As a reminder it is important to look at our retention rates on a year-over-year basis because of the seasonality in our retention rates. As you know our retention rates declined typically on a sequential basis from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as a result of a greater percentage of our business that is up for renewal during that period in the fourth quarter. For the full-year MSCI’s retention rate was 90%, up from 87% in 2010. It is encouraging to note that our cancellations continue to decline in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the year, even as financial market became more volatile, economic uncertainties increased and our overall operating environment got more challenging. With the growth in recurring subscription sales are under declining cancellations therefore, our net new subscription sales more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2010 to $8 million. That growth in subscription sales was partially offset by a $2 million decline in run rate resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter. Netting all those changes, our subscription run rate at the end of the fourth quarter was $762 million, up 8% year-over-year and 0.5% sequentially. With that overview now, let us take a look at each one of our major product line. Our Index and ESG business reported revenues of $101 million, up 11% from the fourth quarter, and a run rate of $389 million, up 10% year-over-year. Total Index and ESG sales sell 11% year-over-year to $50 million. New recurring subscription sales rose 6% to $12 million. Gains in sales of index products, especially benchmark and financial products were partially offset by a decline in sales of ESG products. Cancellations rose by $1 million to $6 million. Our quarterly retention rate dipped slightly to 89% from 90%. Index and ESG subscription run rate was $270 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 2% from September 2011. Asset-based fee run rate rose 2% year-over-year to $120 million, despite a decline in ETF assets under management linked to our indices. The increase in run rate was driven by an increase in fees collective on other types of financial products such as [pension] funds and listed features and options, which more than offset a decline in ETF run rate during that comparison period. At the end of 2011, there were $302 billion of AUM in ETFs linked to our indices, down $32 billion or 10% compared to the end of 2010. Over the course of 2011, we have experienced significant volatility in the level of AUM of ETFs linked to indices. We experienced a strong growth in the first half of the year with AUM climbing and peaking at $371 billion at the end of April before bottoming out at $290 billion at the end of September. AUM levels recovered modestly in the fourth quarter raising $12 billion. Most of the fourth quarter gains resulted from market moves rather than net inflows, which were about $1 billion. For the full-year, the average AUM and ETF’s linked to our indices was $334 billion. As most of you know, on the second business day of each month, we publish the AUM or ETFs linked to our indices for the prior month on msci.com. Those numbers will be posted to our website after the close of today’s market, but let me share them with you now. At the end of January, just a few days ago, there were $334 billion in AUM in ETFs linked to our indices, up 11% from the end of the fourth quarter. Approximately one third of the increase in AUM has been the result of positive net flows into these ETFs linked to our indices. During the quarter, at the end of the quarter, the average basis points in the ETFs linked to our indices dropped slightly from 3.1 basis points at the end of September to 3.0 basis points. On a relative basis, the out performance of ETFs linked to our U.S. market indices, which accounted for 24% of the total AUM at the end of December contributed to that modest decline in the average basis point C. Revenues for our risk management analytics business were $62 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The risk management analytics run rate of $251 million grew 8% year-over-year. Changes in foreign currency rates especially the strengthening of the dollar against the euro during the quarter reduced the risk management analytics run rate by $2 million. Total risk management analytic sales were $14 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% year-over-year, but up 10% sequentially from the third quarter. New recurring subscription sales were $12 million. We experienced solid demand from asset managers, hedge funds, asset owners and funds of funds offset by weaker demand from banks and broker dealers where budget prices remain intense. Risk management analytics cancellation rose to $11 million in the fourth quarter and our retention rate dropped to 81%. For the full year, cancellations declined 7% and the retention rate rose to 90% from 86% in 2010. As we have discussed in the past, risk management analytic sales tend to be bigger, [junkier] and more volatile than in any one of our other major product lines. The same is true of cancellations. In the fourth quarter of 2011, our largest cancel was driven by a client consolidation, a merger that had taken place two years ago that eventually declined ended up consolidating, and the second largest cancel was the result of a bankruptcy that we all know about. Both were in the banks and broker dealer segment. Based on our current pipeline, we do not believe that the fourth quarter increasing cancellations represent the beginning of any significant acceleration in cancellations in our risk management analytics product line. We continue to work hard to cement our position as an innovation leader in multi-asset class risk analytics. During the quarter, we launched an upgraded version of the analytics underlying our flagship risk manager product. The new version enhances our coverage of complex deliveries increases our coverage of new fixed income instruments and contains enhancements to our counterparty credit risk capabilities. We also upgraded the hardware underpinning Barra 1 product resulting in significant performance improvement. Our portfolio management analytics business continued on its road to recovery. revenues were $30 million, down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2010. Run rate, on the other hand, grew by 3% to $118 million. Recurring subscription sales were $4 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2010. Retention rates continued to recover rising to 87% in the fourth quarter from 63% a year ago, as a result of a 67% declining cancellations. For all of 2011, the retention rate in this business rose to 88% from 80%. The reinvigoration of the Barra product line continues. Over the course of 2011, we benefited from the launch of several new generation risk models as well as from the launch in the end of 2010 of our new Barra portfolio manager software platform. These products help our overall sales for years and play a very important role in the increase in retention rates. We have several more product launches scheduled for the first quarter including upgraded functionality for Barra Portfolio Manager, a new global Equity Model and two single-country models. There will be more to come over the balance of 2012 including more models and further additions to the software Barra Portfolio Manager. We are also pleased that the progress we are making in restoring our government business to grow. Revenues were $29 million in the fourth quarter, up 1% from the prior year. Run rate increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially to $108 million. Total government sales rose 13% year-over-year to $9 million led by sales of Proxy Research and Voting products. New recurring subscription sales rose 60% to $7 million as we saw growth in both of our major product lines there ISS Institutional and ISS Corporate. In the latter category, we had strong sales of our new corporate compensation products. One of the first decisions we made up on acquiring the ISS business was to invest in the sales force and in account management. And we see that decision is starting to pay off in the form of an 11% increase in 2011 total sales. Cancellations in the business declined by 5% to $5 million and our retention rates rose slightly to 81%. For the full year our retention rates rose to 86% from 84% as total cancel fell by 10%. At the beginning of 2011, we noted that we expected to make certain investments in our business over the course of 2011, mostly in the form of increased headcount. We added a total of 330 new positions over the course of 2011, mostly in emerging market centers. The primary focus of our investments were in the front office where we expanded our distribution capabilities and bolster our client service and consultant services to clients. And we also made investments in our both management and development areas and our technology functions. By business, the biggest beneficiary of our newest spending in 2011 were in Index and ESG, in portfolio management analytics and in risk management analytics. We expect the pace of headcount additions to moderate in 2012. To sum up, MSCI reported positive operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 despite the impact of increased economic uncertainty, weaker financial markets and a challenging operating environment for most of our businesses. We believe that the investments we have made over the course of 2011 and we will continue to make some in the course of 2012 will position us very well to benefit from the strong secular growth drivers underpinning our business and will enable us overtime to drive top line revenue growth. I will now turn over to David Obstler for some additional comment.
David M. Obstler:  Thank you Henry. MSCI reported revenues of $226 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $901 million for the fiscal year. MSCI’s fourth quarter revenue growth was driven by a 10% growth in Index and ESG product revenues, and a 7% growth in risk management analytics revenues. These gains were offset by a 3% decline in portfolio management analytics revenues. By type of revenue, subscription revenues grew by 7%, asset-based fees grew by 9% year-over-year and non-recurring revenues fell by 35% or $3 million. By segment, performance and risk revenues grew by 7% year-over-year to $198 million in the fourth quarter and governance revenues increased by 1% to $29 million. Overall, adjusted EBITDA expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, non-recurring stock-based compensation and restructuring costs rose 7% year-over-year to $122 million. Our compensation costs rose by 8% to $85 million. During the fourth quarter, we reduced our annual bonus accrual to reflect the slowdown in our growth in the second half of the year resulting in a roughly $3 million reduction in compensation expense in the fourth quarter. Our non-compensation expense rose 4.5% year-over-year to $38 million. We generated a $104 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 5% from the fourth quarter of last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 45.8% from 46.4%. On a segment basis, performance and risk adjusted EBITDA grew 7% to $97 million in the fourth quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was flat at 49%. Governance adjusted EBITDA fell to $6.7 million from $8.4 million and the margin declined to 23.4% in the quarter from 29.6% last year. For the fiscal year 2011, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $418 million, an increase of 17% from pro forma 2010. MSCI’s adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 46.5% from 43.7% last year. Performance and risk adjusted EBITDA rose 19% to $387 million and governance adjusted EBITDA declined 3% to $31 million. We incurred $11.5 million of other expense in the fourth quarter, most of which was interest expense related to our debt. Our interest expense declined the fourth quarter of last year as we realized the benefits of lower levels of outstanding debt and lower interest costs resulting from the repricing of our debt during the first quarter of 2011. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $38 million of our term loan facility. The repayment is expected to trigger a decline in MSCI’s applicable margin above LIBOR to 2.5% from 2.75% when MSCI files its Annual Report for fiscal 2011. That should result in a decline in our interest expenses by 25 basis points. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 36.6%. For fiscal 2011 the tax rate was 34.2%. The fiscal year 2011 tax rate benefited amongst other things from the recognition in the third quarter of two non-recurring tax benefits discussed in our last call totaling $4.2 million. Excluding those benefits, the fiscal tax rate for 2011 would have been 35.7%. At the close of 2011, our operating tax rate excluding discrete items is approximately 36% to 36.5%. Fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.36 per share up from $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Our adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the after-tax per share impacts of restructuring costs, non-recurring stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangibles, transaction expenses, and debt repayment and refinancing costs was $0.45 per share, up 25% from $0.36 in the fourth quarter of last year. MSCI’s fiscal GAAP [EPS] diluted EPS for the year was $1.41, up from $0.81 per share in the fiscal year of last year. Our fiscal 2011 adjusted EPS was $1.85, up 37% from last year. During the fourth quarter, MSCI generated $80 million of operating cash flow, up from $62 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Our operating cash flow for the fiscal year was $255 million, up from $183 million last year. Capital expenditures were $6 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million for the full fiscal year. We will be making investments in our physical infrastructure in 2011. One of the key drivers of this is the shift in our New York offices. Because our lease is expiring at our present location we will consolidate our two New York operations into a single facility in the third quarter of 2012. as a result, we will be spending approximately $25 million to $30 million on facility build outs in 2012, the largest of which is New York, with approximately $10 million to $12 million of that pay for buyer landlord. As a result, we expect our growth capital expenditures to be around $15 million in 2012 and the net spend to be in the range of $33 million to $40 million. It is of important to note that this level of capital expenditures does not represent a new norm, and we would anticipate a drop in CapEx in 2013. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.1 billion of total debt outstanding of which roughly 40% is swapped in fixed rate instruments. We also had $393 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on our balance sheet. Finally, our quarterly weighted average fully diluted share count was $122.5 million up from $122.3 million in the third quarter and from a $121.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. With that, we will be happy to take any of the questions that you might have. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from George Mihalos from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
George Mihalos – Credit Suisse: A couple of questions, starting off on the retention side. Henry, I think you called out two sort of one-time or non-recurring events on the risk side. Do you happen to have the retention rate X those two losses? And then, also can you comment a little bit about the retention rate in the Index business. I know, we got to look at a year-over-year and it’s seasonal, but it seemed a little bit weaker, given the strength that you’ve seen over the first three quarters. Can you comment a little bit what you saw there?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yeah. Those two losses accounted for approximately $2.5 million, which would have increased the retention rate by a couple of percentage points on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, I believe that would be about 4% to 5%.
George Mihalos – Credit Suisse: And sorry, on the index side...
Henry A. Fernandez: On the index side, David correct me, but I think the retention rate that we’re showing is combined Index and ESG.
David M. Obstler: Right.
Henry A. Fernandez: And what it is slowly the slight decrease on the combined retention rate George, is mostly attributed, if not all of it attributed to the ESG retention rate rather than the Index business, the index subscription business, which remains pretty healthy. what happened was just to put something in context was when we acquire those metrics, those metrics have recently made a variety of acquisitions in the ESG space was spend to better part of the last part of 2010 and the first part of 2011 consolidating products and rationalizing the operation and that resulted in certain clients that cancel their subscription, some of it was things that we wanted to endorse, given the new product line and some of it obviously was always voluntary. So that’s, I would not read too much into that drop in the retention rate on the Index business and we believe that the drop and the retention rate in ESG were temporarily and is now back to more normal levels.
David M. Obstler: The benchmark itself had relatively flat cancellations from – in the fourth quarter of this year versus last year with net, which means on a growing business actually the retention rate would have increased in the date and benchmark side of the business.
George Mihalos – Credit Suisse: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then just last question, can you talk a little bit about the selling environment and maybe talk a little bit about you’re seeing in the U.S. versus Europe?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yeah. I think we are putting it into context; we started the last – the first two quarters of 2011 up until April or May. I’m feeling pretty good that the environment and the budget of clients were beginning to relax and things were gradually were going to begin to be better for us. And then sometime in May, I think it was, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe began to raise its head. And then from then on, from May through September, the selling environment became pretty challenging and difficult and, but we kept selling on a healthy basis during that period. Importantly, a lot of what we had in the pipeline during that period, all the way to December alarming was delay, so the challenging environment caused delays in the selling of products rather than outright deletions from our pipeline during that period, that trend continuous in January, so there is no fundamental change. As to geographic areas, we actually have done okay in Europe relative to the environment, our levels of sales have been satisfactory I would call them. They are not bad in any sense and that has been positive surprise for us. And sales into the U.S. has been healthy and a little stronger than the expectations because clearly the recovery of the U.S. market. But they are not in any kind of strong pace at all social client segment clearly the banks and the broker dealers are challenging for us and for anybody else who are selling into land both in sales and cancels, and we saw a recovery at the end of December in sales into hedge funds, risk management analytics, which was good because of what we pointed out in the third quarter, and our sales of hedge fund transparency products, this is as a result of the Measurisk acquisition that we made in December of 2010. Those will began to gather pace, they are largely to funds of funds and other investors in hedge fund and we feel pretty good about that product and build sales.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Riggs with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company, LLC: All right, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just an extension of about last question on the sales force, Henry, you have made some investments in headcount there you said that the headcount overall hiring were moderate and a little bit in 2012, can you just kind of comment in general about your plans for hiring as far as the sales force goes and then as an extension of that recent successes that you had with the sales force, can you bucket or maybe point out some trends. Are you having success because in general you think you have more effective coverage, have a recent hires, ramps up fuller rate of productivity or are you really starting to benefit from the new product introductions, thanks.
Henry A. Fernandez: Good question, and I think the one of the biggest benefits in 2011 in the growth of our, in our headcount investment in the client organization was in retention. We purposely invested significantly in headcount in our client service centers that are mostly if not largely located in emerging market centers and that client service investment has helped us establish a strong dialog with clients that have progress up for renewal been able to service them at a higher level of performance that we had in the past, and on the like and that has helped us maintain a fairly healthy rate of renewals, if anything in certain product lines the retention rates that we have especially in certain Index products are historically high levels, which is not what you would have expected in an environment like this, and therefore we are very pleased with that. Another part of the investments we made are in what we call consultant, which are people that are located in financial centers London, New York, Hong Kong and [light], there are people that help us train clients, it will take clients in the use of analytics products, not so much index products, analytics products and that has helped those to retain clients and increase the retention rate. With respect to up to sales, we benefited, we opened up sales presence in Toronto and Canada. We step up efforts with Korean clients. We actually opened up an office in Korea, a couple of weeks ago and we made announcement, press release at the time. So then what we are trying to do is marginally going to clearly new areas where we believe customers have budget to spend and those are the markets whose economies are doing better than that and the countries that are doing better than that such as Canada. So that has been – we benefited from that as well. So those were some of the efforts on the sales side. On the products side, a lot of the investments in products that we made in the last six months are not yet on the sales, they’re not on the sales numbers and on the sales pipeline, because obviously there is a lag effect on that. So for example, we’re making some investments, not large, but we’re making some investments in performance attribution for their risk management analytics business, in alternative, and be modeling of alternative investment for risk management, for patient funds and fixed income instrument for a lot of our asset managers and in high volume processing for our wealth manager clients. That’s a new area, wealth management has been a good area for us to expand sales we’ve been pretty happy with the performance on that. And lastly, I’d like to emphasize again that in the last two quarters, there have been two products that are compared to the first two quarters of the year that we outperform in our expectations. One is the hedge fund transparency risk product, again otherwise called measured risk, that’s the acquisition we made and that is risk management, a capability for investors in hedge funds. And the second product was back I think in the early summer, we'll launch a new executive compensation data, service and analytics in light of ISS and that has been a phenomenal, successful in the – on a relative basis right in the last two quarters and we expect both of those products to continue well in 2012.
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company, LLC: Great, thank you, Henry.
Henry A. Fernandez: Anything else Dave? Anything else to add to that David?
David M. Obstler: Yeah. I think in the – with workers’ compensation line, we got about sort of about $2.5 million; it’s the second quarter out. So we’re experiencing some pretty strong momentum in that area?
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company, LLC: Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Tog with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: Thank you. Good morning, David and Henry.
Henry A. Fernandez: Good morning.
David M. Obstler: Good morning.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: Can you bracket David, your 2012 headcount growth target and also give us a breakdown of what parts of the business the new employees will go into?
David M. Obstler: We don't put headcount targets out. But as Henry mentioned, we've been investing in a combination of our front-office, sales and distribution, our product creation and IP, and another infrastructure support with a concentration in investing in the emerging markets except for the clients facing in sales organization that focuses more on the financial markets and we see more of that in 2012, as Henry mentioned though lesser rate of growth than we had in 2011. And that the other things is at the in order to plans for 2012 in terms of headcount growth and obviously a moderation from the levels of 2011. we are going and take them a quarter at a time depending on the performance of the business in this quarter, given the environment, if the environment gets better, we’ll look to expand a spend a little more, if the environment states about the same, we’d be more restrained on that effort. and as we said, we always have a – we have a balancing out in terms of putting a meaningful part of our investment in sales and client service for new sales on those new products pretension purposes, because those investments stay back right away. It’s a very quick return on that. And an investment in people that are building new products that typically is a lag by a year or two or three in terms of building up the sales on those new products. So we tend to be cautious about those in environments like this clearly, but we are committed that on a year-over-year basis, we continue to put up – put new products and new services to clients even if obviously the environment is difficult.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: Can you give us some insights into a non-comp expense for 2012 particularly SG&A?
David M. Obstler: Again, we don't give guidance, but we have as a matter of course worked on controlling our non-comp expenses in our largest areas, market data, IT infrastructure et cetera. We’ll continue to do that in 2012.
Henry A. Fernandez: We’ll not see much of this in any kind of meaningful significant growth in non-comp expenses in 2012, with the exception of the occupancy line, especially because in our New York office, we’re currently in two locations. We are loosing the lease in the health quarter location by all those. We made an announcement that we’re moving to a 7 World Trade Center hopefully sometime in July in a faced approach. And therefore for most of the year, we’re going to have double rent, and that is going to obviously show up on the financial statements is all factoring into our budget and our analysis, but that will obviously increase a non-compensation expense lines by a bit.
David M. Obstler: Yeah, we locate our as Henry has mentioned, our occupancy up into our cost items. So that will be spread and have working on a number of other cost initiatives and the other non-comp areas to help – pay for that increase in occupancy.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP. Please go ahead with your questions.
David Scharf – JMP Securities: Great, thank you for taking my question. Henry, maybe circling back another sort of high level question about the market out there. If we set aside just directionally where the markets have been going in the last few months and set aside even the dislocations in Europe right now, how should we be thinking about the secular growth outlooks for the core index business current market volumes that we’re seeing now? Actually end up being a new normal, I mean I know we all want to believe that once some of the overhangs out there are removed that market volumes will pick up. But as we think about that kind of demand out there particularly on the Index side, should we be focused as much on kind of the current volume outlook and whether or not this is a new secular benchmark or should we just be looking at kind of near-term fund formations?
Henry A. Fernandez: Yeah, I think it’s a good question and we actually spend a good amount of time within the company trying to differentiate strongly what is secular and what is cyclical? And I think starting with the overall business when you look at the totality of our business, the secular demand for what we do is theoretically is strong and getting a lot stronger. And the two crisis that we have had the financial crisis of ’08, ‘09 and the sovereign-debt crisis have enhanced that secular demand for what we do and that is the valuation of investments, asset management, risk management, governance, ESG and so on and so forth. So we’re pretty comfortable that’s kind of fundamental demand even in a new norm of a lower growth world is pretty good for us. If anything a low growth environment is going to put intense amount of pressure on asset owners and asset managers on fees to asset managers of all types and the transparency of those fees and the transparency of the return and the risk that investors are taking with the asset owners’ money. And a lot of clients have come to us and say that they need more tools from us to be able to understand what the actual performance of people are, and the attribution of that performance, and the risk that those people are taking on that performance in order to pay for alpha and not to pay for beta, that’s kind of a way to look at it. So that puts in a more added benefit to the secular demand of what we do. So when we look at our various businesses clearly that theoretical demand is heavily pitched right now or pinch I should say right, now by the budgets of clients in which they will like to get a lot of our tools, and get them in significant numbers. But they got to face the reality of the financial constraints that they have in their business and therefore they make room for us. Many of our clients’ budgets are flat to down and our share of their budget is increasing and they make room for our tools and they got us [squish] somebody else to do that. So what we believe is that as the world recovers even in a lower growth environment those budgets are going to get relaxed, maybe not totally to pre-oil once they get relaxed and as they get relaxed a lot of this bottled up demand for our products and services are going to start increasing the pace of activity for us, clearly at a higher level of what we have today. With respect to index itself, I think there is a little bit of a trade-off that may happen over time between sort of benchmark data sales. We see that continuing, but clearly the rate of fund, the rate of fund launches and new product launches and alike may slowdown, given the environment. And that may or may not have an impact on sales or benchmark. But we also see the money we’re making on passive management, which continues at an institutional level at the ETF level and therefore it creates two inches of growth for that. The third component is that it’s not big. And I don’t think it’s going to be big in the near future. But we continue to make inroads on generating revenues on derivative products, futures, options, structure products and the like that obviously is not a large number for us, but it adds up overtime. And that’s the third leg of the Index business that we’re trying to develop over the years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
William Warmington – Raymond James: A question for you, if you could update us with respect to the volume of cross-border institutional mandates in the U.S. you’re seeing and how your success rate is trending there?
Henry A. Fernandez: We don’t specifically track on a quantitative basis or frequent basis. The amount of cross-border investments per se in institutional landscape when we do look at the data there are two, three things that are very clear. And that is despite the volatility in emerging markets the allocation of pension fund money to emerging markets continues unabated. Even at times when people thought that the emerging markets were inflated because people make strategic asset allocations to asset classes and it’s very hard for them to time it, so they do whenever they feel that they need to make the strategic reallocation of assets, right. So we see that continues unabated. Secondly, they continues to be a trend for looking at the equity investment processes of this asset owners on a global basis, not on a U.S. versus developed markets versus emerging markets versus global small cap basis. And therefore in the past, we’ve talked a lot about the increasing number of institutional clients for us in the United States that are adopting our ACWI, an ACWI IMI benchmarks without any biases of emerging or developed or domestic or international and like that continues on a healthy clip. The benefit of that is that eventually the asset manager that is managing those assets for the asset owner is going to come back to us for more data regarding all of that including more domestic U.S. indices on the part of MSCI, which is in the past hasn’t been our (inaudible) in the U.S. market. For more emerging market data, for more and clearly more global small cap data, so that’s another trend. So I think the way I would place it to you in the institutional part of our business, not the retail, but institutional part of our business that I just don’t see any slowdown or aggression on the pace of globalization of people’s portfolios especially the allocation to emerging markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Hi, can you talk in general about the adoption of portfolio analytics over the past few years and your expectation on how that continues to play out? Have you converted customers that were more inclined to buy the products to begin with? So future sales could be more challenging or do you think the opportunity is still abundant?
David M. Obstler: I think Suzi, in the last 12 months, the story of the Barra business has been one relatively high levels of retention compared to 2010. A lot of that was fairly active dialog with our clients as to the roadmap of our analytics product, our software and our new models and description of what we’re trying to achieve. There’s been a lot of thought in leadership in the form of research seminars and a lot of sort of advise so to speak, not advise, but a lot of description of what we’re doing in our models and the like and the impacts of our models in the way they’re managing their portfolios and so on and so forth. So that has helped on the retention. The sales have remained at a good level, so that’s been good news in 2011, compared to 2010. But they haven’t accelerated quite dramatically either. So the net new has been very high, because of the drop of the significant decline in cancels. So we have, I think as I mentioned 3% growth in run rate. We expect that continue to remain steady or accelerate with a launch of a lot of new products. So a lot of the money we’re making currently at the incremental sales, we’re making our own models. And the benefits of BPM have not been fully flushed out on our sales, because obviously the first release of BPM was a good release, but it was for risk analysis. We’re now – I think this month in February, we are doing a major release of BPM that is going to include quite a lot of new functionality. And then we’re going to do another release towards the end of the year. So therefore, on the software side that’s going to help us increase the base of sales in that market. So the opportunity continues to be good. We believe that the overall market opportunity for Index and risk management analytics is much larger than for equity portfolio analytics. But we’re hoping that this business can go back to more pre-‘07 growth rates that we’ve enjoyed in the past.
Operator: I’m not showing any other questions in the queue. I’d like to turn it back over to Mr. Fernandez for closing comments.
Henry A. Fernandez: Well, thank you very much everyone for joining us. And I will be more than happy to take individual questions from anybody if you so this hour. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Analysts: Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley David Togut – Evercore Partners Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital David Scharf – JMP Securities
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MSCI Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investors Relations. You may begin.
Edings Thibault: Thank you very much operator, and I’m delighted to be joined this morning by Mr. Henry Fernandez, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MSCI and Mr. David Obstler, the Chief Financial Officer. Thank you all for joining us on our third quarter 2011 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning we issued a press release describing our results for the third quarter and nine months 2011. A copy of that release can be viewed on our website at MSCI.com under the Investor Relations tab. This presentation may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date in which they are made which reflects management’s current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended November 30, 2010 and on our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2011 that will be filed. Today’s earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following. Third-party transaction expenses resulting from the acquisition of risk metrics, restructuring costs related to the acquisition of risk metrics and non-recurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EPS also excludes the amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and debt repayment and refinancing expenses. Please refer to today’s earnings release for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures. We will be referring to run rates frequently in our discussion this morning, so let me remind you that our run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking fees for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months assuming no cancellations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETFs license to our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to table 10 in our press release for a detailed explanation. Henry Fernandez will begin the discussion this morning with an overview of the third quarter, and then David Obstler will provide some details on our financial results. In the case of financial accounting metrics, the discussion of the year-to-date numbers will focus on pro forma results which assume the acquisition of risk metrics occurred at the beginning of MSCI’s 2010 fiscal year. Pro forma nine months 2010 includes MSCI’s results for the nine months ended August 31, 2010 and risk metrics fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009 and first quarter ended March 31, 2010. As a reminder MSCI’s acquisition of risk metrics took place on June 1, 2010, the first day of MSCI’s 2010 fiscal third quarter. All operating metrics as distinct from financial accounting metrics have been restated to reflect MSCI’s results on a combined basis during the comparable period in 2010. That means all quarterly operating metrics reflect the calendar quarter or nine months indicated rather than the prior fiscal period. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Edings. Good morning and thank you for joining us. This morning we reported third quarter revenues of $225 million, adjusted EBITDA of $104 million and adjusted EPS of $0.49. Year-to-date we reported revenues of $675 million, adjusted EBITDA of $315 million and adjusted EPS of $1.39. Our third quarter revenues grew by 11% versus third quarter 2010, and our adjusted EBITDA rose 19% compared to the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 46% from 43%, and our adjusted EPS rose 48% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter run rate rose by 8% year-over-year to $876 million. Total sales remain at a healthy level. Despite choppy markets our retention rates remain strong, driving continued growth in our subscription run rate. The decline in the equity markets worldwide during the quarter did impact the growth of our asset based fee run rate especially on a sequential basis. Total sales were $38 million in the third quarter. New recurring subscription sales were $32 million, down 10% from a strong third quarter 2010 but up 4% from the second quarter of this year. Our sales in Asia, especially in Japan, remain strong. The U.S. market for us was stable and Europe was surprisingly steady despite the headlines. During the quarter our sales to asset owners were strong and banks and broker dealers were surprisingly resilient. Our sales to asset managers remain stable and our hedge fund sales remain weak. Our retention rate overall remains strong. The third quarter aggregate retention rate rose to 91% from 88% a year ago, as total cancellations declined more than 20%. Our year-to-date retention rate is up 3% to 92%. The fact that our retention rate is holding in the low 90s validates the importance and mission critical nature of our products to our client investment processes. As a result our net new recurring subscription sales rose 4% to $16 million during the quarter. The growth of net new subscription sales was offset by a $6 million decline in run rate resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter. As a reminder we adjust our run rate at the end of each quarter to reflect the current spot foreign exchange rates again at the end of the quarter. Including this adjustment in foreign exchange rates our total subscription run rate was $758 million, up 8% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Finally, we have continued to invest in our business. The number of MSCI employees has risen by about 8% since the end of 2010 with all of that growth coming in our emerging market centers. After a slow start for the year we have been more successful in adding employees over the second and third quarters, and that should position us very well for continued growth. Next let us take a closer look at the performance of our major product line. Our index and ESG business reported revenues of $101 million, up 20% from the third quarter 2010, and our run rate of $383 million up 13% year-over-year. Total index and ESG sales rose 6% year-over-year to $14 million. New recurring subscription sales were $10 million, down 5% from a strong third quarter of 2010. Higher sales of our benchmark index products were offset by a decline in sales of indexed financial products. Cancellations of the index and ESG business continued to decline, falling 27% year-over-year and pushing our retention rate to 95% from 92% in the third quarter of 2010. As a result, the index and ESG subscription run rate, which excludes asset based fees, rose 3% sequentially and 15% year-over-year to $265 million. Asset based revenues rose 39% year-over-year but fell sequentially as a result of the fall in global equity markets. The run rate at the end of the third quarter was up 9% year-over-year to $118 million but was down 16% from the end of June of this year. At the end of September there were $290 billion of assets in ETFs linked to our indices, down $70 billion or 20% compared to June 30, 2011. Virtually all of the decrease versus the second quarter was due to a fall in market values as declines in non-U.S. indices were magnified by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Asset outflows were negligible. Our average basis point fee, excluding minimums, fell slightly to 3.1 basis points at the end of the third quarter, driven by the outperformance of ETFs linked to our U.S. indices. We continue to see a lot of interest from asset managers in using our indices as the basis for new ETFs. 27 net new ETFs linked to our indices were launched in the third quarter brining our worldwide total on September 30th to 508 funds. As a reminder, on the second U.S. business day of each month we publish on MSCI.com the assets under management of ETFs linked to our indices for the prior month. Those numbers will be updated after the close of today’s market and they will be as follows. At the end of October there were $322 billion in assets under management linked to our indices, up 11% from the end of the third quarter. We continue to build our families of MSCI strategy indices. These are index series that are intended to compliment our core market capitalization weighted indices and they include minimum volatility indices, fundamentally value-weighted indices and risk-weighted indices. We have already won several institutional passive mandates on these indices and nine shares recently launched for ETFs linked to our minimum volatility indices. These are encouraging signs of growing market acceptances of these products. At the beginning of October we also launched the MSCI emerging market 50 index, which highlights the 50 largest constituents of the market leading MSCI emerging market index. The product is designed as a more easily tradable alternative to the broader index and we are seeing a strong early interest from broker dealers. Revenues for our risk management analytics business were $62 million, up 13% versus the third quarter of 2010. The risk management analytics run rate of $252 million grew by 1% sequentially and by 10% year-over-year. Changes in foreign exchange rates, especially the strengthening of the dollar against the euro during the quarter, reduced the risk management analytics run rate by $4 million or 2%. Total risk management analytic sales were $13 million in the quarter, down 27% year-over-year from a very strong third quarter of 2010 and up 24% sequentially. New recurring subscription sales were $12 million. The level of demand for risk systems remains healthy, although we did experience some slippage during the quarter of deals from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. One of the key areas of growth in our risk management analytics business is our sales to asset owners especially pension funds. We signed contracts with two of the top 20 U.S. pension funds during the quarter. To support this demand we released an updated version of BarraOne that incorporates the latest version of the Barra integrated model. This innovative model now includes coverage of private real estate portfolios as well as publicly traded fixed income, global equities, currencies and hedge funds and allows asset owners to have a more granular view of the risks and correlations across their entire investment programs. The new model also enables us to provide our asset manager clients more in-depth analysis in certain asset classes like fixed income and currency. Another key area of growth for us in the risk management analytics business is our hedge fund transparency product line. Hedge fund investors are eager to better understand the risk across their hedge fund holdings and our service provides aggregated position level risk analysis and reporting without disclosing the fund by fund position themselves. During the quarter we added 2 of the top 10 largest global fund of hedge funds to our client base. Cancellations in the risk management analytics business declined 29% and the third quarter retention rate improved from 88% to 92%. For the first nine months of 2011, the retention rate has increased to 93% from 88%. Our Portfolio Management Analytics business or PMA continue to recover. Revenues were $30 million. While run rate of this business declined 3% year-over-year, it rose 1% sequentially to $119 million. We had $4 million of new recurring subscription sales in our PMA business in the third quarter with the majority of that coming from sales of our risk models and our data. Our retention rate increased to 87% from 82% in the third quarter of 2010 as cancellations declined 29%. For the first nine months of 2011 our retention rate stands at 89%, up from 85% in 2010. As promised in this business we are delivering new products into the equity portfolio management and trading market. During the quarter we launched our innovative new U.S. equity model, the first in a series of models designed to deliver much better forecast of risk and expected returns for optimized portfolios. We also plan to launch an updated version of our global equity risk model in the near future. Additional single-country models using our newer framework will be launched and new functionality into the Barra portfolio management software platform is being worked on. The governance business continues to lay a foundation for future growth. Revenues were $29 million in the third quarter. Governance run rate slipped slightly versus the second quarter of 2010 to $107 million as currency changes offset our third consecutive quarter of positive net new subscription sales. Total governance sales rose 13% year-over-year to $7 million. New recurring subscription sales driven by strong sales of our new executive compensation product rose 62% to $4 million, which more than offset a decline in non-recurring sales for the segment. Cancellations rose 5% and the retention rate for the third quarter was 86%, down 1% from the third quarter of 2010. For the first nine months of the year the retention rate was 87%, up from 86% a year ago. To sum up, MSCI reported a strong operating and financial results during the third quarter of 2011 despite the impact of weaker financial markets all over the world. The combination of solid overall sales and continued strength in retention rate helped drive continued growth in our subscription run rate. Looking ahead, our pipeline is healthy and the ETF assets linked to our indices have rebounded from the lows of the third quarter. We believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of the strong long term secular trend that are in demand in our business worldwide. I’ll now turn it over to David for some additional comments regarding our third quarter financial results. David?
David Obstler: Thank you, Henry. Before we get started, I want to remind everyone that we closed the acquisition of RiskMetrics on June 1, 2010, the first day of MSCI’s 2010 fiscal third quarter. That means that all of the quarterly comparisons we are making represent the actual results of the company on a combined basis. MSCI reported revenues of $225 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $675 million for the first nine months of the year. MSCI’s third quarter revenue growth was driven by 20% growth in index and ESG product revenues and a 13% growth in risk management analytics revenues. These gains were offset by a 5% decline in governance revenues. By type of revenue, subscription revenues grew 7%, asset-based fees grew 39% and non-recurring revenues were essentially flat. By segment, performance and risk revenues grew by 14% year-over-year to a $196 million in the third quarter of 2011. Governance revenues, as I noted earlier, declined 5% to $29 million. As a result of a shift in strategy within the ISS corporate business we now have a greater percentage of sales, as Henry mentioned earlier, coming from recurring subscriptions rather than non-recurring sales, which is having a modestly negative impact on recorded revenues during the quarter prior period comparisons. Overall, adjusted EBITDA expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, non-recurring stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and transaction expenses rose 5% year-over-year to a $121 million. Our compensation costs rose by 5% also to $85 million. As Henry mentioned, we have been able to leverage our emerging market centers to mitigate the financial impact of our ongoing investments in our employee base. In the past 12 months we’ve grown our employee base by 10% including a 7% increase in the third quarter. The majority of this growth has come in emerging market centers like Budapest, Monterey, Mumbai and Manila where our headcount growth is over 40%. That has helped keep our overall compensation costs in check. We generated $104 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, an increase of 19% from the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 46% from 43% in the third quarter last year. On a segment basis performance and risk adjusted EBITDA grew 21% to $96 million and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 48.9% from 46.1% in the third quarter of last year. Governance adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat, but the margin expanded by 140 basis points to 26.5%. For the first nine months of 2011 we reported adjusted EBITDA of $315 million, an increase of 23% from the pro forma nine months of last year. MSCI’s adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 46.7% from 42.6%. Performance in risk adjusted EBITDA margin rose 24% to $290 million and governance adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $25 million. We incurred $12 million of other expenses in the third quarter, most of which was interest expense related to our debt. Our interest expense declined versus the third quarter of last year as we realized the benefit of lower levels of outstanding debt and lower interest costs resulting from the re-pricing of our debt during the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 29.2%. For the nine months of 2011, the tax rate was 33.3%. The third quarter 2011 tax rate benefited from the recognition of two non-recurring tax benefits totaling $4.2 million. Excluding those benefits, the third quarter tax rate would have been 35.1% and our year-to-date tax rate would have been 35.4%. We are currently projecting our full year tax rate to be approximately 34% to 34.5% including those two non-recurring items I just discussed, and that would imply a fourth quarter effective tax rate of approximately 37%. Third quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.40 per share, up from $0.08 per share in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the after tax per share impact of restructuring costs, non-recurring stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangibles, transaction expenses and debt repayment and financing costs, was $0.49 a share, up 48% from $0.33 per share in the third quarter of last year. For the first nine months of the year, MSCI’s GAAP-diluted EPS was $1.05 a share, up $0.55 from last year, and our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $1.39, up 36% from the nine months of last year. During the third quarter, MSCI generated $95 million of operating cash flow, up from $66 million from the third quarter of 2010. Our operating cash flow for the first nine months was $175 million, up from a $121 million last year. Capital expenditures were $10 million in the third quarter and $17 million over the first nine months of 2011. We ended the third quarter with $1.1 billion of total debt outstanding of which roughly 38% is swapped into fixed rate instruments. We also had $364 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments on our balance sheet. Finally, our quarterly weighted average fully diluted share cap was a 122 million shares, essentially flat from the second quarter of this year. With that we would be happy to take any questions you might have. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Suzie Stein of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Hi, good morning. I am just wondering if you could update us on any conversations you’ve had with ETF providers, particularly BlackRock in regard to your fee structure just given the tone of the market and given the recent filing by BlackRock to be an index provider.
Henry Fernandez: Yeah, Suzie, there is absolutely no change whatsoever on our fee structure with any index, EPS provider anywhere in the world. There are no discussions or conversations about changes to our fee structure of any nature with anybody. With respect to BlackRock we have a great relationship getting stronger and we’re trying to do more things together around the world. So, no change whatsoever there.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then what’s been the response for the new equity models released this quarter? Are clients paying for the upgrade or is this part of the subscription? And then, is there a higher price point for new clients?
Henry Fernandez: The response has been overwhelmingly positive. There are a lot of people who have been part of the beta-test of this model who have seen how robust the new model is with respect to forecasting expected returns on risk and portfolios in any market. Let me pass it on to David with respect to the fee structure.
David Obstler: Yeah. We are in upselling, selling through the model to clients and achieving success. It’s early days. We’re just out with it. But as Henry mentioned, the response from the clients is it’s been positive.
Henry Fernandez: The other thing that I would highlight is that this model was built with a lot of new modeling methodologies, and it’s the first of a long series of models that we will be launching that have this improvement. A few of those models, for example, will be launched before the end of the year, another one will be in the first quarter and in the balance of 2012.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore Partners. Your line is open.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: Thank you, and good morning.
Henry Fernandez: Good morning.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: Could you give us an update, David, on the current rate of RiskMetrics related cost savings in the September quarter and whether you see an opportunity to achieve additional cost savings in the next 12 months?
David Obstler: Yeah, thanks. We reported in the last quarter that we achieved our target, $50 million, and that that had run through the financial statements and closed the book on that chapter. As far as going forward we are making investments in the business, in the risk business, in a number of different areas, as well as continuing to work as we do every quarter on our cost structure in areas of non-compensation such as market data, IP, etcetera. Those numbers are flowing through the growth rates in our cost structure, which as we said is 5% in comp and non-comp in the quarter.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: I see. And then, Henry, you highlighted 27 net new ETFs that were linked to your indices in the quarter. Do you have a good sense of the pipeline of new ETFs that might link to your indices in the next 6 to 12 months?
Henry Fernandez: There’s not a great deal of change on the pipeline. Clearly this is a product line that has remained resilient worldwide regarding the flows of assets, net new so to speak or net flows of assets, compared to – like for example mutual funds. I think many ETF providers, even though cautious, continue to work hard at launching new products.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Riggs of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just give us an update on your plans for hiring in the coming quarters? It sounded like Q2, Q3 were big hiring quarters. And then a follow up on that would be, will there be more of a focus on kind of content development or sales or both?
Henry Fernandez: I think we will continue to hire new staff at a steady pace, especially staff in our emerging market centers. We believe very strongly that the secular wins for pretty much everything we do get even more reinforced and even more positive for us during periods of crisis like this, obviously from passive management to bridge management to quantitative tools to help in optimizing portfolios, to governance and so on and so forth. So therefore we are very keen on continuing to invest in our distribution channels. So, a lot of our people – a lot of the people that we’re hiring are in sales and client service and consultant and the like to work directly with clients. And we’re also very keen on continuing to invest and launch new products pretty much across the board. We’re launching new indices, we’re clearly launching a lot of new models and software in the Barra business. We’re investing also in the risk management business, in performance contribution and (inaudible) risk and liquidity risk, and as you saw non-private – as I said non-liquid assets for asset owners, and so on and so forth. And all of that is already baked into the cost structure of the company. So the additional headcount I think is not going to put an inordinate amount of pressure at all on our financials.
David Obstler: As we mentioned in the remarks, the net hiring is in the emerging markets and that has enabled us to add these heads but control the costs, the compensation costs related to that.
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company: Great, thank you.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Michael Weisberg of Crestwood Capital. Your line is open.
Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital: Hi, everyone. How are you?
Henry Fernandez: How are you doing Michael?
Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital: Good. Couple of things, could you – the index business, could you give us a sense of the run rate on a sequential basis constant currency? Is there a way of doing that?
Henry Fernandez: Well, there are customary numbers. Michael, the Index business is largely prized in dollars. The index subscription business, not the ETF, right, not the asset based fees, it's largely priced in dollars pretty much all over the world. There are very, very few exceptions to that. The businesses that are part of the run rate is in foreign currencies, for example, the risk management analyst business and the PMA, the Portfolio Management Analytics business, but the Index business is largely devoid of any sort of foreign exchange issues. Now, clearly, on the ETF part, the majority of the Indices that we have and the ETF linked to those Indices are non-dollar denominated Indices that get translated into dollars as listed in the U.S. for example.
David Obstler: Yeah. Just to follow up, Michael. The impact in the quarter on the run rate in the benchmark business was less than $400,000. As Henry mentioned, most of the contracts are denominated in dollars. Most of the run rate difference, which is a little under $6 million, was in the Risk Management Analytics business, where more of the contracts are in Euros et cetera. So, as far as the benchmark business is concerned, negligible effect on the run rate in the benchmark business from currencies.
Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital: Well, because I guess the follow-up would be, you were flat sequentially. Now you were flat sequentially last year as well in the second and third, is that because of a decline in non-subscription business? Because you would think based on the ACV that your revenues would be up sequentially? In the Index business, I’m sorry.
David Obstler: Yeah. The Index business was up 2.8% sequentially in the quarter on a run rate basis.
Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital: I’m talking about revenues. The revenues were flat.
David Obstler: The revenues would mainly be related to two things. One is the AUM, as we mentioned, where the average assets under management were lower, and there are small and recurring non-recurring sales, one-time sales in periods-to-periods that have that effect down into the single percentages or so.
Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital: Okay. Again, I was talking about flatness in the index business, not the ETF business. ETF I understand. I was talking about flatness in the Index business.
David Obstler: And that would most likely be related to the one-time sales and the timing of those sales with a one-time sale in one period versus the other.
Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital: I see. Okay.
David Obstler: The subscription business, the benchmark was up 2.8% sequentially in run rate. That is – to remind everybody that doesn’t include the non-recurring sale. So, this effect down into these percentages is related to whether you have a one-time sale in one quarter versus another.
Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital: I see. That’s affected that.
David Obstler: Yeah.
Michael Weisberg – Crestwood Capital: What kind of challenge do you see in the fourth quarter in the risk business? Just because I think traditionally a lot of the subscriptions come up for renewal fourth quarter. Should we expect a material jump in cancel rates in the fourth quarter?
Henry Fernandez: It’s hard to say, to forecast, Michael, right now. But, what we can say is that the secular demand for risk management analytics gets even stronger in environments like this. Our pipeline remains pretty healthy, but the RMA business is lumpy. For example, in this quarter, this third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010, it may look unfavorable because there were very strong sales, particularly to U.S. asset managers in the third quarter of 2010. Some of that would delay purchases that people delay because of the closing of the RiskMetrics acquisition. There was a little bit of uncertainty there from the second quarter and therefore they slipped into the third quarter. Overall we’re not worried per se about the level of fundamental demand for risk management analytics among our client base worldwide. As I said, this quarter, this third quarter, it was particularly strong with asset owners, pension funds in risk management. It remains weak on hedge funds. Part of that has been the way we’ve approach the market, and we’re making changes to that and re-pricing certain products to the lower end of the market so we can also participate there. Part of it is that many hedge funds have been very negative about the market outlook during the third quarter.
David Obstler: Yes, Michael. As you’ve been following, there is a weighting in the fourth quarter. It’s not our most weighted. The governance business is more weighted in terms of renewals, but there is a weighting. That would mean on the same retention rate you would have more cancels than you’ve seen in previous periods. But, the weighting is not very significant in the RMA business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Scharf of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
David Scharf – JMP Securities: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on risk as well. The new sales were I think stronger than certainly I was looking for. You mentioned in the press release strong growth particularly from BarraOne. I’m wondering, Henry, can you kind of bring us up-to-date on a year post the RiskMetrics acquisition? Just how BarraOne and RiskManager are sort of positioned side-by-side in the market. I mean I can recall when RiskMetrics was standalone and we would ask about BarraOne, and the response usually was they really didn’t cross paths in the sales cycle. Just trying to get a sense for how they’re positioned, what different types of customers perhaps they’re going after and whether there’s some integration down the road or cannibalization.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. Good question. We don’t see pretty much any cannibalization between these two product lines. They are positioned differently in the sense that BarraOne is ideally suited for what we call asset owners, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations and the like. RiskManager on the other hand, is ideally suited for hedge funds, multi-strategy, large multi-strategy hedge funds. So, the overlap in between is asset managers, and within asset managers RiskManager is more well-suited for wealth managers, and that’s been a very strong market for us, although from clearly low levels. Then asset managers, not only asset managers per se, there’s some that BarraOne would be better for them and there’s some that RiskManager would be better for them, and we end up looking at what is the best approach for them. RiskManager is also fairly well-suited for banks and broker dealers on the sales side, especially in the prime brokers operations. That’s an area that this quarter, when I mentioned in the beginning that banks and broker dealers were surprisingly resilient it’s on the heels of good sales of risk management analytics or officially RiskManager per se for that segment of the market. So, I think between these two product lines covering pretty much the wide spectrum of different client segments and various use cases worldwide, we feel that we are extremely well positioned, and with a strong secular demand for risk management analytics. The issue for us clearly is to deal with the lumpiness of these sales. One quarter will be great, the next one will be less great and the like, and to continue to make sure we invest in the product line to deliver the functionality and the services that clients are demanding.
David Scharf – JMP Securities: Okay. That’s a helpful distinction. Following that route of geography, I know RiskManager historically has gotten anywhere from 40% upwards of 50% of new sales from Europe. On the BarraOne side, this is a few quarters in a row where you’ve highlighted pension funds in particular, so I assume that, that’s BarraOne. Are those all U.S. based, from the asset owner standpoint and BarraOne in particular, is there a European pipeline of substance or is it primarily focused on domestic sales for the time being?
Henry Fernandez: Well, the pipeline is across the world, from BarraOne sales in Japan to Europe and the U.S. Obviously the U.S., especially the U.S. public pension fund market has been a pretty sweet spot for us. In the old days, corporate pension funds – you know, if you go back 20 years or so, corporate pension funds were the ones at the leading age of best practices and risk management and other areas. Today the public pension funds are the ones that are leading the charge. So, we have been very successful with public pension plans in the U.S. and around the world, and we’re now beginning to develop quite a good pipeline of corporate pension plans. In Europe we have a few new clients that are in the 401(k), the equivalent of the design contribution space, especially in the U.K. We’ve got some good clients in Scandinavia. As I said, some of the public and private – public and corporate pension plans in Japan, the one area that we are still struggling to penetrate is asset owners in Mainland China for example. We have two or three of the salient, big clients there. China Investment Corp for example is a client of BarraOne. We made a public announcement about that a few months ago. We have just returned from China last week. One of the things we’re trying to figure out is how to sell some of these systems in a market that is a little bit cautious about using on-line ASP solutions.
David Obstler: Also to add another aspect of the asset owner client base has been in our hedge fund transparency business where the fund-to-fund and other asset owners have been strong. That’s been in Europe as well as in United States. So that’s been a strength for us also in the asset owner area.
Henry Fernandez: That was as a result of the acquisition in July of 2010 of the Measurisk, a small company that we bought from JPMorgan. We merged it into a product called Hedge Platform that was part of RiskMetrics. It took us almost a year to re-engineer that combination and find alternative sources of data and the like. But now it’s beginning to go into high gear. That’s an area of meaningful growth for us in the next years to come.
David Scharf – JMP Securities: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back over for closing remarks.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Latoya and thank you everyone for joining us. Have a good day.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Executives: David Obstler - Chief Financial Officer Edings Thibault -  Henry Fernandez - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
Analysts: David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC Georgios Mihalos Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley Unknown Analyst -  Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company L.L.C.
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MSCI Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn the program over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.
Edings Thibault: Thank you, Harry. Good morning and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2011 earnings call. Please note that earlier this morning we issued a press release describing our results for the second quarter and first 6 months of 2011. A copy of that release can be viewed on our website at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab. This presentation may contain forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management's current estimates, projections, expectations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company, please see the description of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending November 30, 2010.  Today's earnings call may also include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exclude the following: Third-party transaction expenses resulting from the acquisition of RiskMetrics; restructuring costs related to the acquisition of RiskMetrics; and nonrecurring stock-based expense. Adjusted EPS also excludes the amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and debt repayment and refinancing expenses. Please refer to today's earnings release for the required reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other related disclosures.  Since we will be referring to run rate frequently on our discussion this morning, let me remind you that a run rate is an approximation at a given point in time of the forward-looking fees for subscriptions and product licenses that we will record over the next 12 months assuming no cancelations, new sales, changes in the assets and ETF licensed our indices or changes in foreign currency rates. Please refer to table 12 in our press release for a detailed explanation. Our chairman and CEO Henry Fernandez, will begin the discussion this morning with an overview of the second quarter. And then our Chief Financial Officer, David Obstler, will provide some details on our financial results. In the case of financial accounting metrics, the discussion will focus on pro forma results, which assume the acquisition of RiskMetrics occurred at the beginning of MSCI's 2010 fiscal year.  Pro forma second quarter 2010 results reflect the combination of MSCI's historical fiscal second quarter ending May 31, 2010, with RiskMetrics first quarter ending March 31, 2010. Pro forma 6 months 2010 includes MSCI's results for the 6 months ended May 31, 2010, and RiskMetrics fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, and first quarter ended March 31, 2010. All operating metrics as distinct from financial accounting metrics have been restated to reflect the company's results on a combined basis during the comparable period in 2010. That means all quarterly operating metrics reflect the calendar quarter or 6 months indicated rather than the prior fiscal period.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Henry Fernandez. Henry?
Henry Fernandez: Thank you, Edings. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning we reported second quarter revenues of $226 million, adjusted EBITDA of $107 million and adjusted EPS of $0.47. For the first 6 months of 2011, we reported revenues of $450 million, adjusted EBITDA of $211 million and adjusted EPS of $0.90. Our second quarter revenues grew by 12% versus second quarter 2010 and our adjusted EBITDA rose 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 47.2% from 42.3%. Our adjusted EPS rose 34% versus the second quarter of 2010.  From an operating perspective, MSCI benefited from solid overall sales and a continued and sustained improvement in retention rate. Our second quarter run rate grew by 17% versus second quarter 2010 and by 3% from the first quarter of 2011.  Our subscription run rate, which as you know excludes the impact of our fast-growing asset-based fee business, grew by 13% year-over-year and by 3% sequentially.  Total sales, which include recurring subscription sales as well as one-time sales, were $39 million in the second quarter, down 4% from last year. New recurring subscription sales were $30 million, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter of 2010.  Our retention rate remained very strong during the second quarter, rising in each of our 4 largest product lines.  MSCI's Aggregate Retention Rate rose to 92% from 89% in the second quarter of 2010 as cancellations fell by 18% year-over-year. The strength in retention rate speaks to the mission-critical nature of many of our products and is a testament to our efforts to invest in our client service organization.  I would like now to discuss the performance of each of our 4 major product lines in more detail. Index and ESG products. Our index and ESG business continued its strong performance in the second quarter of 2011, with reported revenues of $103 million, up 21% from second quarter 2010 and a run rate of $398 million, up 26% year-over-year. Total index and ESG sales rose 9% year-over-year to $18 million. Recurring subscription sales were $14 million, down slightly from the very strong levels that we experienced in the second quarter of 2010.  Cancellations continued to decline, falling 16% year-over-year and leading to an increase in our retention rate to 93% versus the 90% in the second quarter of 2010.  The combination of strong sales and modest cancels boost our subscription run rate, which excludes asset-based fees, up 4% sequentially and 16% year-over-year to a total of $257 million.  The growth in our index business in the first half of 2011 has been driven by strong demand for our core benchmark indices. While the strongest sales growth came from our emerging market indices, we also saw double-digit increases in sales of our developed market indices as well. Our clients also continued to expand their use of our indices and data within their organizations, which led in turn to strong growth in usage fees.  During the quarter, we continued to be successful in our strategy of promoting the use of our All Country World Index, or ACWI, as a policy benchmark for pension fund and older asset owners, launching several more ACWI wins during the quarter. As a reminder, ACWI is a broad index covering 45 countries comprised of 24 developed markets and 21 emerging markets.  During the second quarter, futures contracts based on the MSCI Emerging Markets and IFA Indices were migrated from the CME to the New York Stock Exchange Liffe platform. I am pleased to note that the transition of these 2 key contracts went very smoothly.  We also continued to broaden our investment in the environmental, social and government, or ESG business, with the launch of 25 new ESG indices. These new indices reflect the combination of MSCI's deep understanding of the investment process and expertise in building indices with the world-class ESG research acquired in the RiskMetrics combination. Our new products should enable more institutional investors to implement a growing range of ESG investment strategies across the board.  Our asset-based fee business of the index and ESG business remained a very strong engine of growth with second quarter revenues of $36 million and a run rate of $140 million. Most of the 48% year-over-year increase in our asset-based fee run rate resulted from the growth of assets under management in exchange credit funds linked to MSCI indices.  At the end of June, there were $361 billion of assets under management in EPS linked to our indices, up $124 billion or 52% compared to June 30, 2010.  The second quarter saw net inflows of $14 billion, offsetting a 1% decline in market value and marking the 13th consecutive quarter of positive inflows into EPS linked to MSCI indices. Net inflows to MSCI linked EPS rose 21% in the second quarter and are up 26% versus the first 6 months of 2010. That is a continued sign that the popularity of MSCI linked EPS continues to grow.  Finally, our average basis point fee, excluding minimums, remained 3.2 basis points at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter of this year. 47 new EPS linked to our indices were launched in the second quarter, bringing the worldwide total to 481 EPS.  As a reminder, on the second U.S. business day of each month, we publish on our website the assets under management of EPS linked to our indices for the prior month. Those numbers were updated on Tuesday night of this week. At the end of July, there were $360 billion in AUM linked to our indices, about the same at the end of the second quarter, despite the turmoil in the equity markets around the world.  Now on to our Risk Management Analytics business, or RMA. Revenues for RMA were $61 million, up 18% versus the second quarter of 2010. The RMA run rate of $249 million grew by 2% sequentially and by 24% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the Measurisk acquisition done last July or July of last year, our annual run rate growth was 18%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, especially the strengthening of the Euro against the dollar in the quarter, also contributed $1 million to the growth in run rate versus March of 2011.  Total RMA sales were $10 million in the second quarter, down 19% year-over-year. Recurring subscription sales were $9 million. As we have spoken about in the past in these calls, sales in the Risk Management Analytics business can be lumpy because of the impact that large dollar deals can have on the results of any given quarter.  In the second quarter, we had fewer such large deals than in recent periods, which had an impact on the quarterly sales figures. In addition, second quarter sales were impacted by 2 other factors: First, we were disappointed by the level of sales into hedged funds. These customers appear to have turned more cautious in recent months and less willing to take on big new spending initiatives. The second issue is that we saw several deals primarily with pension funds take longer to close than we had expected. This second factor is primarily a timing issue. Some of these deals have already closed in this current quarter, and we expect others to close during the current quarter and the fourth quarter of this year.  Cancellations in the RMA business increased year-over-year but remained at relatively low levels. The second quarter retention rate remained 92%. For the first 6 months of 2011, the retention rate has increased to 93% from 88% of the comparable period last year.  Our business in Portfolio Management Analytics, or PMA, grew slightly on a sequential basis. Revenues were $29 million, and run rate rose 1% sequentially to $118 million. That is the second consecutive quarter of sequential run rate growth and another step towards returning this business to an acceptable level of growth. We had $3 million of recurring subscription sales in our PMA business in the second quarter, with the majority of that coming from sales of our risk models and data.  Since the end of 2010, we have been relentlessly focused on protecting our existing client base from competitors, and those efforts have continued to pay off. Cancellations fell by almost half in the quarter and are down by 29% in the first half of this year. The Aggregate Retention Rate improved to 91% from 84% in the second quarter and to 90% from 87% in the first half.  We are continuing to invest in the PMA business. In fact, we will be launching a new flagship U.S. equity market model on Tuesday of next week. This is the first of several new risk models we will be launching over the second half of 2011, and they incorporate cutting-edge analytical innovations that should cement Barra's status as a provider of high-quality and innovative quantitative risk models. We are excited to get these models into our clients' hands. We also remain on track to deliver major new functionality in our Barra Portfolio Manager platform later on this year to continue sales of that product.  Finally, we are seeing some evidence that quantitative funds are beginning to outperform the overall market and some of our clients have made positive comments about the potential for a return to positive fund flows to this product class over the next 6 to 12 months. If that optimism by our quantitative clients is well played, it will be a welcome change in the overall operating environment for our PMA business.  The Governance business also improved sequentially. Revenues were $31 million in the second quarter and our run rate expanded sequentially to $108 million driven by a combination of solid sales and a decline in cancellations.  One of our major goals in the Governance business is to protect our existing client base and aggressively go after new clients. This strategy has began to bear fruit. Total Governance sales rose 18% to $7 million. Recurring subscription sales rose 17% to $4 million on the back of a strong gains in sales of our Proxy Distribution business in Europe. Cancellations declined 36% and the Aggregate Retention Rate for the second quarter increased to 90% from 86%. The Governance retention rate for the first half of the year increased to 88% from 85%.  To sum up, MSCI reported a strong operating and financial results during the second fiscal quarter of 2011. Our combination of solid overall sales and an increase in retention rate across our major product lines drove strong growth in our run rate. Demand for our Index products was the biggest driver of growth. Our Risk Management Analytics business continues to grow but sales were softer than expected. Our Portfolio Management Analytics and Governance businesses continued to stabilize and their sequential growth in run rate is encouraging.  Let me now turn it over to David for some additional comments regarding our second quarter financial results.
David Obstler: Thanks, Henry. MSCI reported revenues of $226 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $450 million for the first 6 months of the year. Second quarter growth was driven by organic growth of $17 million or 14% growth and the acquisitions of RiskMetrics and Measurisk, which added an additional $84 million.  Compared to pro forma second quarter 2010, operating revenues grew by 12%. MSCI's revenue growths were driven by a 21% growth in index and ESG product revenues and an 18% growth in Risk Management Analytics revenues. These gains were offset by a 4% decline in Portfolio Management Analytics revenues and a 4% decline in Governance revenues.  Also on a pro forma basis, subscription revenues grew by 10%. Asset-based fee revenues grew by 41% and nonrecurring revenues declined by 27%.  On a pro forma basis, the Performance and Risk segment revenues grew by 15% year-over-year to $196 million in the second quarter. Governance revenues declined as I mentioned by 4% to $31 million.  Overall, total pro forma adjusted EBITDA expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, nonrecurring stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and transaction expenses, rose by 2% year-over-year to $119 million. Pro forma compensation expenses, excluding nonrecurring stock-based comp, rose by 1% and non- compensation expenses rose by 5%.  We generated $107 million of adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of this year, a pro forma increase of 25% from the second quarter of last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 47.2% from 42.3% in the second quarter of last year.  On a pro forma segment basis, the Performance and Risk segment adjusted EBITDA grew by 29% to $100 million and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 50.9% from 45.6% in the second quarter of last year.  Governance adjusted EBITDA declined 8% to $7 million and the margins fell to 24% from 25% in the same period last year. The sequential decline in our Governance margin was partially driven by a seasonally higher temporary labor costs necessary to process the volume of proxies in that quarter in the U.S. peak proxy season.  For the first 6 months of 2011, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $211 million, an increase of 24% from the pro forma first 6 months of last year. MSCI's adjusted EBITDA margin in that period rose to 47% from 42.5% last year. Performance and risk adjusted EBITDA rose 27% to $195 million and Governance adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $17 million.  We incurred $13 million of other expense in the second quarter, most of which was interest expense related to our debt. Our interest expense declined sequentially as we realized the benefit of the reduction of interest costs resulting from the repricing and repayment of a portion of our debt during the first quarter.  Lower overall debt balances also shrank our interest costs versus the first quarter of 2011.  Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.4% down from 36.6% in the year ago period. The tax rate benefited from several discrete items. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 35.6%. Based on the actions taken to-date, we anticipate our full-year 2011 tax rate to be approximately 36%.  GAAP diluted earnings per share for the period, for the second quarter, was $0.37 a share. Our adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes after-tax per share impact of restructuring costs, nonrecurring stock-based comp, amortization of intangibles, transaction expenses and debt repayment and refinancing costs was $0.47 a share, up 34% from $0.35 a share in the second quarter of last year. For the first 6 months, MSCI's GAAP diluted EPS was $0.64 a share. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.90 a share, up 36% from the comparable period.  During the second quarter, MSCI generated $106 million of operating cash flow, up from $70 million in the second quarter of last year. Our operating cash flow for the first 6 months was $80 million, up from $55 million a year ago.  Capital expenditures were $3 million in the second quarter and $7 million over the first 6 months of 2011.  We ended the second quarter with $1.12 billion of total debt outstanding, of which roughly $420 million was swapped into fixed rate instruments. We also had $287 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on our balance sheet.  Finally, our weighted average fully diluted share count was 122 million shares, up only slightly from the first quarter of this year.  With that, we would be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in our queue is Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Your retention rate in the Portfolio Analytics segment was very good this quarter. Can you talk about what's driving this and does this give you confidence heading into the second half of the year that you won't see a drop-off like you did in Q4 last year?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. I think this is a business, Suzi, that is clearly stabilizing. We feel good where we are in that stabilizing cycle from declines of run rate and relatively higher cancels last year to a progression of return to growth and good retention rates. A lot of our efforts have been in blocking and tackling. I mean, we have put a lot of emphasis on those customers that are renewing in every quarter. We put a team together to make sure that the customers are using the product, that they're happy with what we're doing with them. We've been focused also as well in ensuring that if the customer's suffering from various issues or whatever, that we're flexible in our terms and conditions of our contract. With many customers we have actually increased the length of the contract from 1 to 2 or 3 years in order to create more stability with them. All of that is clearly reflected in the renewal rate and the like. So we feel pretty good about the retention and, therefore, we continue to be focused on that. But even more importantly, we are now focused on new sales, both with existing products and importantly the significant number of new products that we're going to be bringing to market in the next 12 to 18 months.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: So just to be clear, are you cutting prices and lengthening contracts? Is that what I heard you say or did I misunderstand you?
Henry Fernandez: No. I think that what we're doing is making sure that we maintain market share or increase market share in the business. And the way we do that is by a combination of factors, which is more service. We sometimes provide other products with the existing pay that they gave us. And in certain circumstances, we have declined -- we have decreased certain prices for people when the value proposition in a particular customer is not as we'd like it to be. But that's something we have been doing. This is not news at all. It is simply a continuation of what we've been doing for the last 3 years. So there's no new information. There's no new policies or anything like that in that approach.
David Obstler: And Suzi, to remind you, the retention rates are dollar retention rates. So all changes to contracts are included in that metric, which as you said was strong.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And you talked about the weakness in new sales. Can you talk about how much you think is related to timing versus how much is related to budget tightening?
Henry Fernandez: In the RMA -- you're talking about the RMA business?
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Yes.
Henry Fernandez: Yes. In the risks business, as we say, the sales were softer than we had expected in the quarter. Pretty much all client segments were as expected with the difference being 2 of them, which is the Hedge Fund segment and the Pension Fund segment. On the Pension Fund segment, it's purely a timing issue. We have fairly healthy pipelines of pension funds wanting to put in a risk management system. And that's a market that we're fairly bullish about over the years and the future. In the Hedge Funds segment, there was a slowdown there. I think that there have been less launches of new hedge funds that have had the ability to spend money on high-end risk systems like the ones that we have. A lot of the flows of funds in that area have gone through existing large hedge funds that may already have a system from us. So what we're focused on is defining strategies to up-selling those larger customers and then figuring out other strategies to penetrate further the small and medium-sized hedge funds that may be needing assistance. I think on a mixed basis, clearly, the expected sales to hedge funds, that did not materialize, were clearly larger than the timing issues associated with the Pension Funds.
Operator: Our next questioner on our queue is from George Mihalos with Bank of America.
Georgios Mihalos: I just wanted to delve in a little bit more on the RiskManager sales as well. If we look at the total pipeline of your business, has that declined from Q1 levels? And also can you maybe just talk a little bit about the environment, U.S. versus Europe, what you're seeing there?
Henry Fernandez: I think that the pipeline remains healthy pretty much across the board, as I said, with the exception of a weaker or softer pipeline in the Hedge Fund segment, which is not the majority of what we do but it impacts sales. The dialogue that we have with customers for Risk Management Analytics is very healthy, they're very strong. We also have quite a lot of trials going on and the likes of -- I think what -- that's one element, George. The second element is that there are -- the sales of this product line which are very different in this respect from other product lines have, at times, $1 million-plus sales from 0. I mean we clearly have renewals of contract in the Index business that are large, $1 million, $2 million, $3 million. But the net new is, at times, a few hundred thousand dollars as opposed to one lump $1 million or $1.5 million or $2 million. So therefore, when 1 or 2 or 3 of those million dollar sales hit the Risk Management Analytics business, it makes it a strong quarter. When you don't have that, it doesn't make it a strong quarter. We definitely have those kinds of million-plus deals in the pipeline, and it's just a question of when they close and all that. I think that overall certain client segments, it looks like hedge funds and maybe some of the banks, we haven't experienced that yet. But maybe people are more cautious given the operating environment that is going on. I think on a relative basis, the U.S. asset managers have been stronger than the European asset managers. I think hedge funds have been soft across the board, U.S. and Europe for sure. And on pension funds, we've been clearly more successful in selling pension funds in the United States, particularly, public pension funds, but we also have a good healthy pipeline of pension funds in Asia and in Europe.
Georgios Mihalos: Okay. Great. And just the overall sales environment outside of the RiskManager business, given the difficulties we've see in the market as of late, has the tone of your conversations with clients and potential clients changed at all in some of those other businesses, or is it sort of business as usual in your end?
Henry Fernandez: I think except for those segments that I mentioned in Risk Management, I think the overall tone is healthy. The overall tone is good. At the very [ph] margin, you see that people are slowing a bit, some of them deficient. So it is not a change in whether they want to do the product or not. It just takes maybe one more approval, the cycle may be a little longer and the like. So we have not seen any major or wholesale change in mood in our clients, given the events in Europe, in the U.S. and, let's say, in China. But we're monitoring that very closely because I think some of those events are pretty recent.
Operator: Our next questioner in our queue is David Scharf with JMP Securities.
David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC: I'd like to follow up on the last question and response because quite possibly we are in a transitioning environment, it remains to be seen. But you've seen obviously a little bit of a pullback and lengthening of sales cycles potentially. When you think back to the I guess early, maybe late '08, early '09 period, kind of the onset of sort of the last downturn in the Investment Management sector, were there any leading indicators, kind of looking back on that period, that we should be focused on as we think about some of the moving pieces in this quarter and in the pipeline?
Henry Fernandez: It's really hard. I mean it's hard to say. I think for one -- one indicator that I follow closely is in order to understand risk and the environment is the exchange through the fund business. And what you have seen in the EPS that are linked to MSCI indices is that week after week, you continue to see inflows into this EPS, even the risky ones, like in emerging markets and the like. And obviously they are partially or fully offset by declines in the market. If anything, from last quarter to now, the percentage of EPS that we have linked to emerging market indices versus developed market indices has increased by a tad, not by a lot, but maybe 1 or 2 percentage points in this play. So that continues to bode well, which means people are equitized. People are still invested in risky asset classes, like emerging markets and people continue to put new money into these products even though they're being offset by declines in the marketplace. So that's something that gives us some assurances. Secondly, on the overall Index business, we have very, very strong sales. Some of them abnormal in the second quarter 2010 in the Index business. So when you compare this quarter to that quarter last year, it's not a fair comparison but you see a very solid, strong sale of indices into the marketplace. But things are a little tighter. Customers are not yet -- we have not heard people saying we're reevaluating our budget. We're deciding to postpose decisions or we're deciding to cancel what we're asking you to do. We have not yet seen any of that. What you are seeing is simply people are distracted because, obviously, they're following events. People are taking a little longer to make decisions, a little more approvals here and there and the like. I would not blow too much out of proportion what's happening to us in the hedge funds. Some of that was self-inflicted because we had a lot of deliveries of systems that we had sold last year. And therefore a lot of our sales people were focused on that rather than selling. Secondly, we were not as focused in the mid hedge fund space with our sales people. And therefore we didn't optimize sales into that and the like. But the sales were weaker. No question about it. But it's hard to say completely, how much is the environment and how much was things that we didn't do totally correctly on our side. We clearly -- maybe entering new territories here with what's happening in the market yesterday and today and in Europe and in the U.S. But that is clearly very recent. So far we have not seen major significant changes in tone or in mood by our clients. We've just seen tightening of the margins, which obviously has had some effect on our sales.
David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC: Right and understandable. Lastly, can you just remind me the percentage of Index revenue that comes from usage fees that's actually tied to headcount? It's not a big number, is it?
Henry Fernandez: The total run rate is, I think, 9%, 10%. It's not a big number. [Indiscernible] but the margin, it goes up by 10%. And this 10% on the total, that's 1% more sales, right?
David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC: All right. So that's 9%, 10% of index run rate is usage fees?
Henry Fernandez: Yes, that's my guess. We can get back to you with that number.
David Scharf - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. So headcount, it obviously a little bit client based. It is not a material driver.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question on our queue is Michael Weisberg [ph] with Crestwood Capital.
Unknown Analyst - : Henry, maybe I missed it. Did you have a run rate number just for the Equity Index business, not combining it with the index funds? Did you show that number? I didn't see it.
David Obstler: The subscription portion of the Equity Index?
Unknown Analyst - : Yes, the run rate, I mean, it was $247.8 million in the March quarter.
David Obstler: It's $257.5 million, up 16.4%.
Unknown Analyst - : Great. Could you maybe talk about the integration of sales forces and how far along are you in trying to sell the existing risk space product and the new product and how each side is doing and how the sales force transformation...
Henry Fernandez: Yes. Michael, we are pretty much done with the integration of RiskMetrics, the risk part of RiskMetrics and the risk part of MSCI. We're pretty much done with respect to the integration of the, sort of the administrative functions. We continue to now work on how do we grow from here in terms of better tools for the sales people, and in salesforce.com, for example, better financial analysis and planning in each one of the businesses that we're in. Those were not things that were part of the design or the plan or the integration of the 2 businesses. With respect to synergies, we're also largely done there. And if you notice that we didn't report that because we actually don't. We're not tracking them specifically anymore. We achieved what we said we would achieve. We're just moving forward now.
David Obstler: The integration of the sales forces, that we talked about, happened a year ago. And so the sales force is across geographies and in markets selling both products and has been for the last year.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is from Roberts Riggs with William Blair.
Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: You mentioned some of the new product launches coming in the Portfolio Analytics business. Looking across your business lines, any other gaps or new opportunities that you see where you'd look to add products through acquisition or internal investments?
Henry Fernandez: Yes. Our investment plans continue the impact [ph]. And you'll notice that in the quarter, I think we added 84 new people. Clearly our percentage of emerging markets continues to rise. So many of those people -- not all of them but many of them were added in emerging markets. On the PMA business, we are very much focused on strengthening and enhancing the sort of the library of risk models that we have across the board. We're working on 1 of 2 new models. But most of the effort is in launching the new generation of models with enhanced methodology, but in the existing market that we cover. And we're very much focused on creating a complete new software platform in Barra Portfolio Manager that has a huge amount of functionality to replicate the functionality that is in Aegis. I think that once we go beyond this in the next 12 months, we are already starting to plan for the development of a lot of new products, particularly models, in the portfolio management analytics space from statistical models and other models of that type, so that we can cover new markets, new scales and the like. So we feel pretty good about the Portfolio Management Analytics business and the turnaround that we make to that, and the very aggressive position that we got in the marketplace, the relentless focus on client retention and new sales, tightening up the internal organizational structure and a great team of people in research and software engineering delivering on a lot of new products. We don't see acquisitions there in the horizon. Most of our focus right now is organic growth. Even though the world economy and the world financial market is suffering dramatically from growth, for us, some of that is a little bit cyclical. The secular trend in our business are pretty powerful and, therefore, we're very focused on ensuring that we continue to invest in creating new products and the like in order to capitalize on those secular trends.
Operator: And at this time, I show no additional questioners in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fernandez for any closing comments.
Henry Fernandez: Well, yes. Thank you very much for participating especially on a day like today. It's not easy, given the events out there in the marketplace, we feel pretty strongly that your company here continues to deliver on our marketplace and our promise and we'll talk to you on the ensuing days.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. Attendees, you may disconnect at this time.
