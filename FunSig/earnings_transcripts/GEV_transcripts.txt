===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-23 07:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to GE Vernova's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appear delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Michael Lapides, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Michael Lapides: Thank you. Welcome to GE Vernova's First Quarter 2025 earnings call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Scott Strazik, and CFO, Ken Parks. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's Form 10-Q, press release, and presentation slides, all of which are available on our website. Please note that year-over-year commentary or variances on orders, revenue, adjusted and segment EBITDA, and margin, discussed during our prepared remarks are on an organic basis unless otherwise specified. We will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we do not undertake any obligation to do so. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Our fifth as a standalone public company. To start, I have to share with you that I am as confident and optimistic today as any day since our spin that we are creating a stronger company at GE Vernova, one that will drive substantial value ahead. We start with the markets. We continue to see very strong end markets and power electrification. Put simply, the world is entering an era of accelerated electrification. Driven by manufacturing growth, industrial electrification, EVs, emerging data center needs, which is driving an unprecedented need for investment in reliable base load power, grid infrastructure, and decarbonization solutions. As supply chains become more decoupled, with more redundancy built into the global system to manage trade complexities, this manufacturing build-out creates incremental demand for additional electrons. To put today's investment super cycle into perspective, the scale of load growth we're seeing in North America is the most significant since the post-World War II industrial build-out. But unlike then, the growth is global. The most populous country in the world, India, nearly 1.5 billion people, drives 80% of its electricity from coal. Saudi Arabia, which relies on heavy oil for nearly half of its power, has committed to a 50/50 mix of gas and renewables by 2030. These are just a few examples of the opportunities ahead as we help customers deliver more reliable and affordable power to the markets they serve. So all of this demand is driving growth, not only for new equipment but also for services as increased utilization of our installed base creates opportunities for additional service revenues, including upgrades. Services represent over 60% of our backlog, at strong margins, and provide significant revenue and cash flow visibility for years to come. While our end markets remain strong, we are not immune to the complexity at play given the current outline of tariffs and resulting inflation. We do expect our cost to go up $300 to $400 million in 2025. We are moving at pace to mitigate these pressures with pricing actions, including use of existing contractual provisions and the acceleration of our G&A cost structure transformation. We continue to invest in our supply chain to strengthen the durability and resiliency of our operations. For example, in January, we announced our plans to invest $600 million and add 1,500 new jobs in US manufacturing as part of our $9 billion global commitment to R&D and CapEx cumulatively through 2028. We remain confident in our financial trajectory from here and are reaffirming our 2025 financial guidance inclusive of the $300 to $400 million of tariffs and resulting inflation that we estimate as of today, net of our mitigating actions. In this dynamic environment, we will continue to act with urgency on further mitigation steps. This is an opportunity for GE Vernova to differentiate itself as a great industrial company. Overall, we have a solid balance sheet with an $8 billion cash balance, growing free cash flow, and expanding backlog, which positions us to invest both in our business and in shareholder accretive actions. For example, in the first quarter, we sold an incremental 2% in our China XD investment and completed our acquisition of Woodward's gas turbine parts business to further vertically integrate our gas power supply chain. As we begin our second year as a public company, we are well positioned to meet the growing demand with disciplined execution. Turning to the next slide on our first quarter results. We continue to build a stronger backlog supporting a long-term growth potential in our businesses. On a sequential basis, our equipment backlog grew $2.4 billion in Q1, and our services backlog grew $2 billion. We now maintain a total backlog of $123 billion. Specifically, in gas power, we grew equipment orders over 30% by booking 7 gigawatts of gas turbine orders. Additionally, we secured 7 gigawatts of new slot reservation agreements. In total, our gas turbine backlog has increased to 29 gigawatts, and we also have 21 gigawatts of slot reservation agreements that are expected to convert to orders and are not yet in backlog. All of these numbers in gigawatts align with McCoy reporting, which may differ from how our customers often announce projects as they cite the total combined cycle output of the plant, including the power from steam turbines. Considering the focus on gas power demand, I wanted to provide some incremental context on where we are seeing the orders trend for the year. We currently have 50 gigawatts of gas turbines under contract or with a slot reservation. We expect to ship over 10 gigawatts of equipment in the remainder of the year and add contracts for more than two times that amount to end the year with over 60 gigawatts between backlog and reservation agreements. The second half of the year should see a heavier mix of combined cycle orders after a first half with more simple cycle or peaking applications, driving the dollar value of orders in the second half of the year to be substantially higher than the first half. Sitting here today, 2026 and 2027 are largely sold out. We are approaching filling out 2028 and starting to sign agreements for later years. To give that context, I continue to see this market normalize to a higher for longer gas market. The world needs more dispatchable power generation to support economic growth and national security. Gas power will provide a significant amount of the incremental dispatchable power while also being the force multiplier for more renewables where wind and solar resources make sense. With this strength, commercial activity is accelerating for 2029 and 2030 deliveries. We remain focused on our fulfillment strategy of reaching 20 gigawatts of annualized deliveries in the second half of 2026 and sustaining 20 gigawatts per year starting in 2027. We are getting momentum in nuclear as well. Our customer in Ontario Power Generation received the license to construct the first SMR in North America earlier this month. We are also seeing increased interest in the US about expansions at existing nuclear sites as well as the development of SMRs with productive discussions with utilities, hyperscalers, and the administration on what it takes to commission our first SMR in the US by late 2030. And the growth is not restricted to power. We continue to grow our equipment backlog in electrification systems with $2 billion of sequential backlog growth, up 10% versus year-end levels, on the strength of demand for transformers and switchgear. Electrification remains our fastest-growing business, and orders remain strong, particularly in North America and Asia, which were our strongest growth regions this quarter. I mentioned services earlier, and I'll go into more detail here on what we saw this quarter. Customers continue to invest more in the installed base, driving orders in high-margin services. Services orders grew 16% as customers aim to get more capacity and better performance out of their plants. Gas power and onshore wind drove double-digit services order strength, and steam services orders were up nearly 60% this quarter as our customers are increasingly investing in equipment upgrades, including at existing nuclear sites, to extend the life of their plants and get more capacity. To provide a bit more context on wind in the quarter, we were pleased with delivering our fifth straight profitable quarter in onshore wind. We are also pleased with our progress with our utilization of robotic crawlers to inspect the inside of our blades both at the factory and at the site before we commission the turbine. We are investing over $100 million more year over year in 2025 to improve the performance of our installed base and remain confident these investments will yield a substantial improvement in fleet availability and services profitability in 2026. In offshore, we continue to make progress executing our existing backlog in the first quarter, commissioning another 17 units across Dogger Bank and Vineyard Wind. We still expect to be materially complete with Vineyard Wind in 2025 and to be mostly complete with Dogger Bank in 2026. We also agreed to a termination of the last remaining offshore wind supply agreement associated with the 18-megawatt product we are no longer developing. Our only remaining contractual commitments are the two projects currently in execution. Our losses in offshore wind have improved sequentially, and absent this one-time charge, we are better year over year as well. From a margin perspective, Power expanded margin 70 basis points, while electrification expanded margin almost 700 basis points. Wind expanded margin 190 basis points while continuing to control what they can control, given this is the one end market we continue to see real softness in today. We continue to expect margin expansion across all three segments in 2025. Lean remains core to how we operate as we maintain an intense focus on improving safety, quality, delivery, and cost, a focus we are embedding throughout GE Vernova that will benefit all stakeholders. Mid-February, we held our CEO Kaizen week, with over 120 Kaizens across 13 countries, across the segment, and corporate functions. Overall, we identified over 500 safety improvements in total during Kaizen week. We also identified enhancements to either capacity or delivery times that will create roughly $150 million in incremental revenues. Kaizens like these drive tangible, sustainable improvements across SQDC while also benefiting both our customers, employees, and our financial performance. In Q1, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow after spending over $400 million between R&D and CapEx combined, an improvement of $1.6 billion year over year given working capital benefits and higher EBITDA as we continue to run our businesses better. We are also creating value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we returned $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders and continued in April for a total of $1.5 billion of capital returned so far this year. Overall, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares at an average share price of $299. We shared our investor update in December that we would be opportunistic with our share buyback program. And today, we see a more valuable company with even greater prospects ahead. Taking into account the dynamic supply chain environment, matched with the strength in our businesses, as I discussed on the previous page, we are reaffirming our 2025 expectations to continue to grow backlog, expand margins, and deliver positive free cash flow throughout the year. With that, I'm gonna hand it over to Ken to provide details on Q1 results.
Ken Parks: Turning to slide five, we delivered a strong start to 2025 with continued orders and revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Importantly, we improved free cash flow by $1.6 billion year over year, reflecting strong down payments and working capital management, including further improvement in linearity. Demand remained robust in the first quarter as we booked $10.2 billion of orders, an increase of 8% year over year and approximately 1.3 times revenue. Services orders grew double digits with growth in each segment. Equipment orders grew low single digits, primarily driven by strength in power, partially offset by lower orders in onshore wind, as expected, and a tough comparison in electrification due to a large HVDC order recorded in the first quarter of last year. As a result of the strong orders, our backlog reached $123 billion, with equipment and services reaching $123 billion. Equipment margin and backlog remain healthy, reflecting higher price, as well as our focus on disciplined profitable growth. Revenue increased 15% with higher equipment and services revenues in all three segments. Equipment revenue grew 22% with double-digit growth in onshore wind, power, and electrification, while services revenue increased 8%. In addition, price was positive in each segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 70% to $1.7 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points. Margin improved in all three segments, driven by more volume, price, and productivity, which more than offset investments as well as inflationary impacts. We generated positive free cash flow in the first quarter of approximately $1 billion, a significant first-quarter milestone for GE Vernova. Free cash flow improved $1.6 billion year over year, reflecting higher down payments from rising orders and slot reservation agreements at Power, along with ongoing actions we're taking to improve linearity. Working capital in the quarter was a $1 billion cash benefit, which more than offset CapEx investments to support capacity expansion along with higher cash taxes on growing EBITDA. We're using Lean to drive better cash management and linearity. For example, the power team continues to focus on accelerating the cash conversion cycle. By implementing stronger daily management and new standard work, the team improved the timely payment of invoices. These actions decreased the power past dues balance by nearly 30% and reduced days sales outstanding by three days, resulting in approximately $150 million of additional free cash flow in the quarter. We continue to leverage our lean culture across GE Vernova to deliver consistently better financial results. In 1Q 2025, we generated approximately $100 million of incremental pretax proceeds by selling an additional partial ownership stake in our China XD grid business. The proceeds are classified outside of free cash flow, and the gain was removed from adjusted EBITDA. We continue to own just over 10% of China XD. Our strengthened free cash flow profile enabled us to repurchase $1.2 billion of stock and pay our inaugural dividend in the quarter. We ended 1Q 2025 with a healthy cash balance of $8.1 billion, which gives us confidence in navigating this dynamic environment. As Scott mentioned, we have continued share repurchases this month, completing approximately $300 million in April. Importantly, we remain committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade balance sheet. In March, Fitch revised its GE Vernova ratings outlook to positive from stable and affirmed our investment-grade credit rating of BBB. Our growing backlog with expanding backlog margin provides an excellent foundation for further improvements in our financial performance moving forward. Turning to Power on Slide six, the segment delivered another strong quarter with continued robust orders growth, increased revenue, and further EBITDA margin expansion. Power orders grew 28%, led by equipment at gas power and services strength. In Gas Power, equipment orders increased more than 30% as we booked 29 heavy-duty gas turbines, including eight units. This was almost double the number of heavy-duty units booked in 1Q of 2024. Power services orders were strong, increasing 18%, primarily driven by gas and steam. Revenue increased 16%, led by gas power. Equipment revenue growth was driven by increased deliveries. Services increased mainly from higher volume as well as price. EBITDA margins expanded 70 basis points to 11.5% as productivity, price, and volume more than offset the impact of inflation and additional expenses to support R&D and capacity investments at nuclear and gas power, respectively. Looking at the second quarter of 2025 at Power, we expect continued year-over-year growth in gas equipment orders. We also anticipate mid-single-digit organic revenue growth given expected equipment strength, as well as continued services growth. On a reported basis, we expect a low single-digit increase reflecting the impact of the divestiture of a portion of the steam business in the second quarter of 2024. We expect EBITDA margin of approximately 14% to 16% as productivity and price should more than offset inflation as well as additional expenses to support R&D and capacity investments at nuclear and gas power. Based on the current outline of tariffs and resulting inflation, we do not expect a material impact to our second-quarter financials at power or electrification. Turning to wind on slide seven. EBITDA margin improved even as we are investing more to enhance onshore fleet performance. Wind orders decreased 43%, driven by lower onshore wind equipment as a result of ongoing US policy uncertainty and permitting delays. In offshore, we remain focused on executing our existing challenged backlog. Wind revenue increased 15% in the quarter on higher onshore equipment deliveries and price, partially offset by lower offshore revenue as we executed on the updated delivery schedule. EBITDA losses improved 7%, driven by more profitable onshore equipment volume. Services costs increased in 1Q as we're deploying more crews and cranes to accelerate improvement in the onshore installed fleet performance. At offshore, EBITDA losses included a one-time termination of a supply agreement of approximately $70 million. As we've discussed, we remain cautious on the timing of an onshore order in North America as customers continue to navigate growing interconnection queues, policy uncertainty, and higher interest rates. We expect the wind segment to grow revenue high single digits in 2Q 2025, driven by higher onshore equipment deliveries. EBITDA losses should remain relatively consistent with 1Q 2025 as the impact of higher year-over-year onshore volume is offset by higher services costs to further improve the operating performance of the installed onshore fleet and the estimated impact of tariffs primarily at offshore. Turning to electrification on slide eight. Had another quarter of robust demand, significant revenue growth, and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders remain strong at approximately $3.4 billion, roughly 1.8 times revenue, driven by the growing need for grid equipment. While we saw substantial orders growth for switchgear and transformers in North America and Asia, total orders decreased low single digits year over year due to a large HVDC order recorded in the first quarter of 2024. Equipment orders outpaced revenue, further expanding the equipment backlog to approximately $22 billion, up more than $7 billion compared to the first quarter of 2024. Revenue increased 18%, driven by higher volume and price, particularly at grid solutions where we saw meaningful growth in switchgear and transformer equipment volumes. The segment delivered another quarter of double-digit EBITDA margins with 680 basis points of margin expansion on more profitable volume, increased productivity, and favorable pricing. In the second quarter of 2025, we anticipate continued solid equipment orders at healthy margins. Electrification revenue growth should be in line with our full-year guidance, driven by higher volume and favorable pricing, primarily at grid solutions, as we expect modest EBITDA margin expansion sequentially. I'll now turn to slide nine to discuss GE Vernova guidance further. For the second quarter, based on our expectations for the segment, which I've already outlined, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. While we expect to generate positive free cash flow in the second quarter, driven by our continuing focus on better cash linearity and increased EBITDA, we do anticipate lower free cash flow year over year due to the approximately $300 million nonrecurring arbitration refund received in the second quarter of 2024. We continue to expect to deliver positive free cash flow in all four quarters this year. For the full year, we're reaffirming the 2025 guidance, which includes the impact of tariffs as currently outlined and resulting inflation, which is estimated to be approximately $300 to $400 million net of mitigating actions. As Scott mentioned, we're actively navigating the dynamic environment and taking action. Some of our G&A cost-out acceleration and supply chain actions will occur in 2025, but we expect benefits beyond this year. We continue to expect full-year 2025 revenue to be in the $36 billion to $37 billion range, a mid-single-digit year-over-year increase, with growth in both services and equipment. We also expect continued expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin to high single digits as we deliver our growing backlog at better pricing and with better execution. We anticipate free cash flow to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. By segment, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Power, driven by higher gas services and equipment, and with power EBITDA margins between 13% and 14%. In wind, we expect revenue to be down mid-single-digit and the benefit of the one-time settlement from an offshore contract termination in 2024. We expect 2025 wind EBITDA losses to be between $300 million and $400 million, improving year over year, driven by onshore margin expansion within the high single-digit range, and slightly lower losses at offshore. In electrification, we anticipate continued strong demand and favorable price to drive mid to high teens organic revenue growth with 11% to 13% EBITDA margins as we deliver a more profitable backlog. We continue to expect 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be more second-half weighted, similar to last year. We anticipate typical gas services seasonality with the highest outage volume in the fourth quarter. In addition, wind EBITDA should improve in the second half compared to the first, largely due to the timing of onshore turbine deliveries already in backlog and improved services profitability. We also expect electrification earnings to grow sequentially through the year. Finally, at corporate, EBITDA can be uneven across quarters, like 2024, as it includes the portfolio activity at our financial services business. We also expect the timing of cost savings to be more back-end loaded as we drive additional G&A cost transformation. Overall, we drove strong results in 1Q 2025 with continued growth, significant margin expansion, and increasing free cash flow generation. We're very encouraged by the rising demand and consistently stronger performance we're seeing at power and electrification, as well as the improvements we're making at wind, enabled by our lean culture. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. We are pleased with our performance to start the year and are excited about our future as we help our customers electrify and decarbonize the world. I have increased conviction that GE Vernova is well-positioned to lead. Markets remain robust in power and electrification. At wind, markets remain tough. We continue to execute better in all three segments. We remain in the early stages of substantial margin expansion, and I am pleased with our momentum and adoption of Lean. We are reaffirming our 2025 guidance and are taking action to mitigate the current outline of tariffs and resulting inflation. Our balance sheet is solid, and we're growing free cash flow, which gives us confidence in our ability to invest in the businesses while also returning significant capital to shareholders. Our team is core to all of these efforts, and we are accelerating a stronger culture to ensure GE Vernova can meet its full potential. We are just getting started. With that, I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Please return in the queue if you have follow-ups. With that, operator, please open the line.
Operator: Our first question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Nicole.
Nicole DeBlase: Good morning. Can we start with the tariffs impact? I guess, can you talk about, like, what's embedded in the $300 to $400 million with respect to the impact on COGS on a gross basis versus the mitigation actions? And, you know, Scott and Ken, if you guys could talk a little bit more about what the mitigation focus is with respect to price versus G&A, and if you expect to fully offset tariffs by the time we get to 2026. Thank you.
Ken Parks: Yeah. We're obviously, as we start this and look at the $300 to $400 million, what we can tell you is that the teams are actively working to not only identify what we see as the 2025 impact, but as you pointed out at the last part of your question, continuing to drive this to where we can minimize the ongoing cost that it affects the company over time. Do believe in this environment that however tariffs end up, whether they be a continuing impact at the level that they're at, or that they do adjust down, that this will result in not just for us, but for all companies, a continued increase in the cost base. Therefore, it gives us the opportunity to take a look at our supply base as well as our G&A structure and make sure that I think, you know, we've used the words make sure that we are operating as a great industrial company both with a strong supply base as well as a G&A workforce. As far as gross to net, I'll stay away a little bit from the actual gross numbers. But what I will tell you are a couple of stats that are probably important and not also surprising. The biggest tariff impact to us really sits in the China base. And it's not so much that that's where the majority of our spend is, but it's really just based upon the rate of the tariff that you've heard that has been announced. We'd talked to you in the last couple of months as we've been trying to stay really, really close to the tariff situation. That when it was China, Canada, and Mexico, it impacted about 5% of our total direct spend, which is about $20 billion on an annual basis. Now with the expanded tariffs, you know, across the world beyond China, Canada, Mexico, and pulling in some of the spend on steel, which is an impact to us, it really impacts about a quarter of our total direct spend on an annual basis. So what are our mitigating actions? There are some places where we can pass it through under contracts that have been inflationary clauses, and we're looking actively at that right now. There are some of our contracts on the equipment side where we have the opportunity to talk to our customers about how this might come through with a change in law kind of clause. And if those changes in laws do create a higher cost base, we have the opportunity at a minimum to go back to our customers and talk about that. We're also looking at ways where we can move our supply chain around. Right? So in the case of China, there's probably about two-thirds of our China spend that today is already dual qualified in other places. Now that can't move immediately because we have contracts in progress, but we are looking at the activity that will help us to move that along and have the opportunity to reduce the cost overall. I'll wrap it up a little bit with the comment on the G&A side. You know, we back in March of 2024 when we started with our first investor day with the broader community, we talked about a target to really transform our G&A structure or call it our back-office structure that supports this new combined group of twelve companies that became GE Vernova. And we set a target to reduce cost by about a half a billion dollars by 2028 at that point in time. The teams have been working because we knew it was the right thing to do. We updated that number for you in December, said we were gonna achieve about $600 million now. Really, what we're doing through this process is accelerating that exact work that we've been working on for the last year and a half plus as we've been preparing to make this company even more streamlined from an operational perspective, both within the manufacturing side of the operations as well as in the back-office side. So lots of words to say, lots of things going on, but what I would close that off by saying is we don't put a checkbox and say, $300 to $400 million, count on that to be the number today and going forward. We will continue to work to make this company even better from a cost perspective.
Scott Strazik: I think Ken framed it perfectly. The only thing I would combine and bring together is to his point where our biggest impact is in China and about two-thirds of the China exposure, we can move fairly easily. The one business within the portfolio that we're maybe most affected on is offshore wind. And when you think about offshore wind with a two-year backlog work trying to expedite and close out, that's a business that we're not gonna invest money into to reallocate supply chain at this point. And maybe a more pronounced impact than some of the other businesses for just the state of affairs with offshore wind. So this really is an opportunity for us to simply become a better industrial company from when President Trump was at the Rose Garden and April second in the afternoon to Friday afternoon. We had countermeasures and plans in place forty-eight hours later. And we're gonna use this moment to become a better company together. Thanks, Nicole.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Mark.
Mark Strouse: Yeah. Good hey, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start with the Power segment. Appreciate the update on the slot reservations. Are you able to provide more color on those twenty-one gigs by customer type, by geography? I know you've got a lot of different irons in the fire, but how much of that is coming from data centers, for example? Thank you.
Scott Strazik: Sure, Mark. I mean, a couple important data points. I'd say of the total fifty gigawatts that we have on contract between the backlog and the slot reservation agreements, about sixty percent of that is in the US. So geographically, that gives you an idea for where this growth is coming. And then of the twenty-nine gigawatts that are already on backlog, when it comes to data centers, it's fairly negligible. I mean, we started at executing on a few smaller projects that have been announced like Crusoe and Texas but it's a very small amount. With the slot reservation agreements, that twenty-one gigawatts about a third of it is aligned with the data center build-out. So what you're seeing here is a very strong shift towards the US and in slot reservation agreements a lot of data center contracts that we expect to start to convert to orders in the second half of the year. Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Hey. Just quickly on just on the both the slot reservation agreement and the twenty-nine gigawatt that are already in your backlog, we often get the question on cancellation risk. Just given, you know, the gyrations that we're seeing particularly from the data center market. Can you maybe just talk about the stickiness or resiliency of both the backlog and the slot reservations?
Scott Strazik: Yeah. I mean, I'd start. I would just emphasize that even with the slot reservation agreements, I mean, we've got direct paid for today. The reason they're not on order today is because the customers are still working through their EPC contracts. They're still working through site selection and air permits. And as they do those things, although they've secured the timing of a slot, that gives us the confidence that the accuracy of that slot relative to the ultimate delivery is that much more firmed up to recognize it as an order. So the twenty-nine gigawatts that are on backlog, very firm on schedule. I think the twenty-one gigawatts that are on slot rescheduling, agreements, we could see some movement. On slots as final EPCs and insights are selected. But if you just take a step back, Joe, we're at a point now where twenty-six and twenty-seven are largely sold out. Twenty-eight is materially sold out, although we still have some slots we're selling. And I think the material development even in the last ninety days is we now have orders for twenty-nine. And we're in active discussions for slots in twenty-thirty. And I make that point to just really reinforce that it's very clear with the customers that there's a need for more gas over a longer period of time. There will be some movement amongst the slots I would expect, over the next five years. But I see very little quote, unquote cancellation risk. But there will be some movement that our supply chain will have to be nimble with as the slot reservation agreements turn to orders and final dates get finalized. Thanks for the question, Joe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets.
Chris Dendrinos: Yeah. Good morning and thank you. I wanted to ask about pricing dynamics. And, you know, previously in December, you all had indicated that you were taking pricing on gas turbines, and I'm curious what the environment is like today. Are you still able to push pricing further in gas and then also in electrification? Thanks.
Scott Strazik: Yeah. In gas, we continue to be in a price-up environment. I think the price on what we recognize in orders in the first half of twenty-five is gonna be better than the second half of twenty-four. The second half of twenty-five will be better than the first half. We continue to take price up, including in the last in the month of April in light of the tariff dynamic. To a further extent. Those pricing actions in April aren't yet leading to orders per se, but that continues to be the direction of travel. Those price-up moves in gas remain much steeper than where we are in electrification. We do continue to be gaining price in electrification, but at a slower rate than what we were experiencing in twenty-four, let's say. And it varies a little bit by geography and by product type. So switch gears in North America remain very strong in price. A little bit more of a normalization with some of our product and solutions in Europe as an example.
Ken Parks: Maybe just one thing to think about as you're thinking about the dynamic of our margins about this back in December, but just think about the timeline that it takes to go from a concept of an order to the booking of an order. And we gave you some numbers in January as we closed the year out that talked about another twelve full points of margin in our backlogs across the company and that coming in both the electrification segment, as well as the power segment, fairly sizably. I give you that because just as you think about that kind of growth in our margin and backlog that we quoted through the end of twenty-twenty-four, a lot of the pricing dynamics that Scott is talking to you right now where the prices have continued to go up as we've seen the acceleration of the demand. That incremental pricing really isn't already sitting in our order. Some of it's in our SRAs, but those as they continue to get finalized will create additional margin in our backlog which will support future growth and profitability in both the electrification and power businesses.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. Perfect.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Percoco: Good morning, Andrew.
Scott Strazik: Good morning. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a strong start to the year. I mean, you know, Scott, it doesn't sound like you're worried at all about the outlook like you're still very confident in what you're seeing. But I'm just curious, you know, since April second, since the implementation of the tariffs, since it appears the market's getting a lot more worried about a recession. Have you seen any change in behavior from your customers? I'm thinking particularly about the gas power business. You know, maybe some of the collocated data centers versus the traditional regulated utilities. Has there been any change in cadence of conversation or appetite from customers as we've seen the world change pretty dramatically in the last few weeks? And then maybe as a follow-up question to a prior question, are you changing at all your contract structure with these long lead time orders to maybe better protect yourself for future changes in tariffs? I'm just wondering if there's any fundamental changes to the contract structure. Does given the world that we're living in. Thank you.
Scott Strazik: Andrew, it's only a few weeks as you said. But, generally speaking, we continue to see the same growth trajectory today than we were projecting on April first. So what we're trying to emphasize in the call today is all indications are strong growth ahead. All that said, we do have some cost pressures now that we need to go after, and that's why we're calling out the $300 to $400 million for this year. I think Ken framed perfectly. The tariff dynamic for twenty-five, but we run the company with the view that the tariffs are gonna change, the inflation dynamics will evolve, but there's some cost pressure here. That we expect that then we need to countermeasure. And that's everything that Ken framed up. And if we do that well, we're gonna be all that much better a company on the other side. So the growth remains strong. We do have some tariff inflation pressure. We've got a countermeasure. And when it comes to the contracts, in many cases, we already were protected. In other cases, there are some adjustments that we're making with some contracts and some learnings that should protect us going forward. And I think those are really the key things.
Ken Parks: It's really a nuance to the contract question, but, you know, we've talked a lot in the last eighteen months or so about stronger underwriting to make sure that we're driving disciplined growth. And one of the things that we are truly looking at right now is not necessarily a change in contracting, but really looking closely at these cash curves. The reason I bring that up is we bring a lot of cash in upfront on the down payment. Scott mentioned, you know, approximately twenty percent of down payments on orders and SRAs. But in this environment where we're bringing things in to support those contracts at a higher cost, we will watch very closely when the milestone payments need to occur as we're incurring costs. So we always stay in a positive cash curve. I put that point out there because we often get the question around, you know, hey. You've got a great amount of money coming in on the upfront. How do you manage it through the process to ensure that you're positive the whole time? And that's one of the things that we're looking at closely now.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Scott Strazik: Morning, Nigel.
Ken Parks: Hey, Nigel.
Operator: Nigel, you may be on mute.
Nigel Coe: Sorry about that, guys. That's on mute. Thanks for the question. Just wanna stick with gas. I think, Scott, you mentioned that the minority of your reservations are data center. Which is a bit surprising. So I'm just wondering maybe you could weigh in with your perspective on what you're seeing in kind of your kind of front log of opportunity set for data centers as risk to gas. And then what is the key to getting these stock reservations into orders? Is it permitting, financing, and I know you said over the next twelve months or so, but just wondering what that looks like. Thanks.
Scott Strazik: You bet, Nigel. I mean, to go work it backwards, it really comes down to the customer securing their EPC. In some cases, they're choosing amongst a few sites think to yourself, they may have put in air permit requests in multiple states for potential build-outs. They're negotiating with the EPCs. And as those things firm up, we'll firm them up in orders. The reality with a lot of the slot reservation agreements is it's less the concern on financing capability. But until you've got that final site selection and EPC partner to build the plan, we aren't gonna put it in order because until those things are secured, there is some timing uncertainty. Although, I think with the capital and the cash these customers are providing for us, we don't view the cancellation risk to be very material. You are right. We said about a third of the twenty-one gigawatts are direct to a data center project. The other two-thirds are everything else that's happening in the world right now. I mean, we have electrification growth for more than just data centers. I mean, it's beyond base load power also because a healthy amount of these are also F-class gas turbines. It just strengthens the durability and the resiliency on the grid. So we don't think the one-third is a bad directional view of where the orders profile's going from here. Whether that be in the US or globally. Thanks, Nigel.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to start with the EBITDA margin guide. So you've got the power and electrification numbers on slide nine for the year at sort of, you know, thirteen-ish percent at the high end for electrification, the low end for power. But I guess if I look at your Q1 results and your Q2 comments, it looks like the first half in both power and electrification, you should be at the full-year margin numbers. And normally, you get a half-on-half step up in margins in those businesses in the second half. I'm just trying to understand, you know, anything you'd call out in any sort of bridge items or anything that would, you know, imply, you know, less than normal seasonal ramp? Is it the tariff waiting coming in hard in Q3? Is it plant capacity addition ramp-up costs in power? How much is just natural contingency? Any color on that, please?
Ken Parks: Yeah. Sure. The first quarter is obviously our smallest quarter of the year. So we are performing well in the businesses beyond exactly in line or better than where we expected to perform coming out of the gates. The guides that you talked about, we certainly do have a new placeholder in there. That wasn't there when we set the guide, which is the increase in cost due to tariffs that we've sized to the $300 to $400 million impact. The one that we can more immediately estimate what's gonna impact us is the one that hits the wind piece of the business. And that's because when you have a piece of the portfolio, specifically the offshore wind side, that's got a couple of contracts that are running at losses, pretty much anything that US estimate for incremental cost is gonna flow through and affect you right there. So that's one variable on that business that we do see a very clear path to how much it's gonna affect us. At this point in time, we've inclined that both the power and electrification businesses are running well against where we thought they were gonna be both on an order perspective and importantly on an execution perspective. But we do want to continue to measure how these tariffs are gonna roll into each of those businesses. That said, we still feel extremely confident of the guide that we've given you on all three businesses. As well as GE Vernova overall for the year.
Scott Strazik: It's a good start, Julian. It's ninety days. Let's get through the second quarter, and much like we did last year, we'll see where we are in the summertime.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you very much. Maybe following up on my namesake here a little bit in tone. Just the FCF range, you got about a half billion for the two to two and a half. You talk about three to four hundred million in tax here. Are there other mitigating impacts from a cash perspective just to understand there? Or is it just kind of an acceleration of the SG&A that we should be looking for in the back half of the year? And then related, if I can, your commentary on onshore your commentary on wind certainly took a little bit of a tone lower here. On onshore specifically, how do you think about that, especially given the top funnel seems to be slowing, given the permitting regime is late? How do you think about the longer-term trends on that front?
Scott Strazik: Ken, I'll start in the back half and then you do the first half. I'd say on wind, let's just keep context that we have over two hundred gigawatts of projects the country does in the interconnect queue. We continue to see there be an important role for wind to play, but we need to see progress on permitting. I think there's a real question on the price embedded in those projects that are in the interconnect queue. Where are the tax incentives going? I think clarity on permitting process today and ultimate incentives are gonna be important to drive clarity as those projects get into closure. First quarter was light. We remain cautious on the moment that we see that growth inflection in orders. But with that, backlog of pipeline, let's say, of projects, we're focused on controlling what we can control with the business, to get ourselves ready for that growth inflection point, and when it comes, we're highly confident that we'll capture our fair share. That's on wind. On the first half of the question, Ken, do you wanna hit on it?
Ken Parks: On the first half of the question, I would tell you that, you know, look, we will see what we typically see on profitability expanding as we move through the year. You know, our fourth quarter is our largest outage quarter and therefore service quarter, and the power businesses, which is one of our most profitable businesses, you will see more of the savings from SG&A. And in fact, the other piece of this is that in the wind business, we anticipated a softer first half. A second half because we anticipated based upon our backlog, where the turbines were gonna deliver and that's more of a second-half weighted dynamic as well. So those are really the big variables that drive first half to second half.
Scott Strazik: Great.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.
Scott Strazik: Morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Good morning. I think the EPA has been quite busy issuing directives and specifically with a focus on endangerment finding. And I guess the question I have when you talk to utilities, a, does this change their plans for spending and specifically do you see any changes to expectations of what's happening on the ground on actual permitting. Thank you.
Scott Strazik: No. On the first part of the question as to whether that's driving a change in customer behavior. Certainly, there's a lot of collaboration happening breakthrough with permitting reform both at a federal and a state level. The reality is it's hard to get a lot of I think this year is gonna be very much about firming up the tax cuts and how that gets funded, Andrew. And the permitting topic is probably follows. So that kinda directionally takes us into twenty-six more than twenty-five as I see it today.
Michael Lapides: Liz, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: This question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, Andrew.
Scott Strazik: Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. Orders that you said in Electrification had a difficult comparison in Q1, but in the recent past, you said that you expect a similar annualized growth rate in your equipment back up in twenty-five as you saw in twenty-four and twenty-three. Is that still what you expect Scott? And can you update us on your capacity capability in which and electrification? I know you did change twenty-five revenue guidance, but I know you've been pushing on capacity in that segment. So maybe you could update us on the potential increase in capacity that you could see as early as twenty-six.
Scott Strazik: You bet, Andrew. I would just reinforce what we've said in the past. I mean, our equipment backlog did grow by about $2 billion in the first quarter even though the year-over-year orders were down. We continue to expect backlog growth throughout this year and electrification that'll directionally have a similar trajectory of backlog growth in twenty-five relative to what you experienced in twenty-three and twenty-four. We are making progress on capacity generally, and you're gonna see that growth and revenue growth really throughout twenty-twenty-five into twenty-twenty-six. No change. And, again, a lot of this is within our control. Let's adding shifts. It's adding workers. It's quote-unquote easier stuff, and I don't make light of it than things that are out, you know, we're waiting for certain long lead parts to ramp up and businesses like gas. So I like our chances to continue to really ramp up our electrification revenue through twenty-five and into twenty-six from here.
Michael Lapides: Before we wrap up, let me hand it back to Scott for closing comments.
Scott Strazik: Michael, I appreciate it. At the wrap, I know we're short on time. I just would reinforce solid quarter, more importantly, great prospects from here. And as we wrap with a lot of humility and with a lot of appreciation, I just wanna continue to thank our customers for their trust. For our employees that are here every day to serve our customers and our owners. For all of you. And your interest in investment in GE Vernova, we're excited. This is our fifth earnings call. We've just passed a year, and we really feel like we're just getting started and the best is yet to come. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-22 07:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the GE Vernova's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Michael Lapides, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Michael Lapides: Welcome to GE Vernova's fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Scott Strazik; and CFO, Ken Parks. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's press release and in the presentation slides, all of which are available on our website. Please note that year-over-year commentary or variances on orders, revenue, adjusted and segment EBITDA and margin discussed during our prepared remarks are on an organic basis unless otherwise specified. We will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we do not undertake any obligation to do so. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties With that, I'll hand the call over to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We built a strong foundation in 2024 and our first year as an independent company. The investment super cycle in the electric power sector, driven the growing need for reliable power generation, grid modernization and decarbonization continues to accelerate. The world is shifting, relying more on electrons and megawatts, and this is changing the energy landscape, driving increased demand for our equipment and services. We are investing in decarbonization technologies within our own portfolio. For example, advancing carbon capture and sequestration. Late last year, we had a great customer milestone with the announcement of the Net Zero Teesside Power project expected to be the first gas-fired power station fully integrated with carbon capture technology. Last week, we also announced efforts jointly with multiple large US utilities to accelerate the deployment of our small modular nuclear reactor, the BWRX-300. We expect these technologies to impact the electric power system in the coming decades. Our progress in 2024 reinforced the important role we play at GE Vernova in electrifying and decarbonizing the world, while creating value for our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 4. I will spend a few minutes on each of our segments and how we are executing to meet demand. In power, market demand for gas generation is driving significant orders growth. For the full year, we built approximately 20 gigawatts of gas orders, double last year's level and secured 9 gigawatts of slot reservation agreements for new turbines, agreements that should convert to orders in 2025 to 2026. These agreements are tied to load growth in the US, partially driven by data center hyperscaler demand associated with AI, given our expansion plans to produce 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines per year beginning in the second half of 2026, up from 48 this year, we are positioning to meet this demand. We expect to grow our gas equipment backlog considerably in 2025, even as we ramp to ship approximately 20 gigawatts annually starting in 2027 and expect to remain at that level going forward. In addition to equipment demand growth, we are also seeing high-margin services growth in our installed base as customers aim to get more capacity and better performance out of their plants. Today, we deliver about $2 billion of upgrades annually in our gas business, and we anticipate this could grow by 50% by the end of the decade. Beyond Gas Power, we're having more active customer discussions on nuclear about the existing installed base of 65 plants here in the US that are running our technology today. We see an opportunity to add 5 gigawatts of nuclear power in the US between these existing facilities and potential restarts that could impact both nuclear and steam services beginning late in this decade. Against this backdrop, Power delivered 7% revenue growth and nearly 200 basis points of margin expansion in 2024. Overall, there is a lot to be excited about as our Power segment drives profitable growth, and significant free cash flow. In electrification, demand for our products remain strong with equipment orders more than doubling in 4Q 2024 compared to last year as customers modernize and invest in critical grid components such as transformers, switch gears and HVDC systems, which are essential to ensuring a reliable electricity system and effectively connecting new generation sources. We are seeing significant orders and backlog growth in both Europe and North America. And while Europe remains our largest market for grid, we are seeing orders accelerate in North America, which was our fastest-growing market in 2024. For the full year, Electrification achieved 18% revenue growth and over 500 basis points of margin expansion. Demand trends and improving execution are driving an acceleration of margin expansion increasing our confidence in our trajectory, and we expect this segment to deliver double-digit EBITDA margin in 2025 and expand further in 2016 and beyond. Turning to wind, we've made solid progress in our turnaround of this segment in 2024, cutting our EBITDA losses by almost half despite lower revenues. In onshore, we delivered high single-digit EBITDA margins on roughly flat revenue in 2024. The timing of an inflection in North America Onshore wind orders remains uncertain, but we expect to continue creating margin in this business with our focus on our key countries, improving quality and delivering cost-out initiatives. We are deploying more crews and cranes to insert technology that should improve the performance of the existing fleet and better serve our customers. As a result, we expect to grow these investments by over $100 million in 2025 versus 2024 with a heavy year-on-year increase in the first half as we accelerate our operational improvements in this business. In offshore, we're focused on improving execution and delivering on the approximately $3 billion remaining backlogs swiftly, safely and economically for our customers and ourselves. We are back to fully installing at both project sites. And as we discussed during our investor update in December, we expect to materially complete with Vineyard Wind in 2025, and we have a pathway to be mostly complete with Dogger Bank in 2026. We do not foresee adding to the offshore backlog without substantially different industry economics than what we see in the marketplace today. Looking ahead, we are applying what we've learned from the challenges in offshore wind to make us a stronger company going forward. Now over to the right-hand side of the page, we're focused on further embedding the lean culture across the organization driving operational improvement across safety, quality, delivery and cost. Let me take you through an example where the lean journey over the last seven years has driven real results and improved performance across all of SQDC. Earlier this month, I visited a gas power services and repair facility in Singapore that focuses on app and aged gas turbines. On safety, this facility has achieved decades of fatality-free operations supported through implementation of lean lines, which is have eliminated millions of mechanical lifts per year. On quality, we have lowered escapes at this facility by 25% from driving standard work and have used lean to reduce the amount of rework, generating cost savings. On delivery, through implementing eight lean lines, we have tripled the output, utilizing 50% less shop floor space and doubling the working hours on cost, by performing more database preventative maintenance and removing waste, we reduced machine costs by 50% and significantly increased productivity on existing machines. The Singapore example represents the culture we are building at GE Vernova as we accelerate our lean progress across the entire company and improve our own efficiency. There is significant growth we will achieve in this facility in the years ahead, all within the same four walls without pouring concrete or adding new cranes with a team that has fully embraced lean to serve our customers while preserving our capital for our shareholder accretive actions. Turning to Slide 5 on our financial performance in 2024. We booked $44 billion of orders with $35 billion in revenue delivered EBITDA margin expansion across all segments and more than $1 billion improvement in free cash flow. We grew our backlog to $119 billion and nearly doubled our cash balance to over $8 billion since spin from a combination of strong free cash flow generation and capitalizing on value creation opportunities such as the partial stake sales of GEV T&D India and China XD Electric, which generated $1.3 billion of pre-tax proceeds in 2024. As I said in December, this is representative of the culture we are building inside GE Vernova, when see opportunities to simplify our organization or to monetize parts of the portfolio at attractive prices, that creates capital that allows us to either invest back into our business or return to shareholders. We are going to act with urgency. In December, we raised our multiyear financial outlook and framed our cap allocation strategy, including a shareholder return program with our initial dividend and first buyback authorization, reflecting our conviction in the substantial value creation opportunities ahead. One of the primary drivers of our conviction on our path forward is the significant growth and margin expansion in our equipment backlog again in 2024, which I'll touch on in the next page. Over the past two years, we have added more than $6 billion of margin to our equipment backlog and given better pricing and more disciplined underwriting as this backlog has grown over 50% to $43 billion. We also expanded margin across all three segments, again, in 2024. Starting with Power and Electrification, we expect these segments to continue to materially grow their backlogs in 2025 at better margins. We see this clearly in front of us because of our wins in late 2024, such as the gas slot reservation agreements that we expect to turn into orders this year, along with the continued strong demand for electrification products driven by increased grid investments. Because these segments are longer cycle, we won't begin delivering on the majority of the high-margin orders of 2023 and 2024 until 2026 and beyond. Moving to wind. We project a stable to modestly lower backlog in 2025. Our backlog will reduce an offshore wind as we execute on the remaining $3 billion of backlog, but the margins will improve as this unprofitable business is completed. At onshore, we expect backlog should remain approximately flat with stable margins as we remain focused on key markets and disciplined underwriting, while we leverage our existing footprint and our supply chain. But as we said in December, we see incremental opportunity for the teams to expand margins that aren't projected in our external backlog today. That starts with our operating teams delivering variable cost productivity from things like sourcing savings and project execution at important milestones to secure lower cost and allow us to accrete margins as we execute. The teams are also working hard to accelerate capacity additions leveraging lean, which can create incremental slots we can sell at premium pricing. In summary, we are encouraged with our progress here, but it is just the beginning. When I look at our pricing success in gas in late our continued momentum in electrification with things like switch gears in North America and the internal expectations I have of the opportunity for teams to accrete incremental margin with variable cost productivity savings and I expect the margin we create in backlog in 2025 to be higher than our run rate the prior two years, further positioning GE Vernova for profitable growth over the long-term. With that, I will now turn the call over to Ken for more details on our fourth quarter performance.
Ken Parks: Thanks Scott. Turning to Slide 7, we finished 2024 strong with record quarterly orders and revenues and adjusted EBITDA margin reaching 10.2%. We increased our cash balance to over $8 billion with our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow generation and the benefit of two additional value-accretive portfolio actions. Demand remained robust in the fourth quarter as we booked $13.2 billion of orders, an increase of 22% year-over-year and approximately 1.3 times revenue. Equipment orders grew 44%, driven by strength in both Electrification and Power, partially offset by lower orders in onshore wind. As a result, our backlog continued to grow both year-over-year and sequentially across equipment and services, reaching $119 billion. Equipment margin and backlog remains healthy with overall margin and backlog increasing approximately 5 points versus year-end 2023, reflecting our focus on disciplined profitable growth. Revenue increased 9%, driven by both higher equipment and services revenues. Wind and electrification equipment revenue both grew double-digits, while services revenue increased 6% with growth in all three segments. In addition, price was positive in each segment. Adjusted EBITDA grew to approximately $1.1 billion, up 85% and EBITDA margin expanded 440 basis points. We delivered our first quarter of double-digit margins with expansion in all three segments, driven by more profitable volume, price and productivity, which more than offset inflationary impacts. In addition, we benefited from previously announced restructuring actions, primarily at wind and power. We delivered approximately $600 million of positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. As expected, free cash flow decreased year-over-year, primarily due to lower customer down payments at wind and actions we've taken to improve cash linearity across the quarters as we continue to more closely align the timing of disbursements and collections. Working capital in the quarter was an approximately $200 million cash benefit, which combined with our stronger EBITDA, more than offset higher CapEx investments to support future capacity expansion along with higher cash taxes on higher EBITDA. We're using lean to drive better cash management and linearity. For example, the electrification team implemented new standard work and daily management to improve the timing of invoices and reduce disputes. These actions drove a reduction in days sales outstanding by four days, resulting in approximately $80 million of additional free cash flow. We continue to leverage our lean culture across GE Venova to deliver better financial results. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we generated approximately $600 million of incremental pre-tax proceeds by selling partial ownership stakes in our GEV T&D India and China XD Grid businesses. These proceeds are classified outside of free cash flow and the gain was removed from adjusted EBITDA. We remain the majority shareholder of GEV T&D India and currently own 12% of China XD. Combined with our fourth quarter free cash flow, these proceeds increased our cash balance to $8.2 billion. Our strong cash balance and further improved free cash flow profile enabled us to frame our capital allocation strategy at our investor update on December 10, while maintaining our firm commitment to an investment-grade balance sheet, we expect to return at least one-third of cash generated to shareholders, starting with a $1 per share annualized dividend and our $6 billion share repurchase authorization. In late December, we initiated our share repurchase activity, buying approximately $3 million in the month. We're pleased with our full year 2024 financial performance. As Scott said, it was strong, but it was just the start of where we expect to go. During the year, we booked over $44 billion of orders led by double-digit equipment growth in both power and electrification, Services orders increased 12%, largely due to the strength of Power. We delivered approximately $35 billion in revenue, driven by high-teens growth in electrification, and high single-digit growth in power. We doubled our adjusted EBITDA to over $2 billion and expanded margins nearly 300 basis points year-over-year, with significant improvement in each segment. We also made solid progress towards our lower adjusted G&A target by achieving an almost $200 million reduction in 2024. Finally, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow a year-over-year improvement of $1.3 billion, primarily driven by our stronger EBITDA. Our growing backlog with higher margin provides an excellent foundation for further improvement in our financial performance ahead. Turning to Power on slide 8. Power delivered strong full year 2024 results led by the Gas Power business. Power orders grew 28%, given robust demand for gas equipment and 10% growth in services, which combined, increased adjusted backlog by more than $4 billion. Power grew revenue 7% for the year with Gas Power growing 9%. Power EBITDA increased by more than 20%, expanding margins by 180 basis points driven by services strength, more profitable equipment and continued productivity, partially offset by inflation. In the fourth quarter, Power orders grew 24% led by high equipment at Gas Power and hydro, partially offset by lower services. In Gas Power, equipment orders increased nearly 80% as we booked 24 heavy-duty gas turbines, including four HA units. This was almost triple the number of heavy-duty units booked in fourth quarter of 2023. Power Services orders remained strong, but declined 6%, largely due to a strong fourth quarter 2023 gas transactional services comparison. Revenue increased low single digits as Power Services growth and higher HA deliveries more than offset lower aero derivative shipments. EBITDA margins expanded to approximately 15%, led by gas power from services volume, productivity and price, more than offsetting the impact of inflation. Looking at the first quarter of 2025, we expect continued year-over-year growth in gas equipment orders. We also anticipate low single-digit revenue growth at Power but a low single-digit decline on a reported basis as a result of the impact of the divestiture of a portion of the steam business in the second quarter of 2024. We expect EBITDA margins of approximately 10% to 11% as productivity and price should more than offset inflation as well as higher investments at nuclear and gas. Turning to slide 9. Wind results continued to progress in 2024, improving full year EBITDA losses by 42%. Onshore had a solid second half to 2024 and achieved approximately 7% EBITDA margins for the year. Offshore performance was challenging as we recorded approximately $1 billion of incremental contract losses in 2024, largely due to the impacts of blade events and project execution delays. These costs were partially offset by a $300 million gain recorded in the third quarter from a previously canceled offshore project. We remain focused on continuing to improve results through better quality, delivery and cost productivity across wind. In the fourth quarter, wind orders decreased 41%, driven by lower onshore wind given we booked our largest ever onshore order in the fourth quarter of 2023, the 2.4 gigawatt SunZia wind project in the US. Excluding this large order, onshore orders declined slightly. In offshore, we remain focused on executing our existing challenged backlog. Wind revenue increased 21% in the quarter on higher onshore equipment deliveries, partially offset by lower offshore revenue. We've now restarted blade installations at the Vineyard Wind project in December. Wind was modestly profitable in fourth quarter of 2024 with EBITDA improving approximately $300 million year-over-year. Onshore delivered its most profitable quarter in over three years on strong volume, price and productivity, partially offset by higher services costs as we deployed more crews and cranes as we focus on improving installed fleet availability. As we've discussed, we remain cautious on the timing of an onshore order inflection in North America as customers continue to navigate growing interconnection queues and higher interest rates. We do expect the Wind segment to grow revenue mid single digits in the first quarter of 2025 driven by higher onshore equipment deliveries. EBITDA losses should remain relatively consistent year-over-year as the impact of higher onshore volume is offset by increased services cost to further improve the operating performance of the installed onshore fleet. Turning to Electrification. Strong demand and price resulted in high-teens full year orders and revenue growth with EBITDA margins expanding to 9% in 2024. Electrification equipment orders grew nearly 20%, which further increased the equipment backlog to $20 billion. Electrification revenue grew 18%, led by Grid Solutions and margins expanded 520 basis points from higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity. In the fourth quarter, orders were robust at approximately $4.8 billion, roughly 2.2 times fourth quarter revenue, more than doubling year-over-year driven by the growing need for grid equipment and services. We booked two large HVDC orders in the quarter in Germany and Korea. And demand also remained strong for switchgears, particularly in North America. Revenue increased 12%, even compared to a strong fourth quarter 2023, which benefited from the ramp in volume that started late last year. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by higher volume and price at Grid Solutions where we saw meaningful growth in switchgears and substation equipment. The segment delivered another quarter of double-digit EBITDA margins with 500 basis points of margin expansion on more profitable volume, higher price and increased productivity. In the first quarter of 2025, we anticipate solid equipment orders at healthy margins. Electrification revenue should increase at a growth rate in line with our full year guidance led by Grid Solutions. We expect year-over-year margin expansion similar to what we delivered in the fourth quarter from higher volume, productivity and favorable pricing. Consistent with prior years, we expect first quarter revenue and EBITDA margin to be lower sequentially, primarily due to the timing of project milestones, which tend to be more second half weighted. I'll now turn to Slide 11 to discuss GE Vernova guidance further. For the first quarter based on our expectations for the segments, which I've already outlined, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. We also expect positive free cash flow in the first quarter, a significant improvement year-over-year, driven by our continuing focus on better cash linearity along with increased EBITDA, partially offset by higher CapEx. As discussed in December, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in all four quarters this year. For the full year, we're reaffirming the 2025 guidance we provided at our investor update on December 10. We continue to expect full year 2025 revenue to be in the $36 billion to $37 billion range, a mid-single-digit year-over-year increase, with growth in both services and equipment. We also expect continued expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin to high single digits as we deliver our growing backlog at better pricing and with better execution. We anticipate free cash flow to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. By segment, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Power, driven by higher gas services and equipment with EBITDA margins between 13% and 14%. In Wind, we expect revenue to be down mid-single digits, given our continued geographic selectivity in onshore and the benefit of the one-time settlement from an offshore contract termination in 2024. We expect 2025 wind EBITDA losses to be between $200 million and $400 million, improving year-over-year, driven by onshore margin expansion within the high single-digit range, and slightly lower losses at offshore. In electrification, we anticipate continued strong demand and favorable price to drive mid- to high-teens organic revenue growth with 11% to 13% EBITDA margins as we deliver a more profitable backlog. We expect 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be more second half weighted similar to last year. We anticipate the typical gas services seasonality with the highest outage volume in the fourth quarter. In addition, wind EBITDA should improve in the second half compared to the first, largely due to the timing of onshore turbine deliveries already in backlog and improved services profitability. Finally, we expect electrification earnings to grow sequentially through the year. Overall, we built a solid foundation in 2024, delivering significant margin expansion with growing free cash flow generation. In 2025, we expect to drive even stronger results as we deliver our growing more profitable backlog with improved execution enabled by our lean culture. With that, I'll turn it back Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. We are pleased with our performance this year and are excited about our future as we help our customers electrify and decarbonize the world. 2024 has increased my conviction, the GE Vernova is well positioned to lead. In Power, it's about delivering continued margin expansion with growing free cash flow, both from equipment as well as strong services. In wind, it's about disciplined margin expansion in onshore, while we position for the market inflection in quality and execution in offshore. For electrification, it's about delivering an accelerated high-margin profitable growth from rising demand for grid technologies. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi-decade growth for GE Vernova and continue creating value for our stakeholders. As we head into 2025, I am optimistic about the future, and we are just getting started. With that, I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of the call.
Michael Lapides: Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Please return to the queue if you have follow-ups. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Percoco: Hey, good morning, guys.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Percoco: Good morning. So, yeah, maybe just to start out at a very high level here. I mean, you guys gave a very comprehensive update back in December, but it's been a pretty active 48 hours or so with the new administration certainly some positives to point on the AI investments and the gas infrastructure side, but also some potential headwinds that we're seeing on wind. So, can you maybe just give us your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about this incoming administration and how it might impact the outlook across each of your businesses?
Scott Strazik: You bet, Andrew. I mean, I'll start. I just would take it a step back beyond maybe the last 48 hours, and let's just talk about the last six weeks since we were together December 10 for Analyst Day. And I would say in our largest scale businesses, the market continues to get stronger. I mean, we see accelerated activity in pipeline and gas that's very focused in the US, but not just the US. And what I'd emphasize on gas is it's becoming an even more diversified demand cycle and that you can start to see in the numbers. I mean, we had 25 HAs that had an order this year. We also had 20F class units. We had north of 40 aeroderivative units. So the diversity of demand just continues to get stronger. Similar theme in grid. Even in the last six weeks, we closed the year very strongly with grid orders. The pipeline remains very strong. But the diversity of the pipeline is really what I would emphasize. I mean, this was a business that two years ago was basically a European company. Today, we've taken a business that was $6 billion of backlog two years ago. It's $20 billion today. Yeah, a little bit more than half of that is still Europe, but 20% to 25% is in North America. The other 20% to 25% is the rest of the world with Asia really growing. So the diversity of demand in grid is just giving me that much more confidence in the durability of those two businesses. On the other side, to your question on wind, it remains soft. I mean, we talked about a generally flat financial projection with wind through the next few years. That's still really what we see six weeks later from where we were on December 10. We're cautious on when that inflection point is going to come in North America. We have been for a while, we still are today, and we're going to keep focused on executing and serving our customers as well as we can there. But the market fundamentals are softer there, certainly relative to the other two large businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. And maybe just wanted to ask my question around the power organic sales outlook for year. So you grew, I think, low single0digit or you're guiding for low single digits growth starting out the year organically, you've got that mid single-digit guide for the year. Maybe help us understand sort of how we should think about that pace of acceleration through the balance 2025. And also help us understand within Power Service, how we should think about the growth there? Should it be equivalent to equipment this year at sort of mid single digits? Or do you see opportunities on the transactional side of power service maybe to get higher volume and price as gas power utilization rises? Thank you.
Scott Strazik : Thanks, Julian. Maybe if we just think about kind of the pace that business, I would say, if you think about equipment and services, which is really how you broke down your question, as we look at what's in backlog, while we're growing at a slightly slower organic pace early in the year, and we're still projecting mid single-digit growth overall for that business for the year. It's really just built upon how we expect the backlog to roll out. So the build cycle for that -- for the equipment piece. So nothing surprising there. We overall have about 90% of our overall GE Vernova volumes in backlog today. So that gives us really good visibility on how it's going to roll. So I wouldn't take any indication of maybe a slightly slower first quarter growth against the full year guide that's higher than that, is anything other than us having the knowledge of how that backlog is going to roll out. On the services side, there's certainly opportunity as we're in this cycle of higher utilization to see opportunities, not only on the contract service part of our portfolio, but also the transactional part of our service business, which equates for about half of the overall total. So we feel really good about good about where we're starting, and we feel the visibility into the backlog and the visibility into the service outages that will take us to the right place on the guide.
Ken Parks : Julian, the only thing I'd emphasize is that we talked about in December, this being really the last year at mid single-digit revenue growth with an acceleration to high single digits in 2026 and beyond in this segment. And I spent a lot of the of the first month year with some of our suppliers and partners in this space and continue to have real confidence and conviction that they're capacitizing as we need them to for this growth that comes in 2016 and beyond.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.
Scott Strazik : Good morning, Mark.
Ken Parks : Good morning, Mark.
Mark Strouse : Hi. Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So when we were together in December, you gave some color about increasing your pricing on the gas power side. Just curious if you can talk about order activity since then, or maybe just kind of general customer receptivity to that? And do you have any near-term plans to raise pricing further? Thank you.
Scott Strazik: Sure, Mark. I'd say, again, I'm picking on words a little bit, but the truth of it is an explicit orders in the last six weeks, there hasn't been an incredible amount of orders activity, right, because we, kind of, trended into the holidays and it's early in the new year. What I would say, though, is the intensity of discussions for more and bidding activity right now and the receptivity to pay for, what I'll call, premium slots in the out years going, and I'm talking premium slots 2028, 2029 really, to a large extent. The discussions are much more focused on how can the end customers fulfill than the last dollar of price. I wouldn't say there's been another explicit price increase since we were together December 10th, because the reality is we had, at that point, had a very, very productive month of November and had just taken the market up another level. So that hasn't changed. But I would not say at all in gas that the pricing dynamics are the main event. It's us continuing to partner with these end customers on their ability to actually generate the power when they need it. And we'll continue to do everything we can to serve them, but also maximize our economics.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah, thanks. Good morning guys.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Nicole.
Nicole DeBlase: Can we talk a little bit about last week's SMR announcement, I thought that was really interesting. I guess, to what extent can deployment actually be accelerated? And does this come with increased customer interest in the SMR offering? Thank you.
Scott Strazik: Nicole, I think it's a great question. I'm glad to get a chance to spend a little bit more time talking about that. I mean, it is a longer term play for us, but last week was meaningful because when you think about where we were previous to that, our launch customers in North America with Ontario Power Generation and Tennessee Valley Authority. These are two customers that are 100% government owned. Last week's announcement was that next shift forward, having Duke, having AEP join into the mix and join into the consortium to invest in this product and commit towards our technology for projects that they have slotted for new zero carbon power between 2032 and 2034 in the US. So the activity of customer interest here, not just in the US, but also outside US is only strengthening. I mean, to give you a little bit more color, I was in Japan, the first week of the new year. We've turned down two of our BWX nuclear plants in Japan very recently. There's another 18 in Japan that have not been restarted that is only accelerating in activity. And I generally spend the first week of the new year in Japan for the New Year's greetings. It's the first year I've left the market saying, okay, this is happening now. These plants are going to be turned back on, whether it be from the federal government or from the local communities because of the clear need and we continue to see more activity on upgrades and up rates into the installed base in North America. We've talked in the past. We've got 65 plants running with our technology. We will add more megawatts to those existing plants and more and more customers with those plants are coming back us and saying, within the security apparatus of the existing plant, we can fit an SMR. And then when you've already got the security infrastructure that creates a lot of economic and operational arbitrage for them. So, you can hear the enthusiasm in my voice on this. Can we move it to the left earlier than the first plant being commissioned in in Ontario 2029? I don't think that will happen. The first plant will be commissioned in Canada in 2029. There's even more confidence that in the U.S., many more plants can be commissioned, let's just call it, 2032 and beyond, but this is about the next decade. It's not going to create a substantial amount of incremental megawatts until we get there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Yes, good morning.
Scott Strazik: Good morning Andrew.
Ken Parks: Hey Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Yes, the headlines like Constellation buying Calpine seems people are getting excited about natgas. As we think about services and the scope of your activities as price of gas is going up over the next several years. Just trying to understand what happens to the scope of your service activities as price of gas -- if price of gas structurally goes up? And if you are starting to have those conversations with your customers?
Scott Strazik: Andrew, if you just take the S-class fleet, which is our largest fleet in North America we have over 700 F-class gas turbines in the U.S. that we have incremental technology that we can insert into the existing installed base in the U.S. and drive output and efficiency savings. And that's just the F-class fleet in North America as an illustration amongst the 7,000 gas turbines we have globally, and that's what we're going to see happen. Admittedly, today, the discussions with incremental investments is more focused on megawatts than it is efficiency. I agree with your train of thought on where gas pricing is going, but the discussion is much more on we need every megawatt we can get right now and how can you operationally allow us to generate those megawatts, even if in the end, it leads to a few more outages over time because we run the gas turbines at higher firing temperatures as an example. But what this is clearly going to lead to is the scope per outage is going up because the amount that our customers are willing to invest in technology at that outage event is going up for -- at the moment, megawatts, but ultimately, efficiency will matter, too. So, that's why we've talked for the better part of, call it, the last four months about the fact that we see the upgrades growing directionally 50% by end of the decade in the gas business because of this market opportunity, and a lot of it's going to be in North America and the demand signals with more investment into gas like you alluded to with Constellation is a great indicator.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Julien.
Ken Parks: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Nice to chat with you guys. Thank you very much. Hey, look, you made allusion to this earlier about sort of the diversification in your turbine sales, right, not just H-class but Fs and Aero. Can you speak a little bit more to the extent to which that might be accelerating given the availability dynamics and the supply constraints? And how that might drive volumetric upside, where folks might have otherwise thought you were constrained in what you can do in that kind of 2026, 2027 time frame?
A – Scott Strazik: Julien, thanks for the question. It's not going to materially change 2026. At the end of the day, the same amount of for things and [ph] at least 2026 is really kind of what we're going to have to be clear. I mean we're working this very hard. But the premise of your question is spot on in the sense that the more that we do F-class gas turbines as an example, we've been making them for 25 years. it is easier for us to make an F-class gas turbine than it is an H. The supply base has an ability to ramp those faster. And the reality is, yes, there's a lot of baseload power needs. A lot of the data centers, AI will be H-class because the end customers are underwriting a business case where they need to power 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the efficiency is -- again, it will be a baseload H-class. At the same time, you look at where the reserve margins are today and PJM and ERCOT and where pricing is going, and there's a lot of simple cycle pipeline demand growth for F-class, that makes a lot of sense. And the truth of it is, those are easier for us to make. And as we continue to drive our lean improvement and I'll be back down in Greenville, South Carolina next week with the team for the entire week to kind of partner with them on our path forward, that diversification of gas turbines, including, let's call it, more mature gas turbines like F-class does give us a little bit more of a kick in our step that we're going to find every opportunity we can to serve our customer base with as many gas turbines as practical, but we've got to balance that with what our supply base is able to serve. And in that regard, today, nothing's changed from our previous comments that will be at directionally 20 gigawatts by 2027. And steady there going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Scott Strazik: Hey, Andrew.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.
Scott Strazik: Good morning.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Scott, could you give more color into your commentary regarding accelerating capacity expansion to sell premium slots that you have on Slide 6. I think at the Investor Day, you were careful to say you're going to be thoughtful and down quickly, you grow capacity. And maybe Slide 6 commentary today seems slightly more appointed. I know you just talked about power and no real changes there, but what about an electrification? Are you potentially going to accelerate capacity a little bit on that side of the business?
Scott Strazik: Yes. And that comment is exactly, Andrew, as you said, more applicable to electrification. I'm looking forward to being at one of our factories in Pennsylvania in a few weeks for the better part of a week that makes switch gears for us. And we do see opportunity to continue to accelerate capacity build-out and electrification that is in North America in the near term, leveraging some of our industrial footprint. And as we do, the ability to sell those premium slots is something we're very, very focused on. So we did try to talk about this in December that, if there was an upside case within our, call it, what's in, what's out of our by 2028 guide. We did talk about accelerated fulfillment and electrification being the most applicable example. And that remains the case. And we've got a team that's incredibly focused on making progress there and a leadership team that's here to serve them, because the market needs everything we can give them. And we're hopeful we're going to ramp that up even faster. And with it, we should have fulfillment and price opportunity.
Ken Parks: Yeah. And I think the only thing I would add to that is that One of the things we called out in December, which is still true only a few weeks later, is a big portion of the electrification capacity expansion really isn't driven by bricks and order, right? The lean -- lean culture within some of the businesses that are faster flow businesses, less kind of like project moving through the factory, but flow businesses. We're getting a significant amount of capacity expansion with lean initiatives, which are some of the most effective from a return perspective because you're not putting that bricks and mortar in the ground forever.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Ritchie: Hey, good morning, guys. So look, I think very few of us would have thought that over the past two years, you'd be able to grow that electrification equipment backlog to over $20 billion. It's pretty incredible. As you're looking out for 2025, Scott, any thoughts around how much that backlog can build? And then specifically as it relates to North America, really encouraging to hear that, that business is now 20%, 25% of your business today. What's the opportunity in North America?
Scott Strazik: Substantial. It is -- it continues to be the part of the business that as we lean into the front end, I continue to be encouraged that the GE Vernova symmetry synergy helps the most on the front end. We continue to educate our customers on our offerings in electrification, and we're like in the response. And I've alluded to the fact that I spent a week in Asia to start the year in both Singapore and Japan, that's applicable in those markets, too. We are not a known commodity, but there are industrial footprint opportunities for us to invest into in both Asia and North America that are attractive and that are -- that are things that we're going to keep working very hard right now. So, of our three business segments, Joe, it's very clear to me from a commercial perspective beyond market growth, us simply gaining share, let's say, within the market regardless of where it goes. There's a lot more for us to do in electrification. And I expect that $20 billion equipment backlog, to grow substantially in 2025 and beyond as we continue to run this business better.
Michael Lapides: Operator, we have time for about one last question.
Operator: This question will come from Moses Sutton with BNP Paribas.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Moses.
Ken Parks : Hi, Moses.
Moses Sutton: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to continue on gas turbine pricing. At this point, new CCGTs are costing 2,000 per kilowatt all-in and rising perhaps. Is your content still tracking at 30% to 35% of that new build cost? And are pricing and bids. Is there any differentiation between, I don't know, like a U.S. 2027 versus an international 2028, which might have a little more open room? So just thoughts on that price level against the total content and then variation by geography and shipment near? Thanks.
Scott Strazik : Moses the directional numbers you're giving for an H-class gas turbine in North America or a plant build are directionally accurate today. And our share of that is directionally accurate too. So I wouldn't think it's different than what you're saying. The only thing maybe I would distinguish is we're very quickly getting to a point that the premium slot dynamic, there's not really a difference between 2027 and 2028 right now. I mean I think if you want to start to distinguish between schedule and capacity, it's really turning in more 2028 versus 2032, okay. And internationally, there are markets that will plan out that far. That may lead to modestly different way to think about things, but 2027, 2028, we are going to be talking about 2029 in gas before the year is over on some of these calls. That's very clear to me because we've got 20 gigawatts of capacity. We're going to have a strong orders here. We're going to fill the bathtub, so to speak, of those 20 gigawatts per year fairly quickly and be into the out years. So I don't think we're going to be making much of a pricing distinction between 2027 and 2029 right now. It's really going to continue to be a challenge of how the customers secure not just our equipment, but everything else required. The EPC support is going to be a big open switch and one that I'm going to invest a lot of time and in 2025 because I continue to believe that could be one of the bigger challenges towards fulfillment is just whether the projects stay on schedule, notwithstanding our explicit gas turbine deliveries. And we have a number of strategic sessions in the first quarter with those EPCs to just stay very aligned on their schedule and ours. So thanks for the question.
Michael Lapides : Before we wrap up, let me turn it back to Scott for closing comments.
Scott Strazik : No, everybody. I just want to thank everyone again for your continued interest in GE Vernova, as I do on all of these calls, I think it's important to recognize our employees in our first year as a public company. I have an incredible amount of pride to lead this group, a lot of optimism and ambition for the company that we're creating. I have a huge appreciation for the customers that are leaning in with us right now on the opportunity and the excitement they have for the art of the possible for what GE Vernova can be. So we had a good first year, but there's nobody inside the walls of GE Vernova that's celebrating right now. We've got our feet on the ground. We're very focused on the opportunity in front of us in these markets and serving it and going into a New Year with a lot of energy and a lot of optimism. So, thanks for giving us the time today, and we look forward to seeing all of you out in the field over the next few months.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-23 07:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the GE Vernova's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz [ph] and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Michael Lapides, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Michael Lapides: Thank you. Welcome to GE Vernova's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Scott Strazik; and CFO, Ken Parks. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's Form 10-Q, press release and in the presentation slides, all of which are available on our website. Please note that year-over-year commentary or variances on orders, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and margin discussed during our prepared remarks are on an organic basis. We will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we do not undertake any obligation to do so. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainty. With that, I'll hand the call over to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We continue to gain confidence and conviction in the growth trajectory ahead for GE Vernova. We are in the early innings of an investment super cycle in the expansion and decarbonization of the electric power system driven by increasing demand for power, increased focus on energy security and rising grid investments. The GE Vernova purpose has never been more clear and we are excited to have published our first sustainability report last month. Our objective with this report is to provide metrics on our progress in electrifying and decarbonizing the world while ensuring the communities we operate in thrive and simultaneously get better each year in conserving resources with our own operations. A quick discussion on a few of the sustainability metrics we'll measure and update each year. In 2023, we added 29 gigawatts of new capacity to the grid globally with 42% in developing markets. The carbon intensity of this capacity is approximately 25% below the global average carbon intensity of the existing global power sector and has the potential to avoid 20 million metric tonnes of CO2 per year. I share these examples to reinforce our true north in both adding capacity to the grid each year while driving towards a more sustainable electricity system. These sustainability metrics align our broader purpose with our multiyear financial ambitions to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 4. I will spend a few minutes on each of our segments. Our Power segment led by Gas Power delivered strong double-digit orders and revenue growth with over 200 basis points of margin expansion. Power orders increased 34% this quarter, driven by substantial equipment demand both for HA and aeroderivative units as well as services. Year-to-date, we have booked approximately 14 gigawatts of orders for new gas turbines, nearly double last year's level. We expect the fourth quarter to be our largest equipment orders quarter of 2024. As discussed in September, we have now secured capacity to deliver between 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines per year starting in 2026, up from 55 in recent years. As we look at the anticipated orders profile for 2026 and 2027, even with this capacity expansion, manufacturing slots are scarce. In addition to equipment demand growth, we are seeing services demand in our installed base grow meaningfully. As customers aim to get more capacity and better performance out of their plants, we expect greater demand for upgrades, driving gas services growth. Today, we deliver about $2 billion of upgrades annually in our gas business and we anticipate this could grow by 50% by the end of the decade. There is a lot to be excited about in our Power segment. Electrification is our fastest-growing segment, delivering a 24% revenue increase in the quarter, driven by stronger volume and price. Demand for our products remain strong as customers modernize and invest in critical grid products, such as HVDC systems, transformers and switchgears which are essential to ensuring a reliable electricity system and connecting new generation sources. Over the last 2 years, we have seen our equipment backlog grow meaningfully and profitably and we are on track to more than triple this backlog by year-end '24 from year-end '22 levels of just over $6 billion. This quarter, electrification achieved double-digit EBITDA margin for the first time with expansion of nearly 700 basis points. Demand trends and improving execution are driving an acceleration in margin expansion, increasing our confidence in our trajectory going forward and we expect this business to consistently deliver double-digit EBITDA margins from here. Turning to Wind. In onshore, we continue to improve on our profitability, expanding margins and delivering our most profitable quarter in a number of years. We remain cautious on the timing of the inflection for orders but have positioned this business to deliver high single-digit EBITDA margins on approximately flat revenue this year. We continue to have confidence that as we drive onshore revenue growth, as early as 2026, we can continue to accrete margins in this business. In offshore, we've had a difficult 4 months and are disappointed given the impact on our customers and on our financial results with a significant loss we took this quarter. We have finalized root cause analysis and confirmed the blade issue at Vineyard Wind was caused by a manufacturing deviation from our factory in Canada. We have been very intentional, thorough, not rushed in re-evaluating our blade quality across offshore wind in totality. As we reaccelerate progress on our projects, we are proactively strengthening some of the blades, either back at the factory or in the field to improve quality and readiness for their intended useful life. We continue installing turbines in Dogger Bank, while at Vineyard Wind; we are installing towers and the cells and are very close to resuming blade installation. Looking ahead, we're focused on improving execution and delivering on the approximately $3 billion backlog in the safest, highest quality delivery model that makes economic sense for our customers and ourselves. We do not foresee adding to this backlog without substantially different industry economics than what we see in the marketplace today. I'm proud of our team as they execute in this difficult environment and appreciate the engagement with our customers. I remain confident that we will return the Wind segment to profitability in the fourth quarter. Now over to the right side of the page. We're focused on further embedding lean across the organization, driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery and cost. Safety is our number one priority. And unfortunately, we experienced a fatality this quarter in an onshore wind site in Sweden. We are working to accelerate the company-wide adoption of our lifesaving rules deployed earlier this summer. Turning to quality; an example of how we are implementing lean in our onshore wind business is our workhorse turbine strategy. Today, we have over 2,000 of our workhorse 2.8-megawatt wind turbines that we've commissioned in the last 2 years. These units are performing at approximately 98% availability due to our focus on reduced variance and repeatable operations to drive better quality. On delivery, we are leveraging lean to increase output of our existing manufacturing footprint with limited capital spend needed. As an example, in our power transmission business within grid, we will double the capacity of the manufacturing output of this business, with 75% of the expansion coming from core lean improvements driven by better asset and labor utilization. The remaining 25% of the capacity increase will come from site expansions. On cost, we announced a planned reduction in our offshore wind headcount as part of our efforts to streamline our wind business to make it more efficient and to improve results. We are operating the Wind segment as 1 global business with 3 main product lines, 2 in onshore wind and 1 in offshore wind, with increased visibility, improved learnings across the teams and a better cost structure. We are also driving meaningful productivity with our suppliers in the large electrification projects that we have secured in backlog in the last 21 months. This progress continues to strengthen our confidence in our ability to deliver this growing backlog in electrification for our customers while substantially accreting margins in this business going forward. Turning to the next slide for a look into our third quarter financial performance. We delivered a solid quarter with double-digit orders with services up almost 30% and double-digit revenue growth as well as significant margin expansion at power, electrification and onshore wind. That said, our quarter could have been even stronger if not for the quality and execution challenges in offshore wind which we are addressing and learning from to make us a stronger company going forward. We generated substantial free cash flow and increased our cash balance from $5.8 billion in 2Q to $7.4 billion in 3Q. During the quarter, we sold a 16% ownership stake in GE Vernova T&D India, part of the Electrification segment at an attractive valuation that generated approximately $700 million of pre-tax proceeds. This transaction demonstrates how we intend to run GE Vernova. We will monetize assets across our portfolio when we see attractive opportunities to do so, enabling us to invest more in our core businesses to simplify the company and return capital to our shareholders. We are reaffirming our full year 2024 guidance. We look forward to discussing our multiyear financial outlook as well as our capital allocation strategy at our Investor Update in New York on December 10. I'm more confident today in the future of our business than ever. And I will now turn the call over to Ken for more details on our third quarter performance.
Ken Parks: Thanks, Scott. Turning to Slide 6. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results with double-digit orders and revenue growth led by Power and Electrification. Margins expanded year-over-year across power, electrification and onshore wind but were offset primarily due to additional contract losses at offshore wind. Importantly, we generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter driven by strong working capital management, including improved linearity. Orders grew 17%, driven by services which increased 28% with double-digit growth across all 3 segments. Equipment orders grew approximately 8%. Power and electrification equipment orders grew substantially, partially offset by lower equipment orders at wind. Our backlog of $118 billion grew both year-over-year and sequentially and equipment margin and backlog remains healthy, reflecting our disciplined profitable growth priority. Revenue increased 10% in both equipment and services. Service revenue grew in all 3 segments, while continued momentum in Electrification and Power drove higher equipment revenue. In addition, price remained positive across all 3 segments. Adjusted EBITDA continued to reflect higher, more profitable volume, price and productivity in the quarter. On an organic basis, Electrification realized nearly 700 basis points of margin expansion and Power margins expanded more than 200 basis points. This margin strength was offset by Wind, primarily due to higher contract losses at offshore. We delivered nearly $1 billion of positive free cash flow improving $900 million year-over-year, primarily driven by stronger working capital management. Working capital was an approximately $600 million benefit in the quarter improving over $500 million year-over-year, mainly due to improved linearity which includes more closely aligning the timing of disbursements and collections. Our cash balance also reflects the monetization of a 16% ownership stake in our electrification joint venture in India which generated approximately $700 million of pre-tax proceeds classified as financing cash flows with no impact to adjusted EBITDA. We executed this transaction as a part of our ongoing process to simplify entity shareholding structures as well as to capitalize on strong equity valuations in India, while remaining the majority shareholder in this business, serving an attractive market. Combined with our third quarter free cash flow, these proceeds increased our already solid cash balance to $7.4 billion. We're encouraged by our year-to-date financial performance with solid revenue growth led by services which increased 9% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of over 200 basis points and more than $1.1 billion of positive free cash flow generation, a year-over-year improvement of over $2 billion. Our backlog growth in both services and equipment provides an excellent foundation for continued strong financial performance. Turning to Power on Slide 7. The segment delivered another strong quarter with continued double-digit orders growth, increasing revenue and further EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 34%, led by higher equipment and services at Gas Power. Gas Power equipment orders increased 40% as we booked 9 HA units in the quarter which exceeded the total number of HAs booked in all of 2023. We also booked 15 aeroderivative units in the quarter, almost doubling units ordered in the third quarter of last year. Power services orders were up 29% due to higher demand from outages and upgrades. The robust demand for gas equipment and services is driving further growth in our backlog. Based upon the backlog, we're funding capacity expansion from customer orders and related down payments to enable delivery of 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines annually starting in 2026. Revenue grew 13%, driven by Gas Power. Services increased mainly from higher outage volume as well as price. Equipment revenue reflected growth in HA gas turbine deliveries. EBITDA increased 45%, resulting in 240 basis points of margin expansion as higher volume, productivity and price more than offset the impact of inflation. We're using lean to drive better operational execution and productivity which is improving equipment profitability. For example, the heavy-duty gas turbine team enhanced standard work from underwriting to execution through a series of kaizens. This work has resulted in a 20% improvement in quality control so far this year, generating productivity and margin expansion. We continue to leverage lean to drive better financial results and better outcomes for our customers. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect gas equipment orders to accelerate. We anticipate higher HA deliveries and services revenue to be offset by lower aeroderivative deliveries, resulting in relatively flat revenue, EBITDA and margin compared to a strong 4Q '23. We also expect continued productivity to offset inflation. At Wind, onshore delivered its most profitable results in 12 quarters, while we incurred additional offshore contract losses related to the impacts of recent blade events and expected project execution delays. Wind orders declined 19% due to lower onshore equipment orders outside of North America as we remain selective about the markets we serve. In offshore, we remain focused on executing our existing challenged backlog. Revenue decreased slightly in the quarter. In offshore, the impact of execution delays resulted in lower revenue, partially offset by a settlement of approximately $500 million for a previously cancelled offshore project. In onshore, revenue grew due to higher North America equipment and services despite lower volume outside of North America. EBITDA margins contracted 410 basis points versus the prior year. In offshore, the impact of the approximately $700 million charge for additional contract losses was partially offset by the $300 million gain from the offshore project cancellation settlement. In onshore, margins expanded from positive price and favorable equipment mix. Onshore delivered better results despite higher services costs as we're deploying more crews and cranes to continue improving fleet availability. Overall, we're focused on driving better quality, cost and execution productivity across wind. As discussed, we remain cautious on the timing of an onshore order inflection in North America as customers navigate growing interconnection queues. We do expect the Wind segment to grow revenue and EBITDA substantially in the fourth quarter as we deliver more higher-margin onshore equipment volume out of existing backlog. As a result, wind should be modestly profitable in the quarter given stronger onshore results. Turning to Electrification on Slide 9. We had another quarter of robust demand, significant revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 17%, driven by the increasing need for grid equipment. Within Grid Solutions orders remained strong in the U.S., particularly for switchgears. In addition, electrification services orders grew 23%. Revenue increased 24%, driven by Grid Solutions with meaningful growth in switchgears and transformers and by power conversion. EBITDA margin expanded nearly 700 basis points on strong volume with continued price and productivity. The segment achieved its first quarter of double-digit EBITDA margins with all electrification businesses expanding margins in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand and price resulting in electrification revenue growth and substantial EBITDA margin expansion. Equipment orders are outpacing revenue, further expanding the equipment backlog to approximately $19 billion, up almost $6 billion compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate further equipment backlog growth driven by continued order strength at healthy margins. Revenue should increase year-over-year but at a more modest rate relative to year-to-date performance, given the comparably strong revenue in 4Q '23. We expect continued margin expansion from higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity. Turning to Slide 10 to discuss guidance. While I touched on the fourth quarter for the segments, for GE Vernova overall, we expect solid year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from higher, more profitable volume pricing and productivity despite losses at offshore. We expect fourth quarter free cash flow to be lower year-over-year as quarterly cash linearity improves. Given we booked our largest onshore order in 4Q last year, the SunZia Wind project, we also expect lower down payments. In addition, we anticipate higher taxes as a result of our EBITDA growth along with higher CapEx, primarily to support future capacity expansion in Gas Power and Electrification. For the full year, we're reaffirming our 2024 GE Vernova guidance as stronger performance in Power and Electrification is offsetting additional losses at Wind. We continue to expect revenue towards the high end of $34 billion to $35 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 5% to 7% and free cash flow to be between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion but trending towards the higher end of the range. By segment, in Power, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with EBITDA margin expansion at the higher end of 150 to 200 basis points from services strength and productivity. At Wind, we still anticipate revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year. Positive price, productivity and cost savings in onshore are expected to partially mitigate losses in offshore. As a result, we expect segment EBITDA to move closer to profitability, improving nearly 50% compared to the $1 billion loss in 2023. In Electrification, we now expect high-teens revenue growth, giving us increased confidence in achieving the upper end of high single-digit EBITDA margins for the year. We're very encouraged by the growing strength we're seeing at Power and Electrification and we're taking steps necessary to deliver better financial results at Wind. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet and we're growing our cash balance. We look forward to providing you with details on our multiyear financial outlook and capital allocation strategy at our December 10 meeting. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. We are pleased with our performance so far this year and excited about our future as we help our customers electrify and decarbonize the world. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi-decade growth for GE Vernova and continue creating value for our stakeholders. Specifically, our Power segment generates approximately 70% of its revenue from services and we expect this segment to deliver continued margin expansion with growing free cash flow for a number of years. We expect to continue expanding margins in onshore wind and we are vigorously addressing the challenges in offshore wind. In Electrification, we are seeing customers significantly increase grid-related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero-carbon power sources. We expect this segment to also deliver higher margins in the years to come. As we execute on our strategy, our lean operating system, commitment to sustainability and innovation remain at the core of our company. We are running our businesses better and are well positioned as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow over the coming years. And when we put all this together, we see a clear opportunity to deliver substantial value for our stakeholders going forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of our call.
Michael Lapides: Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Please return to the queue if you have follow-ups. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Maybe just a first question, circling back on offshore as there was clearly a lot of news there in September. Maybe just remind us kind of as you look today, how you're thinking about the pace of that $3 billion of offshore backlog being worked down? And then there was a good update on the turbine blade issues in North America. Maybe just anything on what's going on with the U.K. project, please?
Scott Strazik: You bet, Julian. I mean it's a start. Clearly, the last 4 months for offshore wind have been difficult for us. I mean the delayed project execution has cost us time on when we had previously talked about completing the backlog we have to go which previously we had said we'd be largely complete by the end of 2025. In light of what we've kind of been managing through the last 4 months, that's moving to the right but we're also at a period of time where we're evaluating alternatives, things like incremental vessels, things like that, that can increase the pace and we're committed to kind of giving you transparency to the burn down of the approximately $3 billion backlog we have left to go when we get together on December 10, as we outline our both '25 financial objectives and our long-range financial targets associated with that. On the blade piece of the equation, just going right there, we've been very intentional and focused on this since the event in July. We can tell you today that the root cause was what we framed up in July. There was a manufacturing deviation at one of our factories in Canada. We have been very systematically reviewing all of our blades in offshore wind and we can say today that a very small proportion, low single-digit proportion of our manufactured blades in totality also had a manufacturing deviation similar to the blade that we experienced the failure in Vineyard Wind. In those cases, we're taking action on those blades and we're doing that right now and really now getting to a point of shifting back to execution out at sea. To your question on Dogger Bank, we're fully in installation and commissioning in Dogger Bank today. In the case of Vineyard, we have been installing both towers and the cells and just got guidance to start to begin reinstalling blades at Vineyard yesterday. So I think this blade chapter, we've learned a lot from the last 3 to 4 months. And now this is back to project execution and we'll give you more on the burn down of the $3 billion to go on December 10.
Ken Parks: And Julian, I would just add where we are, it's important to understand that as we've taken that $700 million charge, we've taken into account all of the things that Scott has outlined. So in other words, we know that there's cost for blade remediation. There's also this extension of the delivery time line which we have some current estimates at but we'll continue to work through it, both on how it may impact the Vineyard Wind project as well as the Dogger Bank project. So the important thing to consider is, we've done a lot of work. The teams have done some outstanding work to make sure that we're staying ahead of this with the customers and making sure we're delivering on our commitments there. But we have attempted our best effort in those charges to encapsulate all the costs that's going to come along with that. So the numbers that we give you are as clean as they can be as far as what it takes to deliver.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.
Nicole DeBlase: Maybe I could ask a question on power. I think you guys said that you expect power equipment orders to accelerate in the fourth quarter. I guess can you talk a little bit about what you're hearing from customers to provide confidence in that outcome?
Scott Strazik: You bet, Nicole. I mean, I'll hit on it. And although the power orders in the third quarter were up 34% and as we said in our prepared remarks, for gas, as an example, we've taken 14 gigawatts of new orders 3Q year-to-date which is twice those equivalent levels in the first 3 quarters of last year. When we look at the pipeline coming from here, we do expect our fourth quarter to be our strongest quarter of 2024. And although it's early and we'll firm this up before December 10, we see the 2025 orders looking very similar to 2024, if not modestly stronger but probably with a larger tilt towards North America. The reality is the orders that we booked this year have been -- had a heavy proportion of Middle East orders. We announced a large order in Japan in the third quarter. U.S. is part of the equation but as we've been saying for quite some time, we see North America and we see the hyperscaler dynamic being more of a '25 dynamic than '24 and that's exactly how we think this is going to still play out sitting here today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Percoco: I want to stick with power for a second. This is a little bit of a higher level question. But clearly, you're seeing a lot of demand, particularly in gas. And if you kind of look back to the early 2000s and 2010s, I mean your power business was a high-teens, low-20s EBITDA margin business. And I'm just kind of curious now that we're entering this next wave of growth in gas, is the current pricing environment supportive of you getting back to that margin structure or is there anything structurally different kind of this time around that might impede your ability to get back there?
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Andrew. I mean, at the start, candidly, we have a much larger services business today than what we would have had at that comparison point because we've been growing the fleet all of these years since then. So at the start, we've got an incredible services annuity stream that's going to sustain itself for a long time. The composition of what's going to play out the second half of this decade relative to early in the 2000s is different in the sense that it's still going to be less gas turbines but the gigawatt or the megawatts really per gas turbine are going to be substantially larger, right, now that we're shifting towards the HA profile. We are seeing substantially better pricing environment today than -- what we're getting in orders today relative to what we're shipping in revenue today. And that will start to benefit us really in, to a large extent, the second half of '26 and the full year of '27 in revenue on what I'd call today's new pricing environment. And when you combine those 2 things together with a much larger services business, a customer sentiment that's investing in that gas fleet substantially more today than certainly have the prior 10 years and that equipment profile that you're citing with better pricing, we have a lot of confidence that throughout the better part of this decade, we're going to keep expanding margins and look forward to giving you really a new definition of what that should look like by 2028 at our December 10 Analyst Day.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Scott, so when we met a few months ago, we were talking about a gas power equipment market of, call it, roughly, I don't know, 35 gigawatts by 2028. And it seems like that market has basically effectively doubled overnight. And so the real question I have longer term, as you kind of think about the next few years, is this the new run rate for that business from an order perspective? And then specifically, as it relates to capacity, we know you're increasing your own capacity. Any update that you can give us from the supply chain on their ability to meet faster growth in the next few years?
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Joe. I'd say the orders level that we're seeing for 2024 which, again, as I said before, 14 gigawatts, 3Q year-to-date, twice where we were last year and the fourth quarter should be our strongest quarter. When we package that for '24 and then look at 2025, at minimum based on the visibility we have there, we see 2025 being at equivalent or modestly better orders levels than 2024. And that we can clearly see in front of us and are very comfortable articulating. There is a healthy back -- pipeline beyond that, that we'll work. But we can say that with quite a bit of definition for '24 and '25 that very quickly by the time you get into the first quarter of next year, we're really going to be focused on filling slots primarily in 2028. And that is at that level of 70 to 80 gas turbines per year probably on the lower end in '26, the higher end beyond that because the capacity starts to cut in, in the middle of '26. We don't necessarily see today going materially higher than that 80 number that we've talked about most recently but we're looking at tactical ways to go modestly above that if and when it makes sense. But it's not likely to be another material shift to the extent today's run rate of 55 gas turbines a year, we've now secured capacity to 80, that took us 6 months working with the supply chain to secure. And we're really just continuing to firm that up and make tactical adjustments. No major headlines beyond the updates we've given recently on that.
Ken Parks: Yes. And I think one of the other things to consider as you're thinking about how does that impact us from an investment perspective as we're thinking about building out for this capacity. One of the nice things about the cycle that we're operating in, as you know, is that as we take orders and orders are coming in nicely, those come along with down payments. And we've been pretty clear and Scott said along the way and I think we even said it in the last quarter call that as we're thinking about making investments and we're making these investments for this, growing from 55 units a year to, call it, 70 to 80, we're really funding that with customer orders, right? So customers are coming in, they're making down payments and so the draw on capital really comes directly from the orders that we're taking. And I think that's a really important thing to kind of build into your thinking around how we, as a management team, are making very disciplined decisions around those investment levels.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just pivoting slightly differently within power. As you think about the BWX [ph] opportunity here in GEH, how would you frame SMRs as a proportion of the overall growth trajectory? How would you frame kind of any initial expectations on awards here? Would love to hear the new framing.
Scott Strazik: You bet. I mean I think when we get to nuclear, we really have to start with the existing installed base we have. I mean, in the U.S., as an example, we have 65 plants today with our equipment. And as an illustration, we see at least 3 gigawatts of incremental nuclear capacity we can add with upgrades of the existing installed base that we have and another couple of gigawatts that could get added from restarting plants that aren't running today. So -- and I give that context to just say, in the case of nuclear and with the surge in demand cycle of nuclear that's likely to trickle through to our financials sooner than small modular reactor. We can see orders playing out middle of the decade in that regard that cut into revenue late in the decade. On small modular reactor, sentiment in commercial activity is continuing to accelerate here. The tone of the conversation is also shifting a little bit even in the context of the summer, really, where more discussions are taking place right now with existing nuclear plants that have the security infrastructure within it to add small modular reactors to the security apparatus that already exists with existing plants. That has been a more dynamic conversation the last 90 days than when we were together at the July earnings call. And I think there will be activity there that's going to continue to move forward at a new build that follows. For us, ultimately, this comes back to the first 300-megawatt block of power getting commissioned in Canada in 2029. We don't see that moving to the left. 2029 really is the start. And then from a revenue perspective and really a U.S. new capacity growth perspective, we're really excited about what SMR can mean for us. But it's not going to financially become a meaningful part of our income statement with revenue and growth until early into the next decade. And those activities and those discussions are very healthy right now. But I think it's important to contextualize when it's really going to translate to the financials and it is going to take until then before it becomes a material part of our future growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Just to follow-up on JDS' question. It seems that the customer profile, particularly on the nuclear side is changing. We see a lot of headlines about hyperscalers sort of trying to get their own expertise in running these assets. Can you just talk about how the channel is evolving? And are you disadvantaged in any way, shape or form? Because I can see how on gas turbines your traditional customers coming back is a big positive. But these customers do not necessarily have experience with GE, you don't necessarily have a reputation with them. How do you sort of get your fair share on this new class of customers across gas and nuclear?
Scott Strazik: Yes. I would say on nuclear, Andrew, going back to that, I mean, when I think about COP28 last year in Dubai and thinking about 22 heads of state talking about tripling the nuclear capacity in the world by 2050, it's going to be in all the above dynamic with new nuclear add. There's going to be large conventional blocks of power added. There's going to be multiple small modular reactor technologies that are going to be part of the equation. We're really excited about the sentiment shift back towards nuclear and have an incredible amount of confidence in our ability to serve that growing market. To be clear, a lot of the market sentiment with, call it, new archetype of customers that are interested in nuclear power, are going to ultimately, in most cases, still have a traditional nuclear operator running those plants. And those traditional nuclear operators are the bread and butter customers that we have thrived with for decades. The commercial arrangements of exactly how that works between us to those operators of the assets and their commercial arrangement with the end customers, that's a lot of what's materializing and firming up and will take some more time to unfold. And that's a applicable statement for both gas and nuclear. But in both cases, I really like our chances to play a meaningful role serving that growing market. And especially with nuclear, what I would keep emphasizing is, this is about established technology and time to market. And our BWRX is using established fuel, established combustion chamber technology that gives us a high degree of confidence that we're going to cut in our first 300-megawatt block of power in 2029. And as we're into construction on that first project in Canada next year, we have a lot of customer sentiment that's following that progress and more commercial activity will follow.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andrew Kaplowitz: Maybe just on onshore wind. I think you said that you can maintain a high single-digit margin on flat revenue but you're still a little conservative on when a new order infection might be. At this point, the understanding that you'll update us again in December, could you sustain the kind of performance you had in onshore? Or when do you kind of need an inflection in onshore wind bookings to support the business?
Scott Strazik: Well, Andy, we see much like we've had flat revenue in '24 relative to '23. When we sit here today, we see flat revenue also in 2025 but with improved profitability in onshore wind and generally a similar looking revenue profile. And that's just the ability to continue to -- we've been remixing the profitability of the backlog and you started to see that in the third quarter with the most profitable quarter we've had in 3 years and you'll see that even more so in the fourth quarter, into next year. We don't need "orders inflection" to sustain that performance. I don't have a lot of apprehension that the top line level that we're at today is at risk of going lower, as an example. So by default, I would think of this very much as a floor kind of the escape, the second half performance of 2024 into 2025 on what onshore wind is. For us in a business that is very North America dependent and let's contextualize where we are in North America. We're going to ultimately COD [ph] in the industry this year, mid- to high single-digit gigawatts of new onshore wind. There's a lot of people that believe that number needs to be 15 to 20 gigawatts a year for us to reach our objectives. Where I'm cautious and have been consistently cautious is, when we see the orders come that start to get us back to the U.S. commissioning double-digit mid-teens gigawatts of orders. Now when we do, that volume leverage that we're going to yield on onshore wind is going to lead to a much more profitable business that we're all going to like a lot more. I'm just not ready to call a date on when that comes because we just don't quite see that now, although all indications say the U.S. does need that later in the decade. But I don't want you to take my comments to be one that we're concerned that it's going to go backwards. We feel like we're at a solid foundational level with onshore wind performance that will get better with top line growth. We're just not ready to call that top line growth yet.
Ken Parks: Yes. And I think that -- to repeat something that we've kind of said in the last couple of calls, the wind team and specifically the onshore wind team, Vic and team have been working really hard to take cost out of that business to make sure it is as efficient as it can be. And in doing so, kind of running to what Scott said, to put some numbers around it, they've resized the business to be profitable at about 1,000 turbines a year. We're obviously running at a higher rate than that. So I just say that because to kind of respond to your question around when do we need the wind orders to turn in order to see an inflection in this business. We're already starting to see that inflection in profitability based upon cost management. Plus, I'll remind you that as we came into the year, we talked about an onshore wind backlog that had about 10 incremental points of margin in that backlog. That's really what's giving us confidence in the second half of this year to see the profitability improvement that we're seeing now which does set us up for the carry-on point. I won't necessarily say a jumping off point for incremental growth because pricing has kind of stabilized at these better levels. But to be able to carry us through and then when that inflection comes, we are, because of the hard work of everybody in the business, in a really good place to benefit from it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: So, I want to go back to the comment about the power equipment orders in 2025 and kind of shifting more towards the U.S. with the hyperscalers. As you are progressing with these conversations with the hyperscalers, are you seeing any commonality in the mix of product type that they are interested in as far as kind of aero versus H-class? And then can you remind us, is there any kind of meaningful difference between the 2 as far as kind of lead times or financial profile, anything like that?
Scott Strazik: You bet, Mark. Thanks for the question. And I do think this goes back -- if I start, I would just say the trend is definitely shifting more towards HA gas turbine discussions with consistency than aeroderivative. That's because the hyperscalers are evolving from single data centers dependent on 60 to 100 megawatts to starting to look at data center parks in which you can start to think about multiple gigawatt size data center parks that support a number of data centers in 1 location. So there is a very healthy shift towards what maybe a few years ago, we would have been talking to these customers about aeroderivative applications in Ireland that were backup power for the grid to now this being baseload power with HA gas turbines at the exact time that our HA product line is set to thrive. And just to emphasize a few points there. I mean we have almost 60 gigawatts of HA gas turbines commissioned today. We have over 100 running. We have -- or approaching 3 million operating hours with our HA gas turbines. And for us, this is what is so exciting to us about this part of the orders book because when you start to look into that orders profile for 2025, that we do project to be more U.S.-centric, similar in size to '24, maybe modestly better than 2024 orders level, you're seeing very good equipment economics but then you're also adding more baseload machines that are going to run a substantial amount of the year. So the services calories for us on this equipment opportunity in the life cycle economics are just especially good because you've got the capacity adds and the services calories over the long term that we're really excited about. And that's all part of why with confidence we could make the announcement we did in September that we are adding more capacity for gas from the 55 to the 70 to 80 a year because the life cycle economics are so compelling. And frankly, the payback was so attractive because you've got the equipment margin to keep the payback quite tight but these are going to run at a baseload level for a very long time.
Operator: This question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets.
Chris Dendrinos: Yes. I appreciate you squeezing me in here. I guess I wanted to hit on electrification here. And I guess, specifically, order demand continues to build. We've heard that the HVDC market could have a backlog out into 2030. So the question is, do you have the capacity to support the demand in electrification? And then on top of that, are you continuing to push prices higher quarter-on-quarter, or is that kind of levelled off here?
Scott Strazik: Chris, I appreciate the question. I mean there's a lot -- just to reframe this for a moment. I mean there's just a lot to be excited about with electrification today. I mean you cited what we've been talking about which is the backlog will be more than triple what it was in the beginning of '23 by the end of the year. We are continuing to see price in today's environment. So we don't feel like we've topped out there in a way that Ken mentioned earlier, where in onshore wind, as an example, that's really levelled off, we're not there today in electrification. Part of why in our prepared remarks, we are intentional to talk about things like the electrification, the transmission business is -- the power transmission business is, we've worked hard over the first 9 months of the year to get to a point that we have a high degree of confidence that we're going to double the capacity of that business and 75% of the capacity is just coming with managing the assets better, managing labor better, adding shifts that doesn't really require CapEx. There's about 25% of the growth to double that does require CapEx, that's site expansion. So we use that illustration to just say it would be a lot harder for us to meet this growing demand if we were doing with greenfield operations. That's not what's happening here. The reality is, I've been around these businesses for a while and broadly the -- call it, energy businesses for a while. And for a big part of that period of time, we had overcapacity in an industrial footprint that was a financial drag. That same industrial footprint, most explicitly in electrification, is now a catalyst that allows us to drive towards growth more capital efficiently and time efficiently than others because we're using existing footprint that has the factory, that has the connection to the railroads, that has the electricity source already. And that's, frankly, where we're seeing the electrification business continue to fulfill faster than we thought. I mean you saw 24% revenue growth in the third quarter, it's because they're continuing to make real progress here executing on their backlog a bit faster than we anticipated when the year started. And now we need to work our way through a budget process in November and share that with you on what it looks like for 2025 but we're excited about that trend. So that's a long-winded context or explanation to say, yes, the backlog is up substantially but we have a lot of industrial assets that we're demonstrating ability to manage very efficiently that's going to allow us to grow into this in a very attractive way.
Ken Parks: And I think that to put a little bit of color on it from a regional perspective that we're excited about is the fact that while the European business has historically and continues to be, in our electrification business, the biggest individual piece of it, what we're seeing is that those growth rates that we saw step up last year with some of the large HVDC orders, while the compares get tougher year-over-year, the order comparisons are good. We're still staying at a good level, not just on HVDC but the other products in the portfolio. But what's really important is, not only is it a dynamic that's driving our business for Europe but the fastest-growing part of our electrification business based upon comps is really in North America. And we're excited about both of those things, both Europe and North America because they will provide multiyear tailwinds for us to continue to see this business grow and expand, as Scott outlined.
Michael Lapides: Operator, before we wrap up, let me turn it back to Scott for closing comments.
Scott Strazik: Michael, thank you. Everyone, we're excited about the trajectory of our company. We look forward to talking with many of you in the coming months. At the wrap, as I often do, I do want to thank our employees, our partners for their dedication and their hard work and our customers for their continued trust in us. And thank you for your continued investment interest in GE Vernova. We're looking forward to the months to come. We're in the early innings of a really exciting journey together and really looking forward to having everybody together on December 10 for our analyst meeting. So thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-25 07:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to GE Vernova's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference Michael Lapides, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\
Michael Lapides: Thank you, operator. Welcome to GE Vernova's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Scott Strazik and CFO, Ken Parks. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's Form 10-Q, the press release and in the presentation slides all of which are available on our website. Please note that year-over-year commentary or variances on orders, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and margin discussed during our prepared remarks are on an organic basis. We will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we do not undertake any obligation to do so. As described in our SEC filings actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. With that, I'll hand the call over to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We delivered strong results in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion across all three segments and substantial improvement in free cash flow. Macro trends are continuing to create meaningful opportunities for us to lead in the energy transition. First, we're seeing increasing demand for power generation driven by manufacturing growth, industrial electrification, EVs and emerging data center needs. Second, there is a significant need for grid infrastructure investments to support both energy security and reliability goals. And third, our customers are investing to decarbonize their power systems, which drives demand for low and zero-carbon generation as well as new grid connections. We're serving this robust market demand while simultaneously running our businesses better, driving disciplined growth, margin expansion and higher free cash flow. Turning to slide 4. I'll spend a few minutes on each of our segments. Our Power segment led by Gas Power delivered growth in both equipment and high-margin services orders and revenue, while also achieving 180 basis points of margin expansion. Power orders increased 30% this quarter led by strength in equipment orders which more than doubled year-over-year. Notably we recently commissioned our 100th HA gas turbine in South Korea. The H-class fleet is an important source of growing services revenue and billings for our Power segment. In the second half of this year, we expect continued strength in orders with heavy-duty gas turbines including HA units to be higher versus first half 2024. Electrification is our fastest-growing segment. Profitable growth continues as customers modernize and invest in new products such as transformers and switch gears that are key to ensuring a reliable electricity system and connecting new generation sources. For example, orders more than doubled this quarter in North America which continues to be a key growth opportunity for this segment. Overall, the Electrification segment has grown its backlog by over 25% since the start of the year. I'm pleased with the team's progress on margins which expanded 360 basis points this quarter and I have conviction we can drive significant margin expansion given the electrification segment's strong demand and strong industry pricing dynamics. We are thoughtfully investing to increase our output levels for this rising demand. For example, we are almost doubling capacity our Stafford facility in the UK to deliver HVDC transformers. Right now, Wind remains the most challenging segment. While we grew onshore backlog in the quarter we remain cautious on the timing of an inflection in onshore orders as customers navigate the challenges that come with permitting new projects and higher interest rates. We are nearly two years into our Onshore Wind quality improvement program and we are making progress with no new significant issues identified. We continue to look for ways to implement the improvements into our existing fleet at a faster pace. In order to deliver for customers, we are adding crews to the field and gaining access to more cranes to accelerate our work. For our new units, we are leveraging technologies including our blade inspection robot to enhance our manufacturing process. At Offshore, we have converted almost $800 million of our backlog to revenue in the first half of the year. Last week, we had a turbine blade event at our Vineyard Wind project. The turbine was shut down safely and no one was injured. With safety always as a top priority, we are working with our customer and the appropriate agencies to determine the root cause and then implement corrective actions and a restart plan. While we continue to work to finalize our root cause analysis, our investigation to date indicates that the affected blade experience a manufacturing deviation. We have not identified information indicating an engineering design flaw in the blade or information of a connection with the blade event we experienced in an Offshore Wind project in the U.K., which was caused by an installation error out at sea. We are working with urgency to scrutinize our operations across Offshore Wind. Pace matters here, but we are going to be thorough instead of rushed. Going forward, we remain highly selective on potential offshore win new orders, focused on achieving substantially higher pricing, and disciplined commercial terms. In the Wind segment overall this quarter, we expanded margins by 400 basis points and see opportunities for further expansion. We still expect the Wind segment to approach profitability this year and become profitable in 2025. Longer term, wind should play a critical role in the energy transition. Now, over to the right side of the page. We are driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery, and cost. On safety, after 10 consecutive months of fatality-free operations, June was a tough month for us. An employee of ours in Malaysia lost his life driving to a work site in his personal car and a one car accident on a public road and a contractor working in our direction in Turkey lost his life with an arc flash event at a wind farm. Safety will always be the top priority at GE Vernova in both events reinforce our need to continue to get better to ensure our employees and contractors return home at the end of work. Turning to Quality, where we are always working to improve our outcomes for our customers. For example in a year where gas outages increased double-digits, our team has reduced quality deviations by 15% from live outage, our lean-enabled digital outage platform that reduces cycle-times and improve the field execution experience for our customers. We are also using lean to improve delivery. In Electrification, the team in France recently executed a series of Kaizens tackling material flow, scheduling, and increasing capacity. As a result of the new processes we implemented, one of the production cells increased its output of certain switchgear components by 135% from 17 per week to more than 40 per week, helping to drive the growth we are seeing in our electrification segment and ultimately, improving outcomes for our customers. Finally, we are using lean to simplify our operations and reduce G&A costs. We are focusing on reducing our G&A and driving productivity at our corporate center and in our segments. We began executing cost-out initiatives in the second quarter that give me increased confidence in our ability to realize G&A reductions in 2025. Turning to the next slide for a look into our strong second quarter financial performance. Orders were robust with 2Q 2024 marking the second largest order quarter we've delivered over the last three years and we saw healthy equipment backlog growth across multiple businesses, especially in Gas Power and Grid. We delivered disciplined top line growth led by the strength in price and services volume. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points with expansion across all segments. Notably, we generated positive free cash flow with an over $1 billion improvement year-over-year as well as sequentially and ended the second quarter with a $5.8 billion cash balance. We are raising our 2024 guidance and now expect revenue to trend towards the higher end of our $34 billion to $35 billion range largely on Electrification. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be 5% to 7%, up from previous expectations of the higher end of mid-single digits. The improvement is driven by Power, which we now expect will deliver 150 to 200 basis points of organic margin expansion and Electrification where we expect high single-digit margins. We are also raising our 2024 free cash flow guidance. We expect to deliver between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion up from the prior $700 million to $1.1 billion range. Overall, with continued demand growth further margin expansion and strong free cash flow, we feel confident about the momentum in our business for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Ken for more details on our second quarter performance and our latest guidance.
Ken Parks: Thanks, Scott. Let's turn to Slide 6. As already stated, we delivered strong results in the second quarter with EBITDA margin expansion across all three segments and positive free cash flow generation. Demand remains robust as orders reached nearly $12 billion which Scott mentioned was our second largest orders quarter in the last three years, and approximately 1.4x second quarter revenue. Power equipment orders more than doubled and total services orders grew double-digits with strength in Power and Electrification. Due to large Offshore Wind and HVDC equipment orders booked in the second quarter of last year, orders were 7% lower year-over-year. Our backlog remains sizable at $115 billion, including the impact of the recently completed divestiture of a portion of steam power to EDF. Importantly, equipment margin and backlog remains healthy in line with our disciplined profitable growth priority. Revenue grew 2% with continued strength in electrification and power, partially offset by Wind. Services revenue remained solid, increasing 9% with growth across all segments. In addition, all three segments benefited from positive price again this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 85% driving 320 basis points of margin expansion. All segments delivered more than 150 basis points of expansion in the quarter. Margin expansion was driven by productivity, price and services volume which more than offset inflationary impacts. In addition, we continue to benefit from our previously announced restructuring actions largely at Wind and Power. We delivered over $800 million of positive free cash flow improving more than $1 billion both sequentially and year-over-year from working capital and higher adjusted EBITDA partially offset by higher cash taxes. Working capital was an approximately $760 million benefit in the quarter, improving over $700 million year-over-year due primarily to strong collections. In the quarter, we received an approximately $300 million refund resulting from a positive arbitration decision in an open multiemployer pension plan dispute which is included in free cash flow. The P&L benefit of approximately $250 million was recorded in SG&A and was excluded from adjusted SG&A and adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as a result of completing the sale of a portion of steam power, we received approximately $600 million of net proceeds, which are classified outside of free cash flow and recognized an almost $900 million pre-tax gain in the quarter which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The combination of free cash flow generation and proceeds from divestitures increased our already solid cash balance to $5.8 billion. Overall, we're encouraged by our financial performance in the first half of 2024 with organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of nearly 400 basis points and positive free cash flow generation. Now turning to Power on slide 7. The segment delivered another strong quarter with double-digit orders growth, solid revenue growth and further EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 30%, led by higher equipment at Gas Power and Hydro power. During the second quarter, Gas Power equipment orders increased over 60% as we booked 14 heavy-duty gas turbines, which included four HA units compared to no HA unit bookings in 2023 second quarter. Power Services orders grew 12%, driven by Gas Power. Revenue grew 10% on higher gas service volumes. Equipment revenue also increased from Gas Power strength. EBITDA increased 24%, resulting in 180 basis points of margin expansion as higher services volume, productivity and price more than offset the impact of inflation. Looking ahead, we see increased demand for gas as a reliable source of baseload generation, which is resulting in incremental growth opportunities for both Gas equipment and Gas services over the medium to long-term. We anticipate additional 2024 CapEx at power to fulfill demand on gas orders that are already booked, and we continue to evaluate strategies to meet potential additional demand acceleration. Turning to Wind, we continued making progress in driving improved EBITDA despite lower revenue levels. Orders declined 44%, given the tough comparison to the second quarter of last year, when a large offshore equipment order was booked. As a reminder, that offshore order was later canceled by the customer in the fourth quarter of 2023. Onshore equipment orders declined 11%, but increased more than 2.5 times sequentially from the first quarter. As Scott indicated earlier, we remain cautious on the timing of an onshore order inflection in North America as customers navigate growing interconnection queues and higher interest rates. Revenue decreased 20% from lower onshore equipment deliveries, partially offset by higher offshore revenue as we continue to execute on our offshore equipment backlog. EBITDA margins improved 400 basis points versus the prior year from positive price and continued cost reductions. At offshore, EBITDA losses decreased, and onshore margins improved despite lower volume, remaining profitable again in the second quarter. Wind is demonstrating signs of financial progress. We continue our work at both onshore and offshore to drive incremental cost leverage. In the second half of 2024, we expect to further improve EBITDA on meaningfully higher onshore equipment volume at better margins, which are currently in our existing backlog. Now at electrification, we had another strong quarter of revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders were $4.8 billion, roughly 2.7 times second quarter revenue and over 30% higher sequentially. While remaining strong, second quarter orders declined year-over-year due to significantly higher HVDC orders recorded in the prior year. Within Grid Solutions, we saw strong orders growth in the US, particularly for high-voltage switchgears and circuit breakers. Revenue grew 19% with strength in equipment led by Grid Solutions and Power Conversion. EBITDA margin expanded 360 basis points on volume, price and productivity. All of our electrification businesses were profitable in the second quarter, and expanded margins both year over year and sequentially. We continue to see strong demand and price resulting in electrification revenue growth and meaningful EBITDA margin expansion. Equipment backlog in this segment increased to approximately $17 billion, up $5 billion compared to the second quarter of 2023, with healthy margins. Turning to slide 10. Largely based upon our strong first half performance, we're raising our full year 2024 guidance. For revenue, we're now trending towards the high end of our original $34 billion to $35 billion guidance range, mostly due to additional Electrification strength. We're also increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of 5% to 7%. By segment, we maintain our power revenue guidance, but now anticipate approximately 150 to 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion compared to our previous guide of approximately 100 basis points driven mainly by Gas Power strength. At Wind, we still expect revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year and to approach profitability this year from positive price productivity and cost savings. In the second half the timing of turbine shipments as well as cost could drive some variability in wind results. In Electrification, we're increasing our revenue growth guidance from low double digits to mid- to high teens based on continued strong demand and favorable price. Given our higher revenue growth expectations we now expect electrification to achieve high single-digit EBITDA margins in 2024 compared to our previous expectation of mid-single digits. As a result of the higher EBITDA outlook along with the strong cash performance and the nonrecurring arbitration refund in the first half of 2024 we're also increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. This includes slightly higher expected CapEx investments primarily to fulfill significant gas power orders booked so far this year. Looking specifically at the third quarter we expect solid year-over-year revenue growth and continued EBITDA margin expansion across the segments. Relative to last year's third quarter we anticipate power top line growth from higher gas equipment and services revenue and EBITDA margin expansion versus last year from volume productivity and pricing. Wind revenue is expected to grow meaningfully year-over-year as we deliver higher-margin onshore volume out of backlog. In addition EBITDA should improve from the higher onshore volume along with positive price and lower cost structure. At Electrification, we expect solid top line growth along with margin expansion from higher volume productivity and favorable pricing. In the third quarter note that like in most years the seasonality of outages and services revenue at Gas Power means lower adjusted EBITDA on a sequential basis for GE Vernova. We expect free cash flow to improve year-over-year driven by the stronger adjusted EBITDA. Sequentially, we anticipate free cash flow to decrease largely from the lower adjusted EBITDA slightly higher CapEx and cash taxes as well as the nonrecurring arbitration refund received in the second quarter. We're very encouraged by the momentum we built in the first half of the year. We're also confident in the strength of our balance sheet and remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating as we evaluate opportunities for growth and return of capital to shareholders. With that I'll turn it back to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. All in we are pleased with our performance in the first half of this year and we are excited about our future as we help our customers electrify and decarbonize the world. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi-decade growth for GE Vernova. Our Power segment generates 70% of its revenues from services. We expect power to drive expanded margins with growing free cash flow for a number of years. We expect to continue expanding margins in Wind and to benefit when demand for new Wind units especially in North America ramps further. In Electrification, we are seeing customers significantly increase grid-related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero carbon power sources. We expect this segment to also continue to deliver higher margins in the years to come. Our lean operating system sustainability and innovation remain at the core of our company. We are running our businesses better and are well positioned as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow over the coming years. And when we put all this together we see a clear opportunity to deliver substantial value for our stakeholders going forward. With that I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of the call.
Michael Lapides: Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Please return to the queue if you have follow-ups. With that, operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: Yes. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking our question. So I wanted to start with the Wind segment and just kind of the Vineyard Wind project that's been in the news. I appreciate you're taking your time, you're being thorough with a review here. Just for those on the line that haven't been through one of these before, can you just kind of talk about what that time line might be though? I mean should we be expecting this to be more kind of weeks or months or maybe even quarters? And then kind of the second question on that is. Is there any impact to your deliveries on the Dogger Bank project in Europe?
Scott Strazik: Mark, thanks for the question. It's been 11 days since the event. Just to reinforce at the start, we have no indications of an engineering design flaw that's important at the beginning. As we said in the prepared remarks, we have identified a material deviation or a manufacturing deviation in one of our factories that through the inspection or quality assurance process, we should have identified. Because of that, we're going to use our existing data and reinspect all of the blades that we have made for offshore wind and for context in this factory in Gaspé, Canada where the material deviation existed, we've made about 150 blades, so that gives you an indication and context of the work ahead. But to be clear, this is work we know how to do. I mean the industry uses non-destructive testing, think ultrasound, think a radiologist, but for a blade to identify deviations. We are going to go and do this on every blade, prudent thorough process. We're not going to talk about the time line today. We have work to do, but I have a high degree of confidence that we can do this, and we'll do it in support of both the customer and the agency and move forward from there. On your question on kind of deliveries and timing, I would just frame up a few things. I mean, clearly, while we're on pause right now, there's risk to some collections moving from 2024 into 2025. And that is embedded into our financial guidance here for what we framed up and we're really taking the path forward. Now, on Dogger Bank, we continue to install and commission wind turbines right now, and we intend to continue to do that. We're in close contact with SSC, and we continue to progress on that project today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.
Andy Kaplowitz: Good morning, Guys.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Andy.
Ken Parks: Good morning.
Andy Kaplowitz: Scott, so if I look at sort of the order environment and wind just out of curiosity, I know you reiterated the flat revenue guidance. But at what point does Wind have to pick up before you get into 2025 and it becomes a more difficult year. And are you still planning on sort of the high single-digit margin in onshore in the second half of 2024?
Scott Strazik: Yeah. We are. I mean, we're still consistent with our financial framing of approaching profitability in 2024 in the segment with high single-digit onshore wind margins in 2024 and the segment turning profitable in 2025, Andy. What I would just emphasize is we -- 2024 and 2025 as we've been framing up for a period of time are two more difficult years for us and win relative to the dynamics we have in the other segments. But we remain confident in that framework for 2024 and 2025. And then when you look at the orders pipeline that we see, it's just tough for us to call when it starts to convert into orders, we still see the possibility that we could see those orders come through in 2025 that leads to a revenue inflection point in 2026 on onshore at the exact same time that we'll still be materially through our Offshore Wind backlog. So 2024 and 2025 is going to be very consistent with what we've talked about. And then you're really playing through to 2026, where we see the real possibility for margins to accrete substantially as we have the potential for some Onshore Wind growth and Offshore Wind becomes a smaller proportion of the total revenue guide.
Ken Parks: Yeah. And the one thing I would add, I think it's the right question around thinking about 2025, but also remember that as we're moving through the second half of 2024, we called out an Onshore Wind in the backlog as of the end of 2023 that we had expanded our margin within that backlog by about 10 full points. Some of that will begin to deliver in 2024 in the second half, which gives us confidence in the statements that we made, and that Scott just reiterated about our outlook and approaching profitability for the year for Wind overall. But some of that accretion and backlog will deliver in 2025. So part of the step-up in 2025, as you asked about, will be incremental Wind orders coming in the second half. But a piece of that is already in our backlog and we will deliver on it as we move into the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets.
Chris Dendrinos: Yes. Good morning. I guess maybe just following up on part of that question there. Can you talk about some of the margins that are embedded in your order demand today and sort of where the, I guess, things are going forward specific maybe to Electrification and Power? Thanks.
Scott Strazik: Can you please repeat the question team? We're having an audio challenge here in the room?
Chris Dendrinos: Yes. I guess I was just following-up on the last question. You made some comments around the margins embedded in that Wind backlog. And I'm curious what the margin profile looks like for the backlog in Power and Electrification. I think you'd previously mentioned some strong pricing dynamics in both those segments. I'm kind of curious where things are at today?
Ken Parks: Yes. So we would tell you that in the -- let's start with the Wind, because I think it's important as we're also -- I gave you the 2023 number, what's happening as we move into 2024. We had seen Wind margin backlogs accrete and grow as, call it, the last 12 to 18 months as we move towards the end of 2023. What we're seeing in orders that we're taking in now is that better pricing is actually staying at kind of those levels as we move through the first half of the year. So, it's moved up and it's kind of staying at those levels. Now the difference is to where you asked about on Power and Electrification. As those demand patterns have continued to grow, what we've seen is the pricing environment has continued to get stronger versus where we ended 2023, both in Power and Electrification. And a point of reference is on Electrification, we had talked about for overall Electrification equipment at the end of 2023, our margins and backlog had expanded 5-full points. And so we're seeing that continue to grow as we move over time and any quarter point can have a little bit of volatility to it, but the pricing dynamic within Electrification continuing to get better, booking better, stronger profitable orders and backlog. And obviously, the same thing on the Power dynamics, as you see the really strong orders coming on to the books.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Hey, Good morning, guys.
Ken Parks: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: I want to focus my question on Gas Power equipment orders. And so year-to-date you guys have booked 9-gigawatts of orders, which is pretty incredible given where we were last year. Scott, how much of this do you think is the market expanding versus market share gains? And then also, your commentary around the HAs being -- having better order rates in the second half of the year. I'm just curious if you can maybe just talk about your visibility and the conversations that you're having with data centers as well.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Joe. I mean clearly the first half of the year has been encouraging with the demand cycle for Gas, both first and second quarter equipment orders grew north of 50%. We're also seeing the investments though, in the installed base with our services orders both growing double-digits in both the first and the second quarter. So, you're seeing the investment on both sides. I mean, we were intentional in our prepared remarks in the sense that as strong as those orders are on a year-over-year basis, with the pipeline we see, and it's a combination of US orders and global orders, we do expect the second half of the year to have more orders in the first half of the year. So first half of the year, we had 30 heavy-duty gas turbines with 12 HAs. Second half will be stronger based on what we see. But we're not in a place today that this is one transaction, one market. This is a general trend that just the realization of the need for more reliable power that's leading to increase demand into gas that's supporting us also having to invest in or gas to support that growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Moses Sutton with BNP.
Moses Sutton : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just continuing on the gas topic. How should we think of the eventual capacity constraints at Greenville and perhaps expanding the factory, especially as we know many utilities are signaling a further rise in CCGTs and peakers and so on? And then just to add to that how do you think about pricing of the gas turbines going forward and impact on margin relative to maybe historical razor blade model. Are you -- could you see something like 20% contribution margin on new gas turbines? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.
Scott Strazik : Thanks Moses. I'll start. I mean, if we had the benefit of having you visit Greenville with us you'd see that we have clear capacity to grow into this market in Greenville. But the challenge isn't going to be the Greenville factory. We're investing into single piece flow and lean lines that have given us a lot of physical capacity. We do have challenges and needs to work across our supply base and supply chain to gain access to more parts think castings and forgings. And we're going through that process right now. And that very well may lead to some investments we need to make to support this growth on a go-forward basis. But that's investments we'll make as the market tested results tell us to make those investments. But today we're not in a position that that's really our concern. I mean, we look at our slots we're pricing for the scar slots that we have. We do continue to see a healthier pricing environment for gas on orders that we'll book in 2024 into 2025 and that we'll convert into revenue approximately three years later. So we do see that over the medium to long-term as margin accretive to where the Power business segment goes. But again, these are equipment orders we're booking today at better margins that will convert three years from now.
Ken Parks : Yes. And just so you think about how we're managing through the required investments to support that we indicated in the prepared remarks that you should expect to see a little bit more CapEx coming through our numbers this year than maybe we had guided to not significantly different but a bit more. That's because these orders are on the books and we're trying to go ahead and get in place to get our capacity expanded as much as we can to support that. We're also working with our supply base to make sure our supply base is right there with us, so they can provide what we need to support those orders. I called that out, because correlating that to what we said about cash flow guidance, we took our cash flow guidance up nicely, not only just based upon the refund from the arbitration item on the legal dispute of about $300 million, but took it up by another $300 million on both ends of the range. And that is with that incremental capacity and CapEx that we're looking to invest again primarily in power, as well as trying to do things to help and keep our supply base where it needs to be. So it's a really good place to be in. But as Scott said, this is all for orders that we have on the books today, and we will continue to watch these order patterns as we move forward and try to make really good thoughtful decision. So we manage through the capital investments as well as the pricing environment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Percoco : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just want to come back to the Electrification segment. You're obviously increasing the margin guidance this quarter for the full year at the Investor Day, you kind of laid out 500 basis points of margin upside based on what was already captured in the backlog as of the end of 2023. It seems like you're capturing half of that in 2024. So I'm just curious like what's driving that? Is that an accelerated conversion of the backlog? Is it better OpEx discipline or maybe just conservatism out of the gate at the Investor Day? And then maybe as a follow-up question to that. Can you just update us on what you're seeing come to the backlog today in terms of pricing relative to what you're recognizing in 2024? Thank you.
Scott Strazik : You bet. Andrew, thank you. At the start I think exactly as you said, we in March had a view of mid-single-digit margins for the year in Electrification. Now, the first half of the year has delivered mid-single-digit margins, so by default as we shift towards the full year now delivering high single-digit margins, that gives you an indication for how much stronger we expect the margin profile to be in the second half of this year, which will then be indicative of the margin profile and growth that we expect into 2025 and beyond. There was some level of caution on our part earlier in the year on how quickly we would fulfill and be able to ramp up into this growth. This is not a business that has experienced this substantial growth trajectory. And the team is doing a very good job. And frankly, as they do a very good job that's also giving us a little bit more confidence to invest into more growth with them and more capacity for them to manage this incredibly strong market that we have right now. Now, at the same time when you step back to our discussions in March, exactly as you said, we did accrete margin 500 basis points in the backlog last year, but we also said that over 50% of that backlog doesn't start to convert to revenue until 2026. So we're pleased to see the financial performance improve in 2024 and to get to this high single-digit number, we're just getting started here. I mean there's, a lot of opportunity to improve and a lot to be excited about in Electrification, but also a lot of work to do. So we sit here today in July with a lot of optimism and a lot of confidence as we move forward.
Ken Parks: And to put a couple of finer points on it as you think about how this business is going to move. You heard us talk a lot in March not only in the electrification business, but all about doing an even stronger approach at underwriting these contracts, right? So as we even accreted the margin and backlog about 500 basis points it wasn't a matter of conservatism. As Scott said, it was a matter of this business kind of managing their execution to deliver even better margins than what we booked in backlog. So while some of that will flow out into later years what we're seeing is the execution on some of the contracts that are already in backlog we're actually landing at a better margin than what we thought that we contracted at. I give you that point, because it's not a market point it is an execution point. And I think you we want you to make sure and think about that business in the way that we are continuing to execute very well not just on the market side, but as well as how we're executing on these complicated projects. The second thing I would say is there are parts of the Electrification business that are not longer cycle, right? So some of the smaller components actually we take orders. And we may book within a few months. And because of the strength of that market the pricing that's coming through on those in the early parts of this year are going to flow out into better margins in the second half of the year. So it just supports everything that Scott said, but you've got a couple of finer points to think about how our execution sits.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Ken Parks: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good everybody. So my question is also on the heavy-duty gas turbine side. Orders were obviously great. And I guess I know all the work you've been doing to lean stuff out. That's probably not the easiest task in a kind of low volume -- low unit volume in a little bit of variable industry. So I'm a little bit curious, if there's a certain level that you can get to a real sort of process flow and really just how things consistent and predictable flowing? And what that level is if there's a margin impact when you really get to a steady state? And how large that could be for the segment if you're willing to talk about it? Thank you.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Rob. I mean, I'll start. There's clear opportunity. Although, yes, this is big pieces of infrastructure that we're building in our factories in Greenville. You can walk through that factory today. And if you had seen it five years ago to what it is today it doesn't resemble what it was. I mean we are -- I'm really proud of where we've gotten to with very high-tech single-piece flow that has eliminated an immense amount of rework in factories. We've got parts that move substantially less to the factory today because they just go on one single piece line from beginning to end as we build these gas turbines that have frankly freed up a lot of capacity in the factory to add a lot of services capacity into Greenville but frankly it also has created the capacity for us to grow into this better gas market without a need for anything other than leveraging our existing factories. So that's one of our real elements of arbitrage here because we have the industrial footprint. We have the cranes. The factories are attached to the railroads. We do have some P&E we're going to have to spend for some machinery. We're going to have to spend some money in partnership with some of our suppliers to support faster long lead items to meet this market, but this is work we know how to do. So Ken effectively laid out the fact that our free cash flow guide for this year is already incorporating some of those investments on orders that have already booked in the first half of the year. And as the order strength continues where it makes sense we'll continue to make more of those investments.
Ken Parks: Yes. And you asked a great question around the impact on ultimate margins, but as Scott just kind of leaned into the point is not only is it a margin impact. But as we continue to kind of moved down this lean journey and the gas power business is further along than most in our portfolio. It's also an optimizing of our working capital impact. So that flows straight to free cash flow. So even though we're going to invest a little bit more in CapEx early we know that that will bring us benefits on cash flow side and all of this runs down to better margins as well as better cash generation.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore.
Scott Strazik: Good morning, James.
James West: Hey, good morning. Good morning, Scott. Good morning, Ken.
Scott Strazik: Good morning.
James West: I am curious Scott if you could maybe elaborate on your grid and grid infrastructure and transistor businesses because I think that's going to be a big area of growth. I know that you guys have historically been strong in Europe and the US, but I believe this is a much more global business than any of us actually realize. And so I love some commentary on the outlook and maybe some education on that business.
Scott Strazik: James, I appreciate it. I mean the reality is you're right. I mean historically this has been a more European-centric business. That is true. But as we framed up in the prepared remarks this is a business segment that saw our orders double over the course of the second quarter. So I think the reality is our Electrification segment in grid is the part of GE Vernova that's benefiting the most from Vernova. And what I mean by that is we're really able to lean in in a much more coordinated way on the front end of this business with our relationships on the Power and Wind side and are finding an ability to pull-through even more grid growth with very strong customer relationships in places like the US. And as one company and organized as one company where especially with things like key accounts we're driving another level of coordinated activity, we're starting to really bear fruit from that. When we think about the strategic sessions we're having with our customers, it is true that an electrification especially in the US, we're doing an education, even with our customers on what the art of the possible is. And it gives me that much more optimism that beyond the fact that this is a good market and a good global market, especially in the US, I have a lot of optimism with where this business is going. So you really have a conviction case in Europe where since the crisis in Ukraine, our European customers are spending at incredibly high levels to give themselves real -- another level of resiliency and energy independence that's driving grid growth. The US isn't growing as fast, but candidly, we have more arbitrage to lean into with the Vernova benefits that are helping us right now. And over the longer term, Asia is going to be an important market too. But this is very much a lot about Western Europe and North America. But those markets alone with customers we know very well and have very strong relationships, converging at a time where Philippe and the team are simply running this business a lot better are two converging factors that give us real possibility to create a business that we're very excited about here.
Ken Parks: And maybe just again, just to kind of give you a little bit of perspective on how to kind of think about where the numbers are. If you take HVDC and I'm going to talk about orders in the second quarter and it kind of holds for the first half as well. If you take HVDC orders kind of out of the order totals for Electrification, the remainder of the orders within the electrification business are fairly evenly spread across North America, Europe and rest of world. So we like that because while HVDC is coming in strong in Europe as Scott mentioned, the carry-on impact is really affecting all of the regions around the world. So this business is feeling much more balanced globally when you look at it in that perspective.
Michael Lapides: Operator, we have time for one last question please.
Operator: This question will come from the line of Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho.
Maheep Mandloi: Hey. Can you guys hear me?
Scott Strazik: We can. Good morning.
Maheep Mandloi: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the questions here. Just looking at the 10-Q, the product warranty liabilities reduced from $1.4 billion down $1.2 billion in the quarter. So just trying to understand what's driving that. And then in light of the AEP lawsuit and potential environmental liabilities and Massachusetts just how to think about where that number goes here? Thanks.
Ken Parks: Yeah. So it's a good question. I would just think about it this way. Really no fundamental change in warranties the way we're accruing warranties. The real difference right there Maheep is just the fact that as we take the portion of the steam business that we sold to EDF and take their balances off the books that made essentially that change in that warranty accrual. So there's really no other dynamics going on there. We're still accruing the same way. We're seeing the same kind of patterns of trends. So nothing of significance there outside of the disposition of that piece of that business.
Michael Lapides: Before we wrap up, let me turn it back to Scott. Scott, closing comments?
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Everyone, we're excited about the trajectory of our company going forward. I do want to take a minute as we conclude the call and just thank our employees, our partners for their dedication and hard work and our customers for their continued trust in us. And thank you for your interest in GE Vernova.
Michael Lapides: Thank you. We'll turn it back over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-25 07:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to GE Vernova's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Michael Lapides, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Michael Lapides: Thank you. Welcome to GE Vernova's first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Scott Strazik; and our CFO, Ken Parks. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically do not have any obligation to do so. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. With that, I'll hand the call over to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call after successfully completing our launch as an independent company on April 2nd. We delivered solid results in the first quarter. I'm pleased with how we are executing on the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day on March 6th. We're excited about the opportunity ahead for GE Vernova, a purpose built company to electrify and decarbonize the world. Even in the last seven weeks since our Investor Day, the drumbeat of dialogue is only growing louder with the customers and policymakers on the challenges and opportunities ahead to meet growing demand, while accelerating our decarbonization pathway. These macro trends are creating real opportunities for us to continue to lead in the energy transition, while we are running our businesses better, driving disciplined growth, margin expansion, and higher free cash flow. If we shift to the left hand side of the page, lean remains at our core, driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery, and cost. And as we do with most of our meetings at GE Vernova, I want to start today on safety. Our focus here is driving real results with our injury and illness rate improving 5% over the last 12 months. We have had no fatalities year-to-date and we'll always run GE Vernova with safety as the top priority to ensure every employee, contractor, and partner we work with goes home safely each day. To give a little more color on lean, we executed on over 800 Kaizen events in Q1 '24 alone. And I'd like to share with you an example of the progress we are making with one of the Kaizen events where I participated for three days in January in our grid automation business in Ontario, Canada. Grid automation is an important business inside electrification that provides protection and controls for electrical substations on the grid in addition to solutions for monitoring and diagnostics for essential electrical equipment like transformers and breakers. This business is experiencing double digit top-line growth, but still has parts of its supply chain using batch processing for inventory. At the Kaizen event, three teams executed on transforming batch processing of generator protection panels into a lean line with single piece flow, focusing on pre-wiring activity first. Since the Kaizen event in January, we've seen our work in progress inventory reduced by over 50%, output has increased 15%, and we've decreased the distance parts traveled to site by roughly 80% for this pre-wiring. This is just one example of what is happening every week across GE Vernova to enable us to decrease delivery times, increase output, and lower costs, ultimately improving outcomes for our customers. In addition to embedding lean within our facilities, we are also using lean to simplify our business operations and reduce our costs. Our Q1 G&A growing versus Q1 '23 is not one of the areas our leadership team is happy about as we sit here in April, but our expenses now reflect the additional costs of our standup as a public company, as well as the cost transferred from GE corporate on IT, finance, and HR. We are laser focused on action with urgency, leveraging lean to eliminate waste in our G&A processes. Now I'd like to spend a minute on the right hand side of the page. On our three business segment trends and the markets they serve. Our power businesses, led by Gas Power and the over 7,000 gas turbines in the fleet are continuing to see strong uptick in demand. Our utilization of the gas fleet depending on geography is growing low-single digits, driving continued strength in our high margin services business. In addition, with expected increases in electricity demand growth in the coming years, along with a continued shift away from coal, interest in adding incremental gas capacity is growing. Customers are focused on how capacity additions this decade can be decarbonized in the next decade with both hydrogen and carbon capture. Gas Power Services orders increased double-digits in the first quarter and equipment orders grew 75% versus last year, showing the robust demand for services into our installed base and trends for new gas capacity. We are accelerating our focus and our strategy working with our supply chain partners on how to potentially create incremental capacity to meet this growing demand. I along with others on the leadership team are spending time with the team in Greenville in a few weeks to focus specifically on this. Turning to Wind, we continue to expand margins as we improve this business, benefiting from a better onshore wind backlog in a lower cost structure in total. Even in a very low volume Q1 with just over a 1 billion of onshore wind revenue, the onshore wind business still delivered positive EBITDA for the third straight quarter. As discussed at 4Q earnings, we expect second half revenue will be substantially higher than first half revenue with a larger North America mix. While we remain cautious on the exact timing of significant onshore wind orders growth in the U.S., as our customers navigate the challenges that come with permitting new projects. We are very excited about where this business performance can go as the orders and revenue accelerate in the medium term. In offshore, we are working through our existing backlog, and while believe offshore is key to the energy transition, we will remain highly selective on new orders. Finally, electrification, our fastest growing segment, profitable growth continues to accelerate as customers modernize and invest in the grid. Significant demand exists for a number of our products such as transformers and switch gears, products key to ensuring a reliable electricity system and for connecting new generation. Orders this quarter were over 2x revenue, which we expect will drive revenue and profit growth well into the future, given healthy margins on what we added to backlog. Of our three business segments, electrification is the one where we have the best opportunity to challenge ourselves on both growth and margins we can achieve in the medium term, given this segment has the strongest demand and pricing dynamics. Turning now to our first quarter performance, where we delivered a solid start to the year. We will continue to be disciplined on our top-line growth. And Q1 had orders down 1% and organic revenue growth of 5% versus the prior year. Our backlog continued to grow up over $8 billion compared to Q1 '23 with healthy margins. Overall, we expanded margins increasing almost 500 basis points. All three segments improved margins driven by price, productivity and continued cost reductions combined with high-single digit services growth. In the quarter, we improved free cash flow compared to last year and expect a meaningful acceleration in cash flow as we move through the year. We are reaffirming the guidance provided at Investor Day in March. For more details around that and our first quarter performance, I will turn the call over to Ken.
Kenneth Parks: Thanks, Scott. Turning to Slide 5, I'll speak to our results on an organic and adjusted basis, which best represents the underlying performance of our business. As Scott mentioned, we delivered solid results with significant EBITDA margin expansion in each of our segments and continued improvement in free cash flow. Orders reached $9.7 billion and were approximately 1.3x first quarter revenue further expanding our backlog to $116 billion. Year-over-year orders declined slightly as lower equipment orders in wind and electrification more than offset strong equipment orders in power and double-digit growth in total service orders. Importantly, we continue to drive our strategy focused on disciplined profitable growth. As a result, equipment margin and backlog remained healthy. Revenue grew 5% with strength in Electrification and Power, partially offset by lower revenue in wind. Services were strong, growing 8% led by Power. All three segments benefited from positive price in the quarter. EBITDA margins expanded 470 basis points year-over-year with all segments delivering at least 300 basis points of expansion in the quarter. The first quarter expansion includes the impact of standalone cost in line with our expectation. These costs are not included in the prior year results. Margin expansion was driven by price, productivity and volume. We also continue to benefit from our announced restructuring actions, which together these more than offset inflation and higher R&D investments. The first quarter is our seasonally lowest free cash flow quarter, followed by sequentially improving quarters as the year progresses. While we had a net outflow of $661 million this was an approximately $150 million improvement over last year and was largely driven by improved earnings, partially offset by higher working capital outflows. Working capital was an approximately $500 million outflow in the quarter, driven by inventory build as we prepare to deliver second half volume along with higher disbursements, partially due to settlements of payables with GE in preparation for the spin. Increased milestone collections on equipment projects partially offset these outflows. Turning to Power on Slide 6, the segment delivered strong first quarter results with orders and revenue growth as well as EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 24%, led by higher equipment orders at Gas Power. During the first quarter, we booked eight HA gas turbine orders, four more than the same quarter last year and equal to HA orders in the full-year of 2023. We also booked orders for 18 aeroderivative units. Services grew low-double digits driven by gas. Revenue grew 4%, higher outages drove gas services growth along with favorable price. EBITDA nearly doubled and grew over 60% organically with 340 basis points of margin expansion as higher margin services volume along with price and productivity more than offset the impact of inflation. We're off to a good start in Power. Our gas fleet utilization has been trending higher this year, up low-single digits, benefiting from continued coal to gas switching and the increased demand for reliable and dispatchable power. We'll continue to evaluate strategies to meet a potential further acceleration in Gas Power demand as the outlook solidifies. Turning to Wind, we continue to make good progress on our turnaround driving improved EBITDA even at lower revenue levels. Orders declined 40% largely attributable to lower onshore orders. We remain focused on disciplined profitable growth in selected geographic areas such as North America, where our scale and strong manufacturing footprint provides advantages to our customers. Importantly, we see North American developers rebuilding their project pipeline as evidenced by the growing onshore interconnection queues. Revenue declined 7% from lower onshore equipment volume, partially offset by higher offshore equipment deliveries as we continue to execute on our offshore backlog. Wind services increased over 20%, driven by higher onshore parts sales in the U.S. EBITDA margins improved 400 basis points versus the prior year from continued cost reductions and positive price. Onshore EBITDA was positive for the third consecutive quarter, while offshore which still generated loss improved sequentially. Wind results are demonstrating clear signs of progress. We're integrating onshore and offshore centered around three key workhorse products, which is resulting in improved quality, better availability and incremental cost savings. Combined with higher second half onshore volume projections based on our existing backlog, we anticipate improving profitability as we move through the year. At Electrification, we had a very strong quarter of revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders were strong at $3.6 billion more than 2x first quarter revenue, although 10% lower year-over-year given the large tenant HVDC orders recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Within Grid Solutions, the largest business in our Electrification segment, we saw increased demand for high voltage switchgear equipment and transformers, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Revenue grew 21% with strength in equipment, led by growth in Grid Solutions across the business. Segment EBITDA margin expanded approximately 600 basis points driven by volume, productivity and price. Grid Solutions generated another quarter of positive EBITDA and continued improvement year-over-year. Strong demand is driving continued electrification revenue growth. EBITDA margins are expanding as a result of the volume growth along with favorable pricing and productivity. Equipment backlog in this segment is up $6 billion compared to the first quarter of 2023 with healthy margins. Turning to Slide 9, based upon our solid start to the year, we're reaffirming our guidance provided at our Investor Day last month. For full-year 2024, we continue to forecast revenue in the $34 billion to $35 billion range with adjusted EBITDA margin at the high end of mid-single-digits. We expect free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $1.1 billion. Following our outflow in the first quarter, this implies free cash flow of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion over the balance of the year with continued improvement as we move through each of the three quarters ahead. By segment, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Power, driven by higher gas services and equipment with approximately 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. In wind, we expect revenue to be essentially flat and to approach profitability from positive price, productivity and cost savings. As previously noted, we anticipate higher U.S. onshore volume in the second half compared to the first and expect that to drive full-year onshore EBITDA margins to high-single-digits. In electrification, we anticipate continuing strong demand and favorable price to drive low double-digit organic revenue growth with mid-single-digit margins due to the higher volume and price, as well as productivity benefits. In addition, our 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin guidance anticipates $300 million to $350 million of corporate and other costs, which includes approximately $200 million of incremental standalone costs. Looking specifically at the second quarter, we expect modest year-over-year top line growth and continued EBITDA margin expansion across the segments. Relative to last year's second quarter, Power should grow its top line from higher equipment and services revenue. EBITDA margins should benefit from the volume and pricing growth as well as ongoing productivity. Wind revenue is expected to decline, but EBITDA should further improve as we see the positive impact from better pricing and reduced costs. Electrification should continue to deliver strong top line growth along with improved margins from favorable pricing, higher volume and resulting productivity. We expect continued free cash flow improvement year-over-year in the second quarter. Year-over-year favorability is anticipated to be better than what we delivered in the first quarter as we continue to execute on our working capital velocity improvement actions. We're very encouraged with the solid financial performance to start the year. We see continued healthy demand for our products and services and our execution is driving stronger EBITDA margins and increased free cash flow. We're also confident in the strength of our balance sheet. Upon launch on April 2nd, our cash balance was $4.2 billion and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. With that, let me turn it back to Scott.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. All in, we are pleased with our momentum to start the year. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi decade growth across Power, Wind and Electrification segments, whether it's helping our customers meet rising electricity demand, to decarbonize their systems, or to modernize and expand the grid, we are uniquely positioned to support their needs. Our Power segment generates 70% of its revenues from services as we support our large installed base that drives strong, consistent and growing free cash flow. Wind is a key part of the energy transition, representing only 7% of the world's electricity today. By 2040, wind will need to be close to 25% in order for the world to achieve its decarbonization goals. We expect to continue expanding margins in wind. Our Electrification segment is our highest growth business and margins and backlog continue to rise. We are seeing customers significantly increase planned grid related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero carbon power sources. As discussed earlier, our lean operating system, sustainability and innovation are the core of our company. We are committed to driving sustainability and to help customers advance their efforts to deliver on electrification and decarbonization. We are running our businesses better and benefiting from increasing demand as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing EBITDA and free cash flow for a long time. And when we put all this together, we see a clear opportunity to create substantial value for all stakeholders going forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of the call.
Michael Lapides: Thank you, Scott. Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Please return to the queue, if you have follow-ups. Operator, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: Yes, good morning. Thank you very much for taking our questions and congrats on getting the spin across the finish line. So I guess my one question will be kind of starting on the equipment side, pretty noteworthy, you booked eight -- HA turbines in the quarter equal to all of 2023. My question is broader than just the HA turbines, but can you just kind of give a bit more color on the sales pipeline you have? When we should expect that to convert to orders? Is it rational to think about book-to-bill being greater than one for the year? And just kind of an update on when those orders might convert into revenue? Thank you.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Mark. I'll take that. I mean, for sure in the gas business, we are seeing increased demand for new capacity additions. In the first quarter, that was very focused on both North America and the Middle East and it was growth in both HAs, but also air derivative applications. As I mentioned earlier, it is forcing us to kind of revisit our capacity additions and think through how we can continue to support this growth and what's coming from here. And I do think it's very practical to think this year that our orders in gas equipment could very well be larger than our revenue with a growing backlog. And then you really have to think about our conversion cycle of really two to three years from order to revenue with our gas equipment book. But exciting start to the year, good sentiments and acknowledgment that gas is going to play a critical role here this decade. But I also think an acknowledgment from a number of our customers that they're getting more confidence and conviction in our ability to decarbonize gas in future decades with hydrogen and carbon capture. So good start, lot more to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Hey, good morning guys. Do you hear me okay?
Scott Strazik: We can, Joe. Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, great. Yes, congrats on you, getting out as a public company. So my one question, just maybe staying on Power for a second, it is pretty notable to see the service orders also up double-digits. I'm curious how much of that is being driven by just adding new orders on the equipment side and getting those orders on contracts versus what you are seeing on the spot market and really the basis of my question is really just trying to understand whether we are in a period of time now where you have not been adding a ton of generation capacity. And could we be in a period of time where services sees a really healthy level of growth going forward?
Scott Strazik: You bet, Joe. I mean, it's a start, I would just emphasize that double-digit orders growth really isn't connected to new capacity additions or orders there. That's really the existing installed base and is evidence of our customers investing in that installed base. I mean as Ken framed up, utilization of the fleet is growing, you're seeing a customer base that clearly sees the integral role that gas is going to play and is investing into that fleet with different operating parameters and as we look through this year and what we see in gas services, we do continue to see gas services strength throughout 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Moses Sutton with BNP Paribas.
Moses Sutton: Hi, can you hear me?
Scott Strazik: We can, Moses.
Moses Sutton: Thanks for taking my question. I guess continuing on the gas theme here, 4.9 gigawatts is I know it could be lumpy, but it's 40% higher than the average quarter last year. What's the maximum you could see this annualized in the short to medium term? And can you talk a little bit more about geography, Middle East versus U.S. versus other? Any thoughts there on new equipment orders in detail?
Scott Strazik: Yes. Moses, I would just emphasize again, the first quarter orders were very centric in the Middle East and in North America. We had previously gone through a cycle with real growth in Asia. We still see a lot of pipeline there, but the first quarter was more centered on those regions. But when we look at our pipeline, there's healthy global demand for new gas additions. The U.S. has a healthy pipeline. We're revisiting really how we serve that market because simultaneously we're seeing services demand growth and new gas capacity demand growth. And with it, it's having us work with our supply chain partners to look at over the medium term how we can serve that demand. So, we're working our way through that and I'll come back with further updates in that regard as we work through the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
David Ridley-Lane: Yes, hi, good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Can you talk about the composition of electrification orders this quarter, 2.2x book-to-bill is very impressive. And kind of what are the products and conversion timelines on those orders this quarter?
Scott Strazik: Yes. Thank you, Dave. The composition of the orders, we saw good growth in the grid businesses and across all components of the grid business. So power transformers, grid services, saw that happen there. The composition is in the areas where in that space we tend to see longer delivery cycles. So one of the things that we talked about last year was that we saw about 500 basis points of expansion in our grid backlog, our equipment backlog for the electrification business, a lot of that being in grid. The good news with that is because they are longer cycle deliveries. what we feel really good about is the margin expansion that we're seeing in that business and the fact that electrification is anticipated to get to mid-single digits, EBIT margins in 2024 and we talked about that continuing to expand into 2025. But this strong orders and backlog that's coming into electrification will be something that supports margin expansion on those higher backlogs and margin as we move out past the 2025 timeframe. So, really good opportunities within the electrification space, good orders across the business and a good timeline in front of it for us for the business to benefit from stronger margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets.
Chris Dendrinos: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I guess just really, really strong momentum coming into the year. I'm curious how does that kind of compare against your internal expectations? Then, I’m sure we interpret this as perhaps you’re outperforming what your expectations were coming in and does that mean continued strength into the back half of the year? Thanks.
Scott Strazik: Yes. It's a really good question and thank you for it. As you think about the year, we're always going to be a little bit more seasonally focused towards the second half of the year versus the first. So, when I give you this answer, the reality is, are we doing well against our expectations? Yes. in a very good out of the start performance for the Q1. Keep in mind that's our relatively smallest quarter of the year, but the strength of what we're seeing in the orders and the execution, whether it be pricing productivity, cost reductions, very, very good. I would tell you that, that gives us confidence that we can reaffirm to you the statements we've made about the year. but it doesn't mean we're going to change anything at this point in time. but the momentum out of the gates really gives us incremental confidence that we are on a path to deliver exactly what we told you for the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: Hey. good morning, guys and congrats again, on the first quarter out of the box.
Kenneth Parks: Thanks, James.
Scott Strazik: Thank you, James.
James West: So, Scott, curious, I want to go back to electrification. That's where I think you're most bullish. We're most bullish definitely on that. We're now getting inbounds from not just the normal players, electrification. but tech company executives, tech company investors trying to lever into the themes of AI and data center growth. And I'm curious what you're seeing in the end markets and how your conversations are evolving? Because it seems like for broadly the markets coming to this idea or this realization that power demand is going to run well ahead of deployment, electricity deployment?
Scott Strazik: James, I agree. I think the demand is real and the uptick is very clear with the different counterparties that we're working with. both our traditional customers and iterating with our maybe their end customers to understand what the art of the possible is, whether it be the technology companies, the hyperscalers. And the conversations are very focused on a lot of what we've been talking about inside GE Vernova for the last few years, which is it's going to be an all of the above technology portfolio needed to serve this growing market. Gas is going to play a critical role. It's a power dense solution that supports the operating parameters of a lot of things like data center needs. but at the same time, we're doing a lot of work right now on how wind growth can fulfill that demand, and solar is going to play an important role. We're having conversations on into next decade how small modular reactors is going to play a role. and regardless of the power generation source, electrification equipment is critical and whether that be the transformers or the electrical equipment inside the data centers, it gives us real opportunity to grow our business from here. So, it's tough to call exactly when these conversations translate to orders and that may not be tomorrow. but the demand is certainly real in the medium term and we're really encouraged by our opportunity to serve that market.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho.
Maheep Mandloi: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking your questions and congratulations on the first quarter here. Just two small ones from me. So, first on electrification theme, could you talk about where the geographic mix of the orders we're getting from? And separately on offshore wind, if you could talk to the NYSERDA's RFP for the manufacturing and logistics, any thoughts on if you'll be participating on that?
Kenneth Parks: Sure. I'll start with the electrification question. On the mix of the orders, our business in general is more heavily weighted to Europe. We do have North America presence for sure. And I would say the orders are coming probably more primarily across the European base. but we are seeing good interest and good demand in North America. We continue to focus that business on not only being heavily European based. but we see a great market as outlined by Scott and some of his comments previously to be really good as the U.S. is starting to focus more heavily on its grid optimization strategies. So, while we've seen a mix today that's probably a little bit more heavily focused to Europe, we see great opportunity for that business to expand the really good things that they're doing in Europe into North America. Maybe, I'll give the offshore wind question and let Scott answer that one.
Scott Strazik: You bet. Thanks, Ken. And, Mahid, on offshore wind, I'd first just reinforce that we view offshore wind as an important part of the energy transition here. and we've been very appreciative of our iteration and partnership with New York State and NYSERDA on the New York 3 auction. With the phase that offshore wind has been in generally over the last few years, it's been hard to get projects to a point that they're ready to thrive. But through our iteration with our customers and where we're going, I want to tell you, we're excited about our future product here, 15.5-megawatt product that has an ability to have a power boost up to 16.5 megawatts. We're working hard to have that prototype running by the end of 2025. And when we look at where we are with our Haliade-X product today, the 14-megawatt product, by the time you get into 2026, we're going to have somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 million to 6 million operating hours with that product. So, there's a lot to work on today. We believe that offshore wind is going to play an important role in the energy transition, appreciative for the iteration of the partnership with New York State and the many other states and geographies we're working on to build the industry. but at the same time, we've been pretty consistent for a while that we are only going to add to that backlog with materially different economic terms than what is in our backlog today. and that's a combination of many things, price, other terms and really leaning in on projects that are set to thrive. and there's a lot of complexity in offshore wind that we're all learning from and we're going to keep working on it every day, because we do believe it's going to play a role in the energy transition. but we're only going to add to the backlog when it's meaningfully different than what we're executing on today.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Yes. hi. I guess I'd like to start with Power and I know you've given comments on geographic strength and so forth. But could you talk about U.S. Utility demand. and just, I think we've all woken up to kind of the shift in the world that AI is pulling forward on electricity demand. What's the reaction of utilities to that? Are they two years ahead of us? Do you have a lot in pipeline? Or is that something that's shifting kind of in real time now? And then if you would, could you remind us or discuss briefly the economics on Aeroderivatives on both new builds or the actual new order and service? Thank you.
Scott Strazik: You bet, Rob. I appreciate the question. I would say that our utility customers have been working towards a demand build here over the last few years. but admittedly, the load growth projections for many of our customers have become a steeper demand curve sooner in the last, let's say, six to 12 months. and that is accelerating discussions on our end on things like framework agreements to secure capacity for them with future heavy-duty equipment while they firm up, project sites for development that make most sense for them. So, there clearly is a macro theme in the U.S., specifically, with our U.S. utility customers that many of them are going to have incremental gas capacity additions. But like any power project, it's not a straight line to kind of get things to close through permitting and otherwise, and customers are working very hard on that. So, we are bullish on the capacity addition, optionality or opportunity ahead for us with our utility customers and are going to work it very hard. On the second part of your question with Aeroderivatives, this is one of the more exciting growth parts of Gas Power. The reality is the Aeroderivative product line is so well suited to be the complement to 200-megawatt to 300-megawatt blocks of wind or solar that just need fast ramping technical solutions to support that zero-carbon power. So, in many ways, when we talk about gas power being a force multiplier that enables other zero carbon power sources to grow faster, Aeroderivatives is the perfect illustration of that. Now, the general economics for us with Aeroderivatives are the equipment margins are more healthy than they are on a heavy duty gas turbine project. because admittedly, the services annuity stream and the operating profile of those Aeroderivative units may not be as high or as consistent that we can count on. because they're really there more as a support to those wind or solar farms that get developed. So, when we underwrite gas projects on a heavy-duty project, where it's something like a coal to gas switching, a larger proportion of the economics are on the services. With Aeroderivatives, a larger proportion of the economics for us are with the day one equipment revenue.
Kenneth Parks: Liz, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: This question will come from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that Onshore Wind already achieved positive EBITDA in the quarter. Given the seasonality of the overall wind segment, do you anticipate getting to positive EBITDA for this segment as a whole at any point before the end of the year on a quarterly basis?
Kenneth Parks: So, what we said in our guidance is that we anticipate that with the continued improvement in wind, as well as the delivery of our offshore wind backlog, but -- which is generating losses, but improving as we deliver that backlog is that we would approach profitability for 2024. Now that does have a lot of really good fundamentals built within that, which is number one, we talked about the fact that revenue for Onshore Wind in the first half would be challenged in the sense of our developers. our customers are working to rebuild their pipelines and that we would see the orders start to come in as we move through the year. But what we do feel on the second half of the year is based upon the backlog that we have on hand in the Onshore Wind business. We expect to see revenues in Onshore Wind be measurably higher in the second half than we're seeing in the first half of the year. That will contribute to improve productivity. because as we said, we're anticipating onshore wind to be more at a high single-digit's EBITDA margin business for 2024 in totality. I give you that background, because the good performance in all of our businesses, as well as wind out of the gate, has us on track to approach profitability for 2024. If we reach that at a sooner point, we'll know that as we move through some of the bigger quarters of the year. but our guidance is that we will get close to profitability this year for the segment in totality.
Michael Lapides: Before we wrap up, let me turn it back to Scott for closing comments.
Scott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Everyone, in short, I hope you can hear the excitement in our voices and the opportunity we have in front of us to serve this market. I also want to thank our employees, the process of separating from a 130-year-old plus company, while continuing to focus on serving our customers and the operations, is not always an easy balance. And I think in the first 90 days of the year, our teams did an excellent job with that. I also want to thank our customers for their continued trust in us and the continued iteration that we're having right now on these growth markets that we're facing into. For everyone on the call today, thank you for your interest in GE Vernova. We're just getting started, but I really like our chances from here. So, thanks for the time. And with that, I think we'll wrap the call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
