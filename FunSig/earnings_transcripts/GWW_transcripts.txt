Operator: Greetings and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Kyle Bland, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland : Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC. This morning's call will focus on results for the first quarter of 2025, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis. Definitions and full reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers discussed will differ from MonotaRO's public statements. Now, I will turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and we appreciate everyone joining the call. Despite the unpredictable environment, the first few months of 2025 have panned out much like we expected. The business continues to perform well as our team stays focused on serving our customers and delivering value to our stakeholders. While tariffs are certainly a topic of conversation, customers remain acutely focused on running their businesses safely and efficiently. I recently had the chance to visit a large corporate campus where we work alongside a facilities maintenance organization to support this customer. Our team shows up as a trusted partner, helping the customer solve the challenges they face on the ground each day, including ordering, organizing and managing their MRO inventory. It was again apparent that local on-site execution is critical to creating value for our customers. This visit was a good reminder that no matter what the external environment. It is important to stay focused on what we can control to ensure that we capitalize on a significant opportunity in the market. Although it's largely business as usual on the ground the external environment remains highly fluid. We're working closely with our supplier partners to understand the full impact that announced tariffs will have on our business. Fortunately, the investments we've made in our product information and pricing capabilities our scale and the depth of our sourcing know-how position Grainger to effectively navigate the situation. As we move forward we remain committed to ensuring transparency with our customers and adhering to our core pricing tenants. Offering market relevant pricing while targeting price cost neutrality over time. Distributors generally benefit from modest inflationary environments and depending on the depth and duration of the tariff uncertainty. It may play out that way, but the situation remains highly unpredictable. In any case we expect to play a key role in helping our customers navigate this current challenge and I'm confident in the team's ability to remain agile in this dynamic environment. Moving to Q1 results, while the band environment remain muted, we delivered another quarter solid growth and profitability in line with the quarterly financial targets we communicated for the company in January. We continue to leverage technology, our product and customer information advantage and analytical capabilities to drive differentiated value for our customers in both segments. Total company reported sales for the quarter were up 1.7% or 4.4% on a daily constant currency basis. Operating margins for the company remain healthy at 15.6% and diluted EPS finished the quarter of $0.24 to $9.86. Operating cash flow came in at $646 million which allowed us to return a total of $380 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Lastly, I want to mention that yesterday we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 54th consecutive year of expected dividend increases. This reflects our continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a balanced and return focused approach. Overall the quarter finished largely in line with expectations that we remain on track to deliver our 2025 guidance. I will now turn it over to Dee.
Deidra Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. Turning to Slide 7 you can see the high-level first quarter results for the total company including $4.3 billion in sales of 4.4% on a daily constant currency basis. Within the period we saw gross margin improvement across both segments, which mostly offset SG&A deleverage and high-touch. This led to total company operating margins of 15.6% for the quarter down 20 basis points compared to 2024 but above our communicated first quarter expectations largely due to the timing of certain SG&A items, Diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.86 was up $0.24 or 2.5% higher compared to the prior year period. Moving to segment level results the High-Touch solution segment got off to a slower start as weather holiday timing and some government softness across January and February impacted results to begin the year. In Total sales were down 0.2% on a reported basis or up 1.9% on a daily constant currency basis. Results were driven by continued volume growth and modest price contribution within the segment and we deliver growth across all geographies and local days local currency. In the US specifically, we saw strong performance with contractors and healthcare customers which helped to offset slower growth in other areas including manufacturing. For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 42.4%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year. In the quarter gross margin benefited from favorable product mix and supplier funding tailwind related to the annual Grainger sales meeting. Each of these items contributed roughly half of the year over your gross margin favorability. For the quarter price cost was roughly neutral. SG&A cost for the segment increased over the prior year period, as we continue to invest in demand generating activities and reflect the P&L impact of the annual Grainger sales meeting which was an equal offset to the favorability we saw in gross margin. These costs coupled with the softer top line and one fewer selling day in the current year, led to SG&A deleverage of 80 basis points for the quarter. If you normalize for one fewer selling day and the impact of the Grainger sales meeting, SG&A only slightly delevered year-over-year. Taking all of this together, operating margin remained healthy at 17.7%, down 20 basis points versus Q1 2024, but ahead of our expectations to start the year. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, on a volume-only basis using the manufacturing subcomponent of industrial production as a proxy, implied growth for the U.S. MRO market volume was 1% to 1.5% in the quarter. With our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business driving 1.3% volume growth, this would suggest mathematical market outgrowth on a volume basis was roughly flat in Q1, which was surprising to us even with our slower start in January and February. While tariffs have not had a meaningful impact on our business to date, they seem to be inflating the underlying IP benchmark, likely reflecting trade-related noise as manufacturers react abnormally given the unique environment. The IP benchmark has been a strong accessible indicator of our overall MRO industry performance over multiple cycles, but its ability to capture the dynamic and unprecedented nature of the current economic environment is uncertain. As we've been discussing over the last year, we run a separate internal model in parallel to help triangulate around MRO volume growth. This internal model pulls in several supply and demand factors, including MRO product shipments, import-export dynamics, and end-user activity to formulate a comprehensive view of the MRO landscape, including segments outside of manufacturing. This internal view suggests that the MRO market volume actually declined in the low single digits during the first quarter, implying we drove several hundred basis points of outgrowth. While the two different models have been highly correlated during normal business cycles, the divergence calls into question the relevance of our quarterly outgrowth disclosure given the uncertain environment. It is likely that this quarterly disconnect will persist so long as trade policy and tariffs continue to influence the manufacturer's production decisions. With this, moving forward, we're pivoting to an annual disclosure of our outgrowth metric. We believe this decision will create less quarter-to-quarter noise and allow us to stay focused on discussing the drivers of our growth while keeping an eye on our relative performance compared to competition. We'll consider reintroducing the quarterly disclosure when the macro environment stabilizes, and in the meantime, look forward to sharing our annual progress on volume outgrowth at the end of the year. It's important to note that, despite the noise in the metric, we still delivered on our first quarter sales expectation, and this change in disclosure has no impact on the full-year High-Touch segment sales guidance we discussed back in January. Moreover, nothing is changing with our long-term earnings algorithm, including our annual volume outgrowth target, which remains at 400 to 500 basis points. Now, focusing on endless assortment. Sales increased 10.3% or 15.3% on a daily constant currency basis, which is just for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 18.4%, while MonotaRO achieved 13.6% growth in local days, local currency. At a business level, Zoro continues its momentum, once again delivering strong growth underpinned by its core B2B customers and improving retention rates. At MonotaRO, sales growth remains strong with enterprise customers coupled with solid acquisition and repeat purchase rates with small and mid-sized businesses. On a reported basis, these results were partially offset by foreign exchange as the yen devaluation represented a headwind year over year. On profitability, operating margins for the segment increased by 80 basis points to 8.7%, with both businesses contributing to the favorability. MonotaRO margins remained strong at 12% with continued DC efficiencies driving improved operating leverage. At Zoro, operating margins were up 240 basis points to 5.2%, aided by gross margin flow through and strong top line leverage. Gross margins outpaced expectations as we made some non-tariff-related pricing changes in the quarter, the benefit of which we expect to moderate slightly as the year continues. Overall, we're encouraged by the strong progress made in the quarter and expect to continue our momentum across this segment. Given the environment, I think it would be helpful to share an overview of how we see the current tariff landscape. On Slide 12, there are a few things to call out. First, it's early innings and things are constantly adjusting. Even with the original Chinese tariffs, which have been in effect for nearly 60 days, we're only recently completing negotiations with a subset of our supplier partners regarding tariff-related cost increases. So while we've seen a swift pace of tariff-related headlines, things are progressing more slowly on the ground. Second, understanding the full impact that the tariffs have on our business is not straightforward and needs to be quantified at a granular level. You can see our total U.S. COGS exposure on the left-hand side of the slide, with around 50% being domestically sourced and the remainder comprised of import products, including those from China. As others in the markets have discussed, this view of COGS is on a country of origin basis and does not further deconstruct individual product components by their respective country of origin. What we can do is take the announced tariff rates and apply that to our total COGS exposure to estimate the impact. You have to go through each product and evaluate its composition and cost structure. This includes answering questions like, what are the input components and where are they sourced, how much of their cost is freight-related, et cetera. You need to do this by-product to grasp what elements are subject to tariffs as you adhere to the government tariff schedule and engage in cost conversations with our supplier base. Given the investment we've made in product information, the tools we've built, and the product teardown work we've completed over the last several years, we feel we are well-equipped to navigate this challenge. As we gain clarity on costs, we'll work to pass along these increases to our customers similar to what we do for other cost increases we received. With this earlier today, we took initial pricing actions primarily related to Section 232 and the first wave of announced tariffs on China, which did not include any increases related to the recent reciprocal escalations. These initial pricing actions only apply to a small portion of our products, largely those where Grainger is importing the product directly. On the vast majority of our products where we don't directly import, we are taking a measured approach and will wait to pass price until we have clarity on the amount and timing of cost increases. Our goal here will be to mitigate impacts to our business and achieve price-cost neutrality over time. Obviously, if the heightened reciprocal tariffs persist, we would need to consider source of supply and overall product economics to determine what course of action we would need to take. It goes without saying, but this remains a very fluid situation, and we're working side-by-side with our suppliers and customers alike. Importantly, as we look across our assortment today, we don't believe we're uniquely exposed to these tariffs compared to our competitive set. In any case, our team is focused on adhering to our two core pricing tenets to remain price competitive and achieve price-cost neutrality over time, and I have full confidence in our ability to remain agile while we execute on these objectives. As D.G. mentioned at the beginning of the call, after our solid start to the year, we're reaffirming our 2025 guidance. From a tariff perspective, we've included price-cost impacts we are seeing today and assume any go-forward incremental pricing actions passed on price-cost neutral basis will be offset by lower demand. While the tariff inflation in a vacuum would provide a net tailwind to our business, it is unclear at this stage what the duration of the tariffs will be and what impact they will ultimately have on customer demand. With this, we assume these impacts will offset and are leaving our outlook unchanged, but we'll check and adjust as the year progresses. From a seasonal perspective, we expect the year-over-year sales growth will improve slightly in the second quarter, reflecting normal seasonality, and including a modest tailwind from the first wave of tariff-related pricing actions that went into effect today. Preliminary, April sales are up approximately 5.5% on a daily constant currency basis, which includes a 30 basis points headwind from the timing shift of the Good Friday holiday. All told, we expect the total company sales for the second quarter to be just north of $4.5 billion or approximately 5% on a daily constant currency basis. From a profitability perspective, there are a number of moving pieces that we know will impact second quarter results. Moving sequentially from the first quarter, we know growth margins will structurally trend downwards, generally in line with normal seasonality. We've layered in the tariff-related price and cost impact that we know of today or can reasonably expect based upon conversations we've had to date with our supplier partners. On SG&A, we expect some leverage improvement sequentially as productivity and sales leverage partially offsets increased costs. We will continue to invest in demand generation and as with every year, myriad increases went live to start the quarter. Further, as we've discussed, some expenses that were planned for the first quarter are shifting to the second, creating a sequential headwind. These items are in addition to the previously discussed noise that occurred in the first quarter from the Granger sales meeting. This impact will flip sequentially in the second quarter and become a headwind to growth margin, but an offsetting tailwind to SG&A. Taking all these moving pieces into account, we are targeting second quarter operating margin to be at or near 15% for the total company. Again, this is obviously a highly fluid environment, but we believe our outlook covers a reasonable set of potential outcomes. With that, I'll turn it back to DG.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. Overall, I'm encouraged by how the team has managed through what is a very dynamic environment and how we continue to show up for our customers every day. Before I close, I want to take one more opportunity to acknowledge the strength of the Grainger culture. Just four months into the year, we've received several recognitions. Including World's Most Admired Companies, Glassdoor's Best Places to Work, and for our first time ever, the World's Most Ethical Companies. Each of these achievements are special individually, but together, I believe they showcase why team members choose to grow their careers with Grainger. Congratulations to the team for earning these notable awards. And with that, I will open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David Manthey : Thank you. Hi, good morning. First off, let me ask about Zoro. It looked like a great quarter and terrific SG&A leverage there. Is the improvement that you're seeing there just based on stronger-than-expected sales this quarter, or are you starting to find an equilibrium between revenues and OpEx, so we continue to see a higher level of profitability there?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes, most of it is what we think is sustainable revenue growth. We're seeing nice repeat rates in the business, and that's gotten a lot better. We don't have to grow expenses with that revenue growth, given where we're at. We're in good shape to get leverage if we continue to drive that revenue growth.
David Manthey: That's great to hear. Second, you in the past said that you could achieve a 20% consolidated contribution margin at kind of a mid-single-digit rate of growth or higher. If we have this situation where volume and tariff-driven pricing net each other out, is it possible you could do that at a slightly lower rate because price is coming through at a higher contribution margin?
Deidra Merriwether: The short answer is yes, that is true. Obviously, if you don't have significant demand degradation with increased prices, then yes, we would have a lower rate of growth to get that through.
David Manthey: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Levenson with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.
Jacob Levenson : Good morning, everyone. D.G., I realize you folks have quite a broad product offering here, but can you maybe just speak to your ability to flex your sourcing, given the tariff headwinds and maybe how you're balancing that versus taking a price, especially given all the inflation we had over the past few years?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So the good news is we've done a lot of work to understand sources and alternative sources. We've already moved some things over the last few years to allow us to have a more resilient supply chain. The challenge is there are certain categories for which there are really no alternatives where everything comes from China for instance. And so, that gets harder because that takes time a lot of time in some cases to actually move somewhere else. We're talking with our own suppliers on private brand and our brand suppliers, and we're hearing people talk about potentially moving things. But it's not immediate. You know our hope is that, we don't continue to completely shutdown trade between China and the U.S. for a long period of time because obviously we wouldn't have everything we need to support our customers, we do have inventory on hand and we're doing some creative things to make sure we have the right inventory to support our customers without taking extra cost on and I think that's probably the trick right now. Our team is working very hard to make that happen
Jacob Levenson: Okay, that's helpful. Is that -- I mean does that apply to your private label offering or maybe so different ways? I assume the economics change quite a bit with the tariffs as they stand today?
Donald Macpherson: They do I mean, you know, I give you give you one hypothetical example that that plays out a lot. It depends of course whether or not the national brand and the private brand are only produced in the same location or whether there's alternatives. But in an example if a private brand product is made in China and the national brand is made in Indonesia, let's say if there's different tariffs that can change the economics and we could be in a position where the private brand doesn't really make any sense anymore in raising the price, they would actually just stop all volume. And so there are some cases like that, there's some cases that aren't like that and you have to do it on a case-by-case basis.
Jacob Levenson: Okay, that's great, thank you very much. Good luck guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair, please proceed with your question.
Ryan Merkel: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start off just high level on the macro. It sounds like you haven't seen any slowdown yet in the business just based on the guide you gave for daily sales. And then D.G. I don't know what any feedback that you found interesting when you're speaking with customers as it relates to the outlook and what people are concerned about?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, so actually we've seen as the years gone we've seen actually some accelerated growth April is our best month yet. So we haven't seen a slowdown yet. But that said, you know the way this works on the tariffs is it takes -- we have inventory obviously and it takes months for that to sort of flow through. So, we wouldn't expect to see any tariff related impact on demand yet and probably starting this quarter. We might see a little bit, but we don't think it's going to be that much and more would happen later depending on. How things shake out and there's a lot of uncertainty there. I'd say, you know, I think most customers are embedding modest tariffs into their thinking. They don't expect it to be significant trade challenges, they think they're going to be able to get product at this point, they're really focused on running their operations and keeping their people safe and doing the things that they do every day it hasn't been a lot of conversations about tariffs specifically with my customer interactions and I think that's primarily because they think this likely gets worked out some way. But nobody knows which way, so. Yes.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, and then second questions on tariffs. I just want to make sure I heard the message, right? It sounds like I made first you put through a price increase but it was only for the direct imports that you're bringing in and you're sort of waiting to see what the suppliers do and. You'll have an update on what that price increase might be, what next quarter?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, next quarter. We will what I would say is mostly just our direct imports there are a few suppliers that came with increases and we put those through as well. But generally it's on the whole it's very modest for some specific products.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Christopher Snyder with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question.
Christopher Snyder: Thank you. I'm just following up on tariffs, maybe no surprise. Did you guys -- have you guys -- did you guys provide anything in the prepared remarks just around, how much price is flowing through from what's been announced to date including, some of the early action on 232 in China and then you know what we got here on the direct imports in May? And you guys did not change the gross margin guidance, is that just an assumption that you know gross margin can be held through this period of higher cost inflation? Thank you.
Deidra Merriwether: Hey Chris. So yes, we didn't prepare -- in the prepared remarks didn't state a specific number, but we did note that we put through increases related to the tariffs mainly on imported products and D.G. just notice a few other national brand suppliers, we believe that impact will be about 1% to 1.5% net impact for us. So he noted fairly modest. And then when you look at the gross margin outlook for the year, we did a little bit better. In the first quarter, we've taken some price that we know of. We are going to continue to target price cost neutrality over time. Within that price cost neutrality, D.G. just gave an example of where in some cases, because -- and if some of these very significant tariffs sustain over a period of time, we're going to have to come back and revisit how we price our product generally. But the goal will be to achieve that price cost neutrality over time. And due to the noise and the scenarios we have run, we believe based upon the range in line with the guidance for the year that is something that we should still be able to hit. But again, more to come. We feel like we're going to learn a lot in the second quarter. More negotiations will be completed. And we'll get a read on price elasticity as well.
Christopher Snyder: Thank you. I appreciate that. And then maybe just following up on some of your commentary earlier around the benchmark, maybe not being the right benchmark at this period of time. I guess why does the company think IP is the best way to benchmark volumes? Manufacturing is only, I think, about 30% of the mix. So I just wonder, could GDP be a better benchmark to go volumes against? I mean, I wonder if some of the dislocation we're seeing between IP and GDP could be causing some of that performance. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, no, appreciate the question. So a couple of things. What's not changing? We aren't changing our expectation of what market growth is going to be this year from a volume basis. We aren't changing our revenue projection. We aren't changing the fact that we think outgrowth, particularly on a volume basis, is critical for us to be successful long term. And we aren't changing our target. But what we're seeing right now -- so historically, IP manufacturing has been, I would say, close enough. We know it's not perfect. Our internal model takes into account things like government spending, trade flows, those types of things. It's much more accurate. But it was close enough and easy for everybody to understand. What's happened here is those two have really gotten to a different place this quarter. And as we look at sort of how we're performing around the competitive set, similarly, we're seeing more positive things for us than that metric would suggest. So given the noise, we're just going to focus on the annual number. We'll get back to you. You're right. There’s probably -- we know there's a better one, we know our internal model is more accurate. We can explain it to you, but it's relatively complicated. And so we've tried to keep things simple in the past, and that's been our goal.
Christopher Snyder: Thank you. I appreciate that, D.G.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.
Tommy Moll : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. D.G., I wanted to circle back to your comments around the private label portfolio. If you think holistically there, is it relatively more tied to China? And if we do end up with persistently elevated tariffs there, how much risk to profit dollars, if any, is there to the extent you see customers, as you indicated in the example, shift away from private label to a national brand?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So I would say that certainly private brand is more China-centric than national brands, but not as much difference as you might think, actually. There's a lot of national brands that have the same China exposure in the same categories. So, the short answer is we think we can navigate around our private brands. Obviously, if this level of tariff were to persist, I think we'd get into supply challenges for big categories that are really important for our customers, and there may not be other sources. I think that's probably the biggest risk right now. If certain categories become un-cost competitive or non-cost competitive in China, I think we're going to have to look at other applications in some cases or just focus on the national brand. And I don't think it would be a huge deal overall. It would be a modest pressure, but not huge. But the issue here is going to be do we actually continue to trade effectively with China? If we do, I think we can navigate things. If we don't, there's going to be some categories that are really difficult to get our hands on.
Deidra Merriwether: Only other thing I would add is that we don't feel like we have a unique situation here. It's different for us than anyone else we're competing with. That's the only piece I would add here, Tom.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, and the other thing on that is we've looked at where we have unique exposure, and it's almost nothing. It's very, very low. And so everybody's in the same boat here for sure.
Tommy Moll: Yeah. Thank you both. D.G., in recent periods, or I should say previous periods of market volatility, Grainger has been able to capture significant market share. And there's probably a whole host of reasons for that. But just as a simple example, I'm thinking about a few years ago when the supply chain was disrupted. You were able to exploit your scale and buying power to serve customers better than some of the smaller peers, for example. But if you think about the current environment, are there new lanes that you're identifying where you can lean in and once again exploit some of the scale and sophistication that you've built over your years as CEO? Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, I think like I said before, I think we're in a good place in terms of understanding the options. I would say similar to when we went into COVID, our expectation was we're not trying to win any dip, we're trying to win through the cycle. And I think that allowed us to invest and gain share. We're talking about it similarly now. Are there ways for us to gain share coming through whatever happens here? I'd say with COVID and the supply shortages, it was pretty obvious what was going on. I'd say this is pretty uncertain still. We're probably going to let this play out for a few more months to understand really what the rules of the game are. But certainly I do feel like we will be in good position to drive some share gain through this process.
Tommy Moll: Thank you. I'll turn it back.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Cooke with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Cooke : Morning, and thank you for taking my question today. Maybe we could just touch on some of the moving pieces in your guide. I understand that you left the high-level framework unchanged, but I'm curious if there's been any push and pull between HTS and EA coming out of the quarter, and also if you could just help parse out price versus volume expectations. I think you had said earlier in Q&A that market volume outlook remains unchanged, but presumably you'd be looking at no longer be looking at minimal price for the year? So maybe if you could just touch on that.
Deidra Merriwether: Yes, so you're correct in the fact that there are a lot of moving pieces, which is one of the reasons when we looked at scenarios, the pieces were moving so much, whether it was gross margin, the revenue outlook, the price that we could actually feel certain about at this point in time, and then the leverage that we could probably drive for the rest of the year. We actually zoomed out and just said, okay, let's look at our seasonal trends. Let's base our outlook and guide, if we're going to look at it, on what we actually know and can understand, and that got us back to really holding the guide that we had laid out earlier in the year. There are some pieces, as you know, FX has moved a little bit differently, but we started off the year well, which helps us put a quarter of that in the bank. Gross margin was stable, and we're on our way to pass price and attempt to reach neutrality on the things that we actually knew. So that helps from a GP perspective. You call out that EA did really well, and it is growing faster than the high-touch business, which generally, at those margin rates, creates a headwind for us. But again, we were not necessarily incorporating potentially some of the upside that we may see from price over time, and so those things kind of canceled themselves out. So I guess the point I would like you to walk away with is we understand the dynamics of the business and what could happen. We have modeled several scenarios, including EA continuing to move fast and grow well in this market, but also I will point you back to some of our original assumptions related to the market. We knew that the administration was going to pass tariffs. We couldn't size them, but we did estimate that the market would most likely be down from a volume perspective or flat, and it looks like it is playing out that way. And so we've kept that assumption in mind as well. So again, we feel like we're at a good place. Any incremental price, we feel like we're going to be able to pass on as long as it's not too significant. But since we have been through several cycles of pretty high inflation, at some point that's going to start to impact demand, and we're thinking about that and being conservative as we think about the rest of the year.
Ryan Cooke: That's very clear. Thank you, Dee. And FX was actually going to be my next question, so it sounds like there could be a little upside there given moves in the dollar, but okay. So I guess for my second question, we've covered a lot of ground on pricing and tariffs. Maybe if you could just touch on health of the customer groups and any notable trends that you'd highlight. I know government's a chunky exposure for you, so are we still seeing kind of no impact from DOGE or stimulus rollback there?
Donald Macpherson: No. What I'd say is we're seeing all kinds of impacts at a sub-segment level. There were markets that were very, very strong in the quarter. Your specific comment on government, we think it was relatively weak to start the year. And we're not as exposed to DOGE given we're mostly military and state, but the little bit of business that we have, it would be exposed. Certainly, that was a little slower, so we did see that. But net-net, there's nothing. There's a lot of movements, but nothing dramatic to really describe at this point. I would say certain manufacturing segments were very, very strong. Aerospace is an example. It was very strong in the quarter. But other than that, not much to really talk about.
Ryan Cooke: Okay. Appreciate the color. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Going to page 12 and the pie chart on the geographic mix, I would have thought China was much higher. And so has that changed meaningfully, let's say, in the last five years? And then also, how does that mix look differently versus your channel partners versus private label? Maybe I was thinking the private label is a much higher China source.
Donald Macpherson: The private label is much -- yes, that's right. The private label is much higher China source. This is sort of end production location as well. So what's to note about this? This is sort of the end production COGS by region. Certainly, there will be some componentry that we don't capture in our branded product that comes from China. So that number will be higher when we look at that. We know some of that. We don't know all of that. So this is just end production at this point. And actually, China has gone down a little bit over the last several years. Not fast, but it has gone down a little bit. There's been a shift to Vietnam, as an example, for some categories. Mexico has picked up a little bit.
Deane Dray: All right, good. That was really helpful. And D.G., I know you were dismissive last quarter that there might be any pre-positioning by customers ahead of tariffs. It doesn't appear like that happened. But was interested if you all have done anything differently in terms of sourcing volumes ahead of tariffs. It doesn't look like it in your free cash flow. But just have you been tempted to try to get out in front of any of this? But some color there would be great.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, not much. We placed pretty strong orders for Chinese New Year to make sure we got service right and got out in front of service on private brand products. And then we're doing some things for things that were on the water, for example, to hold them so that we don't take them at a depleted cost, but we still have them accessible when we need them for customers. So we are doing some things. But generally, we haven't done that much that would show up.
Deane Dray: Great. And just last one is an observation. I appreciate all of your candor and the outgrowth, kind of the consternation between the two models. And as much as I would love to have real-time outgrowth updates from you all, getting an annual number, I think, is fine. And it would be great if you could revisit those differences at year-end. But we appreciate it.
Donald Macpherson: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sabrina Abrams with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Sabrina Abrams : Hey, good morning. Hey, thank you. Thanks for the question. I'm going to go back to the price and tariffs. So I guess, I think, Dee, you mentioned that it was 1% to 1.5% net impact in 2Q. And I guess I'm just curious. So I understand, like, maybe it's not all, you haven't raised prices on everything at this point based on the tariffs. But just, like, if I think about the China COGS and the percentage of China imports to the U.S., I think I get to, with the 145% tariff, I think I get to a very robust price increase, like something in, like, the mid-teens level. And I guess just curious how to sort of bridge from the 1% to 1.5% to what's implied just by, like, China alone and, like, the mid-to-high teens. And I guess, like, yes, just thinking about, like, the different, I guess, like, getting from 1% to 1.5%, maybe it goes higher in the second half, and how to think about, like, the price increases on China. And, like, if, you know, the tariffs do stay in place, like, do we see pricing reach, like, 16%, 17%, 20% plus in your business? Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So just as a reminder, the tariffs that we took were on direct imports, meaning our own private brands mostly. We took a few increases on national brand product, but mostly it was our own product. And that's a relatively smaller portion of the product. And certainly some of those products did increase into the mid-teens. That is true. But as a percent of the whole, that's pretty small. And so that's where you get the 1% to 1.5% now. If -- and this does not contemplate any of the 145%. Obviously, that is a different thing altogether. And if we had to price that in, if our suppliers had to price it in, it would be quite a change. And so right now, the behavior we're seeing for our suppliers, they know that if they take the prices up that much, we're not going to sell anything in some cases. And so we're working through, basically we're working through what's going to happen and how we're going to handle that. But so far, it's been relatively modest.
Sabrina Abrams: Thank you. That makes sense. And then could you just provide a little more color on the price-cost dynamics through the year? I think there's a comment on the slide about being lumpy, but just want to understand expectations around price cost in 2Q and sort of how that cadence trends through the year?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes, thanks for the question. And so, you know, just, I will say I continue what D.G. started with. At the highest level, you know, there's a lot of noise in the news about inflation. However, on the ground, things are moving a whole lot slower. And so the reason why we took the step to take the increases that we did is because those are more known. They've been negotiated. And, some of those standard costs in our system are being changed and thus the price is being changed. And so we did layer in this first pass of price inflation, and that will have an impact, a slight impact because it is modest on the second quarter. But there's a lot of puts and takes related to, I would say, price, gross margin and profitability as we go from Q1 to Q2. As you know, from Q1 to Q2, structurally gross margin uses, usually trends downward in the second quarter. We layered on the tariff from that perspective. And then SG&A, there's also quite a bit of noise. We expect to gain some leverage as we move sequentially from Q1 to Q2. And in the prepared remarks, I noted that some of the favorability from Q1 SG&A flows into Q2. So that'll be a headwind. And then we have this noise with Grainger sales meeting that also impacts us both on gross margin and operating margins. So I wanted to point everyone to the fact that we expected for the second quarter operating margin to be about 15% because it is so noisy. It's kind of hard to follow all the noise and some of the things straight through. But as you think about the rest of the year, if tariffs remain modest as we continue to work through negotiations, we feel like we'll be able to manage that from a price-cost perspective. There may be some timing differences, but we will provide you that insight as we do on a quarter basis on how things are trending. And we feel like the overall guide still holds intact from an operating margin range, including operating cash flow and some of our other expenditures like CapEx share repurchase and the announced dividend that we just had.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer Company. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn : Yes, thanks. Good morning and afternoon. So going back to the Zoro strength, I know it's in a different growth zip code from HTS, but the spread of growth is pretty unique historically. So I'm just curious. If we were in like a 3% to 4% HTS environment, would you be expecting Zoro to be putting up 25% to 30%? Is there a multiplier on end-market increments to the upside?
Donald Macpherson: No. What I would say is I generally focus on different end markets. And so Zoro's growth is typically its ability to acquire high-quality customers that are more midsize and smaller and then to get them to repeat. And most of their growth, frankly, is in their hands. And so it really isn't linked to High-Touch given -- High-Touch is focused on more industrial, larger customers with all kinds of added services. Zoro is a business that's very much a marketing-focused business. I'm trying to gain share with those midsize and smaller companies.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, great. Any other questions for the U.S. D.G.? Any interesting divergences geographically, regions within the U.S.?
Donald Macpherson: No, not that we've seen. We haven't seen anything really all that interesting there.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, thank you. My other questions have been asked.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katie Fleischer with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Katie Fleischer : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I just have one question here. Is there any way to quantify the amount of price increase requests that you have gotten from your suppliers and how long that will take to flow through to the P&L?
Donald Macpherson: So we probably won't talk about the amount of increased requests. They've been all over the map, I will say that. So we've had some very high and some modest ones. Flowing through the P&L, though, I think is an interesting question. We typically have, let's say, three months' worth of inventory already. And so it does take a while for this to flow through. We have to place the orders, receive the orders for the cost to change. And so it will take some time. We will see a little bit of that in the second quarter, but I'd say more of it in the third quarter and beyond. We'll start to see that flow through.
Katie Fleischer: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Patrick Baumann with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Baumann : Hi. Good morning. On the comparison of branded versus private label product, is there a rule of thumb or an average where your private label competes with a branded product? Like what percent discount in price the private label brand is to the branded product? And then what the difference is in gross margin between them? And then in terms of -- I know you've probably looked at this very detailed, is there a percentage risk that you're thinking about as a percentage of your private label portfolio that's sourced from China that would be non-competitive if the tariffs held at the 145% number?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So what I would say is that you have to do this on an individual product basis. In some cases, our private brands have a modest cost advantage. And if the tariffs are big, they will be underwater immediately. And in that case, though, the GP between the private brand and the national brand isn't actually that big of a difference. So that'll be an impact but not a huge impact. There's some huge cost differences between private brand and national brand. In those cases, we may end up taking the increase and GP may be smaller on those products in that case. So far, the cost increases that we, price increases we put through on those cost increases, we've been able to pass those through. And I think that'll make sense. Like I said before, if the 145% were to sustain, then that's where you're going to have some issues where we probably affect gross margin in the short term potentially.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. And then in looking at your comment on slide 12, again, back to that slide where you mentioned that total COGS isn't subject to the full tariff increase resulting in net inflation being lower for Grainger. Can you help us understand how much of your COGS is product and input costs versus some of those other buckets like freight supplier markup, other costs that maybe won't be subject to the tariffs?
Deidra Merriwether: We don't give all of those details, but some of the things that we have talked about in the past that I think are fair to reiterate is that freight as a percent of COGS is generally in the mid to high single digits for us. But this is the detailed work that we've done to be able to understand that. And by and large, you could assume that the product piece is the majority of the impact. But as D.G. noted, you really have to go through product by product costs and then composition of the product to really get to the tariff amount. And I know it's hard for you all to attempt to model this, but it's also difficult for us and as well as our supplier partners to get to the right answer here. And that's why we're really -- our teams are really taking a very measured approach. And I really appreciate that our supplier partners are doing that as well with us. And then we're also trying to partner on the other end with customers to help them understand that, you know, we have much more knowledge.
Patrick Baumann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I turn the floor back to Mr. McPherson for any final comments.
Donald Macpherson: So thanks for joining us today. We spent a lot of time talking about tariffs and while we don't know where those are going to shake out, I just would reiterate that our business is focused on making sure we can serve our customers well, protect service and work with our partners effectively to get to the right outcome here. We will be thoughtful. We will not react too quickly and we'll get to the best answer. We feel like we've got a good position given our product information, our understanding of sources and some of the things we've evaluated in the past help us have a good position heading into this. But this is all about making sure we can serve our customers effectively and protect service and do that in a financially proven way. So I want to thank everybody on our team and our suppliers for helping us with this. And thanks for joining us today and take care. Have a great weekend.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-31 05:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Kyle Bland, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC. This morning's presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures, which include certain adjustments in previous periods as noted in the presentation. There were no adjusted items in the fourth quarter 2024 period. Definitions and full reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers discussed will differ from MonotaRO's public statements. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you, Kyle. Good morning and thanks for joining the call. In 2024, the Grainger team continued to drive our strategy forward by remaining focused on what matters most: providing our customers with exceptional service and a great experience. On these core issues, we made strong progress this past year. We leveraged our technology data and analytical capabilities to drive differentiated value for our customers in those segments. We invested in supply chain capacity to extend our leadership position in MRO fulfillment. And we remain focused on fostering a workplace environment where all team members can build a rewarding career. These efforts allowed us to deliver on our financial commitments for the year and helped us maintain our track record of driving strong return for shareholders. I'm proud of the progress we've made and want to take a few minutes to highlight some of these accomplishments in more detail. To start, I'd like to ground us in the understanding that all MRO distributors are trying to solve 2 basic customer needs. First, customers expect to fall as experience. That means having the products they need, making it simple to find, having a seamless order process, getting into them quickly and making it easy to receive and pay. Second, customers expect their MRO partner to deliver tangible value for their business. This goes far beyond selling products and is something that shows up differently for each customer. It could be simplifying a customer's purchasing process, helping them improve inventory management capabilities, finding product substitutes to save them money or supporting their operational and safety challenges. Our 2 go-to-market models, High-Touch Solutions and Endless Assortment, are built to solve these needs for customers of varying sizes and industries. Our teams and processes are structured to help customers find the products they need, buy it with confidence and deliver it next day and complete. We do this while minimizing complexity and showcasing our value-added capabilities that are relevant to their context. To do this well and at scale, we continue to build upon our 3 core foundational competencies. These are leveraging our technology and data capabilities to extend our digital advantage, expanding our supply chain footprint to maintain industry-leading service, and building and cultivating a highly engaged team. Let me briefly touch on each of these. Over the last several years, we have invested heavily to building market-leading data and technology capabilities, including developing proprietary product information and customer information systems. These data assets underpin our 5 strategic growth engines and fuel our ability to gain share within our High-Touch Solutions segment. In 2024, we made some great progress. Within merchandising, we have completed a first pass review to our full assortment. This is a tremendous milestone, and I'm proud of the continuous improvement mindset the team has taken to advance and standardize the process with this evergreen initiative. We'll continue to review categories, and we'll likely see more net assortment growth going forward as we add products to meet evolving customer needs. Our marketing team is focused on driving continued strong returns on our ad spend. In 2024, we expanded our top-of-funnel marketing efforts in new channels to increase brand awareness. We also iterated on our digital marketing strategy to best capture in-the-moment demand. Further, we're finding new ways to utilize our PIM and KIM data assets to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our spend. We have seen positive results in many areas and plan to continue to increase our overall marketing investment again in 2025. We continue to leverage our improved customer data to expand our sales force, adding one new geography and around 70 new sellers in 2024 as part of our sales coverage initiative. We slowed our investment in this space in 2024 and to start this year, but we continue to be pleased with our results and expect to add 1 or 2 more geographies later in 2025. Our sales force remains our biggest demand generator, and we are investing in 2 resources to increase their effectiveness and help them better serve our customers. We built and launched a proprietary sellers insight tool that integrates with other Grainger platforms to serve customer-specific insights. This helps our sellers save time and enables more productive customer conversations. And just this week, we are conducting intensive training for our sellers to help them meet their customer needs. Helping our sellers succeed will always be a focus. Within customer solutions, we implemented new homegrown software across our KeepStock platform to enhance our inventory management capabilities. And we are piloting new customer-facing tools, which will provide access to enhanced data and insights. These advancements will help improve the user experience and drive procurement cost savings for our customers. All told, there's plenty of runway across our growth engines to continue powering share into the future. The information advantage we built across product and customer information also unlocks our ability to tap into new and emerging technologies to better serve customers and extend our leadership position in the MRO industry. We're leveraging our proprietary data to find new ways to increase revenue, drive efficiencies and enhance service. We've been developing a variety of different capabilities across the business, including homegrown machine learning, large language models and data tools where we can add incremental value. We are also piloting off-the-shelf technologies to help streamline back-office processes. To brings this to life, we've included a few examples. In KeepStock, we're leveraging computer vision to streamline our install process. Here, a cell phone camera can extract and codify detailed product information to help reduce errors and better organize the layout for the new install. This saves meaningful time for our KeepStock team members, lowering install cost while improving the customer experience. Our inventory team has been augmented their planning algorithms of advanced machine learning models to optimize the depth and breadth of products across each market. These new models have been implemented across most of our North American network, driving service-level improvements. Going forward, the team sees opportunities across supply chain to further refine our planning capabilities, helping us extend our service lead and optimize asset efficiency. Finally, as mentioned last quarter, we're testing a generative AI model in our call centers, which leverages our proprietary product and customer information to craft well-informed responses to customer chat inquiries. This tool allows us to scale our know-how and equip our customer service agents with vast relevant responses to help customers get what they need more quickly and efficiently. We're still in the test phase here, but AutoStore technical product specialists have found it to be highly accurate while providing near-term -- near-immediate response times. Down the road, this tool could be applied to other customer interaction channels. We're also investigating how this underlying technology could support other use cases across the business. We are just scratching the surface on how we can continue to leverage our data and these next-gen tools to develop advantage across the business. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in 2024 and for what's to come in 2025 and beyond. Moving to Endless Assortment. We made great progress within the segment and continue to propel the flywell forward. At Zoro, the team made significant progress on expanding their marketing efforts, growing the assortment and enhancing the customer experience. This includes leveraging data and analytics to optimize the on-site search algorithm and improve delivery communication and capabilities. Result has been a steady flow of user acquisitions, improved B2B customer retention and a return to double-digit sales growth as we exited the year. MonotaRO continues to execute exceptionally well, driving strong results, including 29% growth with enterprise customers. The business continued to see strong retention rates while deepening our share of wallet with core B2B customers. We are actively sharing learnings across these businesses and are excited to build on our momentum in 2025. Our supply chain is foundational to driving a great customer experience. We build our supply chain to specifically serve B2B customers with ship-next-day complete orders. We've made significant progress on enhancing our service capabilities and expanding our distribution center network. This includes beginning construction on the new Houston area DC, continued progress at our new Northwest DC and further investments in bulk warehouse capacity, including a roughly $80 million facility in Illinois that we purchased at the end of 2024. Across the network, we see opportunity for automation and other advancements, which will help drive further efficiencies and ensure the long-term resilience of our supply chain. As we invest in this space, we remain focused on maintaining our leading service advantage now and into the future. Our last foundational competency is our people. At the core of our success is our more than 26,000 team members who live our purpose-driven culture. Our team members are resolute and fulfilling our purpose. We keep the world working and living our principles because we know the work we do matters. This is how we get the best out of our talent and operate with the highest ethics and integrity. Our company remains an employer of choice as evidenced by being certified at Great Place to Work across North America and Panama. Additionally, this year, we were named a top-rank company across all industries on the American Opportunity Index, which primarily focuses on the experiences of workers in noncollege degree roles and the company's ability to offer them growth and development no matter their career path. These recognitions are a testament to our culture, including our commitment to ensure all team members could have a meaningful and fulfilling career here at Grainger. Lastly, I'd like to thank our team members for the critical role they played in helping their communities through numerous natural disasters over the past year. This includes ongoing support for customers in local and federal relief agencies across Los Angeles area as they continue to battle the devastating fires. Now turning to our peer financials. The demand environment remained sluggish throughout 2024, where we finished the year with over $17.2 billion in sales, up 4.2% on a reported basis or up 4.7% on a daily organic constant currency basis. Growth for the year included profitable share gain from our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business, which finished the year with roughly 100 basis points of total market outgrowth, including 325 basis points of outgrowth on a volume basis. In Endless Assortment, the segment showed significant top line improvement with daily constant currency sales up 11.6%. Both Zoro and MonotaRO continue to win with their core B2B customer base and drive improved repeat purchase rates, positioning them well for the future. Alongside the solid top line, the team also did a great job delivering continued strong margin performance, all while investing for the future with operating margin finishing at 15.5% for the year. Together, these results fueled strong earnings with adjusted EPS up over 6% to $38.96 per share. ROIC finished at 41.6%. And operating cash flows over $2.1 billion, which allowed us to return $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, I'm proud of what we accomplished in 2024 and know we are working on the right initiatives to remain the MRO market leader for years to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Dee to review our fourth quarter results.
Deidra Merriwether: I want to echo D.G.'s comment on our strong 2024 performance. Not only did we make progress on a number of strategic initiatives, but the team was also able to deliver on the majority of our 2024 financial commitments. This includes revenue, margin and EPS all finishing within the original guidance ranges we provided this time last year. Now turning to detail on the fourth quarter. We had another good quarter to finish out the year with results coming roughly in line with expectations. For the total company, daily sales grew 4.2% or 4.7% on a daily organic constant currency basis, which included growth in both segments. Sales were strong in the quarter despite softness in the back half of December from holiday timing and customer shutdowns. Total company gross margins for the quarter were strong, ending at 39.6%, up 50 basis points over the prior year period. Favorability was mainly driven by the High-Touch Solutions segment, which I'll detail on the next slide. This gross margin favorability largely flow through to the bottom line, where operating margins ended the quarter at 15%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.71, which was up over 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Diving into segment-level results. The High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 4% on a reported basis or 3% on a daily organic constant currency basis. Results were driven by solid volume growth and continued improved price contribution within the segment. We also delivered growth across all geographies in the period in local days, local currency. In the U.S. specifically, we saw strong growth with government and health care customers, which helped to offset more sluggish performance across the other areas. For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at a strong 42.3%, up 90 basis points versus prior year. Favorability was aided by a roughly 50 basis point lap of year-end inventory cost adjustment in the prior year as well as slight mix and freight favorability in the current year period. Price/cost for the quarter was roughly neutral. Operating margin for the segment finished the quarter at 17%, which was up 60 basis points versus the prior year. Gross margin favorability in the segment more than offset incremental investment in demand-generating activities in the period. Despite the December top line softness, it was a good finish to the year for the High-Touch Solutions segment. Turning to market outgrowth on Slide 16. Using our total market model, which includes both producer price index and industrial production inputs, we estimate that Grainger took approximately 100 basis points of total share gain in the fourth quarter. As you can see on the slide, this helped us finish full year 2024 with roughly 100 basis points of mathematical share gain in total as our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business grew 3.3% organically compared to our total MRO market model, which was up between 2% and 2.5% for the year. Pulling apart the model at the bottom of the slide, we drove approximately 325 basis points of volume outgrowth for the year. This growth was offset by a mathematical share loss from price of roughly 225 basis points as the PPI sub-index we use in the market model inflated meaningfully higher than Grainger's price contribution to revenue. As we've discussed all year, our mathematical share gain has been impacted by differences in product and customer mix between our business and the underlying mix that contributes to the PPI and IP sub-indices we use as the price and volume inputs to our market model. On price specifically, the dislocation is more dramatic on products that are experiencing high inflation in the current environment, such as airplanes and medical equipment. These products are contributing to higher market inflation than what Grainger is seeing on MRO-specific products. While the total market model remains highly correlated to our performance over time, this period of dislocation has persisted for several quarters. Our focus as a company has been and is to remain price-competitive and grow share via volume-based initiatives. With this and given the recent outsized dislocation we've seen in the price/cost component, we will be focusing our market measurement on just the volume component going forward. While the volume component of the model can still have dislocations due to its aggregated and broad nature, we feel it captures the essence of the underlying MRO activity and will serve as a good benchmark for our performance over time. On price, we have several internal and external signals that can be used to ensure that we are remaining price-competitive, and our ability to do this well can be better monitored through our gross margin results. We will continue to break out our High-Touch revenue between volume and price in the appendix of these materials each quarter as we pivot to the volume-based view. So with these changes, if you turn to Slide 17, you can see our goal for review of volume-only outgrowth, which ties back to the 325 basis points of volume contribution from the previous slide for the full year of 2024. This metric still reflects some mix-related dislocation, but much less after removing the undue noise from the price component. Overall, we remain confident in our strategic growth engines and their ability to drive share over the long term and continue to target 400 to 500 basis points of average annual outgrowth over time. Turning to the Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 15.1% or 13.2% on a daily constant currency basis. Zoro U.S. was up 13.9%, while MonotaRO achieved 14.3% growth in local days, local currency. At a business level, Zoro's growth rate continued to ramp as they have all year. The business saw strong traction across all customer types, including growth in the teens within their core B2B customer group. For the quarter, B2C and B2C-like customers grew roughly in line with core B2B, a trend we expect to be reasonably consistent going forward. At MonotaRO, sales growth remained strong with enterprise customers, coupled with solid acquisition and repeat purchase rates with core small and midsized businesses. On profitability, operating margins for the segment increased by 80 basis points to 8.6% with both businesses contributing year-over-year. Zoro operating margins were up 140 basis points to 3.7%, aided by continued operating leverage. At MonotaRO, margins remained strong at 12.6% with DC operating efficiencies driving continued year-over-year improvement. Overall, we're proud of the improved performance through 2024 within the segment and look to continue momentum this year. Now moving to our 2025 guidance. Our outlook for the year includes revenue to be between $17.6 billion and $18.1 billion at the total company level driven by growth in both segments. This translates to daily constant currency sales growth between 4% and 6.5%. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily constant currency sales of between 2.5% and 4.5%. In the U.S., we expect market volume growth for the full year to remain muted. This is consistent with what we're seeing in the current short-cycle environment and does not assume a step-change macro recovery that some are projecting for the back half of the year. On share gain, we will continue to target 400 to 500 basis points of U.S. market volume outgrowth over time. However, we expect to land in the low end of the range in 2025 from continued measurement dislocation due to mix and as we check and adjust our marketing and seller expansion efforts to incorporate learnings. Lastly, we anticipate minimal pricing inflation for the year, which is in line with what we're hearing from suppliers and seeing in the market for MRO-specific products. This assumption excludes any impact from incremental tariffs that may or may not occur in 2025. In the Endless Assortment segment, we anticipate daily constant currency sales to grow between 11% and 15%. This segment-level growth will be roughly 325 basis points lower on a reported basis when you normalize for expected foreign currency exchange headwinds and fewer selling days in the current year period. At the business unit level, Zoro is anticipated to grow in the low double digits as they continue their momentum in driving higher repeat rates, consistent service and improve target marketing. MonotaRO is expected to grow in the low teens at the midpoint in local days and local currency, which normalizes for 3 less selling days in 2025, and expected FX headwinds from the yen. This strong performance is fueled by growth with new and enterprise customers, alongside strong repeat rates with their core B2B customers. Moving to our margin expectations. We expect total company operating margins to remain strong in 2025, ranging between 15.1% and 15.5%. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, operating margins are expected to stay healthy but will contract slightly to be between 17% and 17.4%. This is driven by relatively stable gross margins, although they may tick down slightly off a strong finish to 2024. We expect SG&A will modestly delever at the midpoint on a softer top line and continued investment across our growth engines. In Endless Assortment, we anticipate operating margin will continue to ramp between 8.5% and 9%, up 20 to 70 basis points versus 2024. Slight gross margin headroom at Zoro from continued growth of lower-margin, third-party shipped SKUs will be offset by continued operating leverage at both business units as the flywheel continues to drive new customer growth and repeat purchase rates. Turning to capital allocation. We expect the business will continue to generate strong cash flow in the year with an expected range of $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion, implying operating cash conversion north of 100%. [Indiscernible] We plan to continue to execute a consistent return-driven approach to our capital allocation strategy, meaning our priorities remain largely unchanged from prior years. We'll continue to invest in the business and expect CapEx in the range of $450 million to $550 million. Spending here includes further supply chain investment as we progress with the construction of our new DC capacity. We also plan to advance our data and technology capabilities, helping to further our customers. Alongside these organic investments, we continue to explore inorganic opportunities to help further strategy or advance our capabilities. We plan to remain highly selective here in 2025. Outside investment, we expect to return the balance of our excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We'll formally set our 2025 dividend in the second quarter, but again, anticipate consistent annual dividend increases in the high single digit to low double-digit percentage range. On share repurchases, we anticipate the amount for 2025 will be between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion. As in prior years, we feel this return-focused allocation philosophy provides the organization optimal flexibility to efficiently manage investment while maximizing shareholder returns now and into the future. In summary, at the total company level, we plan to grow top line by roughly 4% to 6.5% on a daily constant currency basis. Note that reported sales growth is roughly 130 basis points lower than our daily constant currency range as we're normalizing for FX headwinds and 1 fewer selling day in the current year. A reconciliation of these impacts is provided in the appendix of this presentation. Gross margin and operating margin, as we discussed, will remain healthy for the year, leading to an expected EPS growth of flat to up 6.5% or $39 to $41.50 per share. Note, this expected EPS growth range includes a $20 million net interest headwind in 2025 following our debt refinancing and expected lower interest rates on our cash balances. Further, there is roughly 110 basis point year-over-year headwind to our EPS growth rate as our effective tax rate normalizes in 2025 after the onetime benefit we captured in 2024. From a seasonality perspective, we expect sales to start slower and ramp as we move through the year. This includes a softer start in January from the timing of the New Year's holiday and the cold weather disruptions experienced during the month. With this, January sales started slow but picked up momentum as the month progressed with preliminary results up approximately 2.5% on a daily constant currency basis. January growth will be approximately 100 basis points higher if you normalize for the holiday and weather impacts. When translating daily constant currency sales to reported revenue, there's a lot of noise this year, particularly in the first quarter. This is driven by foreign exchange headwinds, which are most announced in Q1, before subsiding in the middle of the year. There's also 1 fewer selling day in February, which reduces revenue by roughly $70 million year-over-year, representing a 160 basis point headwind to reported sales growth in the first quarter. All in, this translates to expected reported sales of around $4.3 billion for the first quarter of 2025. On profitability, given the slower start to sales and 1 less selling day in the current year period, operating margin rates will be challenged in the first quarter before ramping through the year. This deviates from our normal seasonal pattern, and we won't see the price timing favorability we normally capture in Q1 given the low-cost inflation environment we're experiencing this year. With this, first quarter operating margins will be closer to the bottom of our 2025 full year guidance range around 15%. This will drive year-over-year EPS growth to be flat to slightly down in the first quarter and will ramp thereafter as the year continues. Lastly, we're reiterating the core tenets of our long-term earnings framework, including continued strong top line growth comprised of 400 to 500 basis points of annual volume outgrowth in the High-Touch U.S. business and annual revenue growth in the teens for Endless Assortment, generally stable gross profit margins within each segment, and SG&A growing slower than sales over time while still investing in demand-generating activities to drive sustainable long-term growth. Executing against these tenets to drive double-digit EPS growth under normal market conditions. Combining this with our balanced capital allocation strategy, we think this represents an attractive return profile that can drive significant value creation for shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. In 2024, our team members showed up every day, living Grainger's purpose and putting the customer first, leading the strong results for the company. As we head into 2025, I'm confident durable advantage will allow us to continue to gain share and create strong returns for all stakeholders. With that, we'll open the line up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens.
Tommy Moll: D.G., I wanted to start with a question on the new volume-based outgrowth metric that you've provided. So the 400 to 500, I believe, is unchanged from the prior framework. If we look at 2024, you were a little bit below the low end of that range. And I think the guidance for this year contemplates being around the low end of that range. So to the extent you can bridge us on those 2 years what the headwinds were and what keeps you confident in that 400 to 500 million longer term, that would be appreciated.
Donald Macpherson: Sure. Thank you. So first of all, the biggest dislocation has been on the price component, and we actually hit that. There's some product categories that we don't actually play in that have had more price inflation. So we felt like moving to the volume metric made the most sense. We were lower than the 400 for 2024. There was still dislocation, we believe, in the volume metric as well. And I will say that this metric does get restated as well at that point looking forward. So we have found that we may have done better than we've stated here that is possible. So the 400 -- you see 400, 450, 450 moving forward. The 400 is really a nod to the fact that we found that when we expanded seller coverage, if we went with too many sellers at one time in a region, we struggled to hit the execution we wanted. So we scaled that back a little bit and only had one region of 70 new sellers in 2024, and we're going in smaller chunks moving forward. So that slows down that metric a little bit for this coming year. But basically, nothing has really changed in reality.
Tommy Moll: And as a follow-up, D.G., I wanted to ask about what's assumed in your outlook this year on government spend. And I mention that just because there's plenty in the headlines these days about potential headwinds there. And so as you put together your outlook for this year, I'm just curious what assumptions you made.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. We obviously have a strong government business. I would remind everybody that the vast majority of -- the majority of that is actually state and local government. So federal government is a smaller portion. Of the federal government portion, military is by far the biggest chunk. And we do very well in serving the military. And we don't think that's going to be affected much, and it may actually be a positive potentially. So we don't have a huge impact in there right now from some of the government changes given where we play. And we obviously are constantly looking at regulations and making sure we understand what's going on. We feel pretty good about our federal business and our state and local business at this point.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.
Ryan Merkel: My first question is just on the outlook for '25. You've got the market volume down 1%. Can you just talk about some of the assumptions you've made? And did you include anything for tariff uncertainty in that outlook?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. I'll start with that. So yes, we're assuming that the U.S. MRO volume portion of the market will be flat to down 1.5%. And if you think about that at the midpoint, that is about where we, I believe, 2024 was. And so we're really not expecting, like some are, a macro step-change in the year. So we're assuming 2025 is going to be like 2024 at this point. And then to the second part of your question, since the landscape around tariffs is so uncertain and changing rapidly and daily, we chose to not include any tariff-related impacts in the guide at this point. And as more is known and we understand it and can work with our supply base, we, of course, will run that through our numbers. And if an adjustment is needed, we will do that at the next time we speak with you.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And I think that's fair. And then my second question is just on the opportunity with AI. And thanks for the extra detail in the deck, I'm looking at Page 7 here. I guess, D.G., this may be hard to answer because it's early, but should we view AI as potentially transformative for Grainger or is that a bit strong? Maybe it's just another tool in the toolbox to help you outgrow?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I think the way I view the AI tools is the powerful set of tools that can help make the business better and really important to point the effort at the right issues for the company and define processes that will benefit from AI. It's also really important to have data. If you don't have the right data, right data feed, you can get some junk out. And so we've been investing in those data assets with PIM and KIM over the last several years. And we've also invested in understanding how best to use AI, and we're experimenting and learning about where it plays best. We've been using ML, which is a part of AI for a long time. And we have made something like 18 working models in the business that run all kinds of things. So this is not really new to us. We do think some of the tools will be -- give us an advantage in certain areas given our data quality and the amount of data we have. I'd leave it there.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sabrina Abrams with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sabrina Abrams: So I'm also going to ask a question about the volume target. So I see the slide that lays out the framework, the shift from 4 to 5 target to be about volume outgrowth rather than the total market. Just to clarify, are there any changes to how you're thinking about your gross margin or your operating margin or the EPS CAGR long-term targets given the shift in the outgrowth target?
Donald Macpherson: No. No, there's no changes at all. In fact, the outgrowth target is still the same, too. So really, there's no change in anything or our confidence about the earnings algorithm going forward. Nothing's changed.
Sabrina Abrams: Okay. Great. And then as we think about the margin ramp through the year, I guess, how should I think about the drivers of margin, maybe at the bottom of Q1 and then ramping through the year? Just like looking at it, I think the price comps are more difficult in the back half, at least for U.S. HTS. So what sort of drives the improvement off of Q1?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. So let me take it back a little bit, and I'll start with sales and I'll end with profitability because there is a little bit of noise, especially in Q1. And so as I mentioned on the call for the first quarter, we feel like we've had a slow start, and that will flow through the P&L, mostly due to January results and holiday timing and some adverse weather. And so that's going to also impact the first quarter. And so when you translate daily constant currency sales to reported sales, there's a lot of noise in the first quarter. And that's driven by foreign exchange headwinds, which are most pronounced again in the first quarter. And also in the first quarter, there's 1 fewer selling day in February, which reduces revenue roughly by about $70 million, representing about 160 basis points headwind to reported sales. And that all translates to the number that we provided in prepared remarks that we believe our reported sales for the quarter were in about $4.3 billion, around that area, for the first quarter. And so we don't -- from there, we're still not going to have typical seasonality with the business because generally, in the first quarter, we raised price more significantly. We've noted that price will be minimal in the fourth quarter -- first quarter, so you're not going to have the change sequentially from Q1 to Q2. So I wanted to call that out as well. And given the slower start to sales when you include the FX impacts as well as the daily sales count, operating margin in Q1 will be about the lowest of the year, and we kind of said that in the prepared remarks as well. We think it's going to land around 15 for the full year guidance range. This will drive EPS down to be flat to slightly down in the first quarter, and then that will also ramp thereafter.
Donald Macpherson: Basically, it's because of the sales impact. And basically, that's the whole game here in the first quarter. There's some strange things going on with sales and FX.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: D.G., just to follow on to what you just said, question on contribution margins, I guess, not just in the first quarter but more holistically for the year. At what rate would you expect unexpected incremental volume revenue dollars, so not tariffs or anything like that, but revenue dollars that were unexpected to flow through to EBIT and, let's say, that's manifested in the market growing 2% rather than flat to down 1.5%?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean we would expect -- if you're saying if we get better market conditions, north of 20% would be some of the incremental margins.
David Manthey: Yes. Okay. And then just one for Dee quickly. As we look at Slide 23 and we're bridging from the EBIT to the EPS, I know you have these below-the-line items for noncontrolling and allocation of participating securities. Could you just tell us what your rough estimate is for that? Is it $95 million, $96 million, something like that?
Deidra Merriwether: Let me get to the slide. You said Slide 23? Yes. I think that's right. Yes, you're looking at OIE? Yes, that's right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jacob Levenson with Melius Research.
Jacob Levinson: I just wanted to expand on Ryan's question a little bit around AI. And I know you mentioned you've been using machine learning for some time, but maybe you can give us an example or 2 of where there's been a step-change in the capabilities that you have today or expect to have just given the advancements that we've seen coming out of Silicon Valley.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean I can give you -- I'll give you 2, and I mentioned these in the prepared remarks. But a couple of years ago, we developed our own machine learning model to help stock our distribution centers. And this is a messy model with a lot of data because you've got to have supply lead times and slotting physicians and everything in the model, and then you'd let the model work to get the best service out of that. And that has driven significantly improved service in our buildings. And so that model continues to learn, and we continue to use that to basically make sure we have the right products in the right place for our customers. And that's an example of a step forward. I think the other one is we've been using generative AI to work with chatbot with our chat process in our contact centers. And that has helped make our responses to customers better, help them find products faster, and we're going to expand that to other channels as well. So we feel that a lot of opportunities with generative AI with our proprietary data to basically provide better customer experience, and we're going to continue working on those things.
Jacob Levinson: That is super interesting. And actually, just on the DC point, is -- are these new facilities, when you build something from the ground up, I would have to imagine even a facility built 5 years ago is kind of outdated from a technology and automation perspective given all the changes that have happened in AI, just warehouse automation in general. But are these facilities -- how much more productive are they, I guess, is the question relative to the legacy stuff?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. In terms of distribution center productivity, certainly, when we put the building in Manuka, that was the largest good-to-person system in the world, we believe. That is somewhat old technology but still pretty effective. We got probably 4x the picking rates for small parts out of that building. The issue is a lot of the building has forklift drivers and stuff, and that doesn't get us productive. So the overall building is certainly more productive than it was before. But what we've been able to automate and what the industry has been able to automate is mostly small parts picking rather than full pallet picking. And so parts of the building get a lot more productive and parts have not, I'd say. Parts are still sort of driving these around. We actually, though, have also been playing with AI tools that allow our DC team members to be working and get sort of single flow so you can push what to do next to them rather than working on 45-minute slots. And that allows them to, based on where they're at, get the next most efficient thing sent to them. And that, we think, is going to be pretty beneficial for us as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Snyder with Morgan Stanley.
Christopher Snyder: I hopped on a bit late, so I hope this wasn't already addressed. But I wanted to ask about price and gross margin. I think the minimal price expectation for 2025 is maybe a bit below what the market was thinking. So I just wanted to confirm that this is really just a reflection of your expectation for what you think the producers will ask for. And then does the company feel like they can push incremental price if needed?
Donald Macpherson: So we look at a lot of things when we set price. And one is what competitors are doing. One is what our suppliers are asking for. Last year, we were pretty much flat from a GP perspective. We expect to be similar in a high-touch model next year. So yes, our price expectations reflect what our suppliers are asking of us as well, and that's an important element. We think if there is price in the market, we can certainly pass price. And if there's not, then passing price probably isn't the right thing to do. Our price tenet is basically to stay price-competitive and over the long term, be relatively price cost-neutral, and we think we can do those things.
Christopher Snyder: Yes. I appreciate that. And I think you guys were price/cost-neutral in Q4. It seems like the expectation to stay price/cost-neutral in '25. So I guess, is there anything weird with like the typical gross margin seasonality? I know Dee called out some moving parts in Q1 with FX because typically, we get a pretty material step-up on gross margin from Q4 to Q1, which could kind of put Q1 in that 40% range, which makes low 38% for the year, feel like a relatively low bar. But let me know if I'm missing something on that, if there's anything weird on the seasonality.
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. Chris, I'll step in here a little bit. As you and D.G. were discussing, we're really trying to focus our price inflation based upon what we're seeing with our supplier negotiations. And we're not seeing the supplier inflation that then would translate into price inflation like what you're seeing from some of these market indexes. And so then even when we do our straight, we're not seeing that. And one of the things I called out in my prepared remarks is that we do see other product categories that are listed as industrial, and they are in the PPI sub-index. But those are things like airplanes and airplane parts and medical equipment, and we don't sell any of those things. So within that index, there is inflation on those products, but those are not products that we actually sell nor bring into our inventory. So we're not trying to chase that type of inflation.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: So just on the immediate bridging of outgrowth on the volume basis, you had 2%, 2.5% in the second half and then 4%, 4.5% for next -- for the current year. Is that something that kind of builds back gradually given the steeper outgrowth comps in the first half, whereby the first quarter, you're still kind of transitioning to rebuild momentum?
Deidra Merriwether: What I will say is we talked about what we think Q1 will look like, be a slower start to January. So we may have a little softness there. But yes, with us targeting the lower end of the 4% to 5%, that would imply that we would expect some ramping of share gain through the year.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then on the gross margin performance, the 39.6 in the fourth quarter, arguably, the cleanest of the year with lapping some mismatches, and you had some call-outs earlier in the year. So if we were to regard that as something of a jumping-off point, is there a reason that isn't reading through or staying at a bit higher level than how you're benchmarking?
Deidra Merriwether: I think I want to make sure you're talking about Q4 results?
Christopher Glynn: Yes. Was there anything particular in that 39.6 for the company that diminishes into next year?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. Well, we did have about a 40 basis point tailwind this year from the fact that we had an E&O adjustment in the prior year. That's not sustainable. But the things that may be more sustainable is that we did get a slight mix and freight favorability of about 30 basis points in that number. And as we continue to talk about at the total company level, as the EA business grow faster than High-Touch, we will have a headwind from BU mix, and that was about 20 basis points. And so there were some ins and outs there that total to about 50 basis points year-over-year compared to Q4 2023.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Ken Newman: Dee, I was curious if you could just quantify for us how much the fourth quarter ADS was impacted by the timing of holidays and extended customer shutdowns. And then just understanding that there is a lot of noise in 1Q, I'm just really curious if we've seen weekly sales trends in January return to those pre-shutdown levels yet.
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. So if you look at the fourth quarter, we're estimating that -- remember, there was a hurricane and then there was holiday timing. And so there was about 80 basis points impact or benefit from the hurricane for us that happened in October but on the quarter with 80 bps. And then holiday timing of shutdowns was about 50 basis points. And so when you normalize for that, the 4 7 goes to about 4 5.
Ken Newman: Got it. And then maybe color on the January trends?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So the first full week of January, there was a lot of weather events that were challenging to understand. But I would say other than that, things have fought back to what is sort of normal activity.
Ken Newman: Got it. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up here. I know there's a lot of moving pieces here and a lot of investments going into place here in 2025. Is there any way to quantify the dollar SG&A spend for each of those buckets just to help us bridge to what's going to be fixed investment versus what's tied to whatever the volume flex will be in the year?
Deidra Merriwether: Well, generally, we don't share our investment dollar inputs to the business. But I'll say this, we are going to intend to invest incrementally in marketing. D.G. talked about our pay-with-seller ads from a geography perspective. And we're looking to add one, maybe 2, geographies later in the year. And those are our biggest investments that drive demand generation. We'll continue to look at adding products as needed in our merchandising area. That also is accretive. But we've built those teams, so it's not a lot of incremental SG&A. It's more incremental inventory if we find the right products and if we want to bring those products then into stock.
Donald Macpherson: The only other thing I'd add is that on the technology side, we do continue to invest in technology to create advantage long term. It doesn't show up as huge increases in SG&A. But certainly, on a cash basis, it's a big part of our spend.
Operator: And our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan.
Patrick Baumann: A couple of quick ones. Fastenal talks to, I think, a need for like high single-digit top line growth to expand their margins. And then kind of mid-single-digit growth is where they can defend them. Just thinking about your long-term algo, is it similar for Grainger where you need a high single-digit top line to get the high teens incrementals that you need to expand your margins?
Donald Macpherson: No, no. For us -- I mean I'm not sure what Fastenal said. For us, I think it's probably more like mid-single digits we'd see expansion and lower single digits, it would be challenging.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. And then on tariffs, I know they haven't come yet, maybe they won't, who knows. But if you could update us on your global sourcing mix by some of the key regions, maybe China, Mexico, Canada, would be helpful. And then how you'd plan to handle tariffs if they come, will you price to try to hold your gross margin steady? Or will you just put a surcharge in and simply pass the cost on to customers? Curious on any thinking around that.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean in terms of our footprint, we have global sourcing that is probably 60%, 70% in China right now. We are not uniquely exposed. Most of the things that we get from China, everybody gets from China. And we do have sourcing in Mexico. We have sourced -- we've moved some product to Vietnam. We've moved some to India. So we have a broad footprint, for sure. In terms of -- the uncertainty of the tariffs is still pretty strong. But in terms of tariffs, depending on what happens in the marketplace, the competitive environment, we would typically try to pass on and keep the same margins in what we pass on. It just depends on the nature of the tariffs, I'd say, there's still a lot of uncertainty. But we certainly have a good sense for our footprint, and we've been actively moving some of it over the last couple of years.
Operator: And your next question comes from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital Markets.
Chris Dankert: I guess to circle back to that long-term algorithm, maybe on gross margin. Historically, I think the target had been like a 37% gross margin. We're above that range. So it feels like because this mix is stabilizing to being a slight headwind holding the line at 39%, it seems like that's a pretty good performance. So in order to expand EBIT, we've got to really lever on SG&A. How -- would you push back on that characterization? I guess I'm surprised that you think you can expand even on 4%, 5% top line.
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. Yes, I think that's a great question. And yes, if you go back several years ago, you're exactly right. We were saying around this time, we were targeting to be about 37% total company gross margins. We've done better than that. And as we look at our outlook here now and as everyone plans to look in the future, we felt noting that remaining stable around 39%, based upon our value proposition and our 2 go-to-market models, makes the most sense based on polo we're seeing from share gain as well as from competitive pricing. So I think you've got it right. I think we've included details like that on Slide 24 that align with the long-term earnings framework.
Donald Macpherson: And we would also agree that SG&A leverage is going to have to be the primary driver of of any margin expansion going forward, no question.
Chris Dankert: Got it. And I guess just finally, thinking about your market outgrowth formula as well, given your mix, you've got more health care, hospitality, government than kind of just the IP or ISM measurements would have, right? So I think it would make sense for you guys to outperform when industrial is slow. Maybe it's a harder push when you see the acceleration in the ISM. Any thoughts around how we should be interpreting that over time, perhaps?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I mean, obviously, manufacturing is still our biggest segment. So roughly 1/3 of our business is manufacturing. I would say, there's probably over another 1/3 of the business is probably tied to industrial activity. So we are very linked to industrial activity. I do think that the government business is a bit unique and so is the health care business, but those don't make up as much as the total. So I think we're still very tied to IP, and that will always be the case given our structure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Just a question related to the tariffs. And I know your customers would never preposition ahead of a tariff just because it's all MRO and they're not really going to store ahead. But how about Grainger, just in terms of your product positioning, did you, in any way, kind of do some accelerated ordering ahead of what could be a disruptive period, especially from China?
Donald Macpherson: So in general, we evaluate every year whether or not we want to make prebuys at the end of the year. We do a modest amount, and I don't think that really has changed for this year. So we probably did a few things that might have helped us in case this happens. But we don't get in the business of trying to prebuy in a big way, typically. So that's really not part of our motion.
Deane Dray: Good. And I'm correct about the customers absolutely not doing that either?
Donald Macpherson: That's right.
Deane Dray: All right. And then second question, just on the outlook for M&A, just expectations for 2025. Is that a lever that Grainger would be interested in polling? And broadly for the distribution sector, there's been some announcements of some sizable deals. Do you think this is a sea change? You still have a highly, highly fragmented market, and outgrowth organically has still been the primary strategy. But is there anything in the way of M&A that might accelerate that?
Donald Macpherson: I don't -- our strategy doesn't change. We think we're primarily an organic growth company. We do look at any opportunities that come up. There are certain subsets of distribution for which I think M&A probably makes more sense, for sure. And they don't necessarily apply to us. But the short answer is we are always looking, but we expect organic growth to be our primary driver.
Operator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: First of all, thanks for joining. I continue to be very happy with our progress. I think, as we talked about here, our earnings algorithm doesn't change. We continue to focus on providing the best customer experience, on having an engaged team, and I'm making sure we deliver our financial commitments. And we feel very good about our going in position no matter what the market. And as we discussed, if obviously, the market's better than we project, we will do better. That's the way this works. But right now, we think we have all the tools in place to have a really good year. So thanks for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you. And with that, we conclude today's call. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Kyle Bland, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of the comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC. This morning's call, we'll focus on results for the third quarter of 2024, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis. As a reminder, we have included a daily organic constant-currency sales growth metric within these materials to normalize for the divestiture of our E&R Industrial Sales subsidiary, which was sold at the end of 2023. Definitions and a full reconciliation of this and any other non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers discussed will differ from MonotaRO's public statements. Now, I will turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thanks for joining the call. Everything we do at Grainger starts with the Grainger Edge and with a focus on the customer. I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with customers past few months and while the demand environment remains muted, these visits have highlighted the value that we bring every day. Our strong capabilities, including digital, supply-chain and on-site support allow us to help our customers succeed. No matter what each is facing, we are there to help them overcome challenges. Before I get into the financials, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the Grainger team for their continued work in helping those impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast. Fulfilling our purpose, we keep the world working and supporting our customer operations when they need us most. Our branch, KeepStock, distribution center and sales team members have gone above and beyond over the last few weeks, providing vital supplies and relief resources. And as we always have, our team will continue to work side-by-side with our partners to make sure that these communities have what they need to navigate the road to recovery. Moving to the third quarter, while demand remains soft, the business continues to perform well as we remain focused on being the go-to MRO partner for our customers. Both segments grew in the period and we continue to make strategic progress across the company. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we're leveraging our customer and product data assets and strong supply chain capabilities to help us advance our strategic growth engines. We've done great work-in 2024, but I'm particularly pleased with how we're continually utilizing our vast array of proprietary data to improve our customer and team member experience. We've launched new capabilities such as analytical tools that arm our sellers with better insights and data to drive more fruitful conversations with our customers. We're also testing a generative AI model in our call centers, which helps us scale our know-how and equip our customer service agents with fast, relevant responses to help customers get what they need quickly and efficiently. These are just some early examples of how we can leverage our data to help drive share, reduce cost and further improve our service advantage. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead in this space. Driving a great customer experience is also underpinned by our world-class supply chain, one that is built specifically to serve B2B customers and ship next day complete orders. During the quarter, we made progress on enhancing our service capabilities and expanding our distribution center network by officially beginning construction on our New Houston area DC. This along with the continued progress at our new Pacific Northwest distribution center will ensure we maintain our service advantage now and into the future. Within the Endless Assortment segment, our focus on growing share of wallet with enterprise customers at MonotaRO and the changes we've made to better communicate delivery expectations at Zoro have both helped reaccelerate growth over the last couple of quarters. These businesses are on the right track for a strong finish to 2024, setting us up nicely to continue gaining share in 2025 and beyond. Now shifting to third quarter financials. Total company reported sales for the quarter were up 4.3% or 4% on a daily organic constant-currency basis, which normalizes for the E&R divestiture and one more selling day in the current year period. Operating margins for the total company remained healthy at 15.6% and EPS finished the quarter up 4.7% to $9.87. Operating cash flow came in at $611 million in the quarter, which allowed us to return a total of $328 million to Grainger's shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, 2024 is playing out largely as expected as the business continues to perform well and we stay focused on serving customers. With this, we are narrowing our earnings guidance ranges to close out the year, which Dee will outline in a few minutes. As we wrap-up 2024, I'm confident that we will continue to execute well, meet our goals and drive solid results for all stakeholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Dee.
Deidra Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. Turning to Slide 7, you can see the high level third quarter results for the total company, including 4% revenue growth on a daily organic constant-currency basis. This number includes a headwind of roughly 50 basis points from the lap of a heightened level of service engagement in the prior-year quarter. Within the period, we saw relatively stable gross margins across both segments, along with slight deleverage in High-Touch. This led to total company operating margins to be down 30 basis points in the third quarter, largely in line with expectations. Diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.87 was up $0.44 over the prior-year period as higher sales were further aided by a lower share count in the current year. Moving on to segment level results, the High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.3% on a reported basis or 2.5% on a daily organic constant currency basis. Results were driven by solid volume growth and improved price contribution within the segment. We also delivered growth across all geographies in the period in local days, local currencies. In the U.S. specifically, we continue to see flat to positive growth in nearly all customer end segments, including persistent strong performance with contractors, warehousing and healthcare customers. For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.6%, down 10 basis points versus the prior year. In the quarter, we experienced an unfavorable product mix headwind as we lapped a heightened level of service engagements from the third quarter of 2023. This 60 basis point year-over-year headwind was largely offset by several small tailwinds, which included the lap of a one-time adjustment made to clear out unproductive inventory. Price cost for the quarter was roughly neutral. SG&A costs for this segment increased over the period as we continue to invest in demand generation activities, including marketing and seller headcount as well as normal wage inflation. Coupled with the softer topline, this led to SG&A deleverage of 30 basis points. Taking all this together, operating margin for the segment was down 40 basis points versus the prior year, which was largely in line with expectations and remained at a healthy 17.6%. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, using headline industrial production and producer price index, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 2% and 2.5% in the quarter with price once again contributing nearly all of the market growth. With our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business growing at 2.6% organically, our mathematical market outgrowth in the quarter was roughly 50 basis points in total. This includes approximately 200 basis points of volume outgrowth contribution for the quarter, netted with continued price headwinds when comparing our price contribution to PPI. Volume outgrowth year-to-date is roughly 350 basis points, just shy of our 400 to 500 basis point outgrowth target. As we discussed this year, we're currently in a cycle where the growth rate implied by the headline IP and PPI metrics used in our market model is higher than a number of other external data points across the MRO landscape would suggest. This difference continues to cause noise in our share gain calculation. Although we will not mathematically achieve our market outlook target in 2024, when using our headline market model, we remain pleased with returns we're driving across our outgrowth initiatives and are confident we're taking solid share in the current environment. We believe this market measurement dislocation will normalize overtime and we continue to target 400 basis to 500 basis points of outgrowth annually on average. Now, focusing on the Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 8.1% or 11.5% on a daily constant-currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 11.3%, while MonotaRO achieved 15.4% growth in local days, local constant currency. At a business level, Zoro built on its second quarter performance and once again saw strong growth in the mid-teens from its core B2B customers. The headwinds from non-core B2C and B2C-like customers continues to dissipate with sales to those customers roughly flat versus the prior year. The headwinds we've seen from this group are largely behind us and we should go forward on even footing. At MonotaRO, sales growth remained strong with enterprise customers coupled with solid acquisition and repeat purchase rates with small and mid-sized businesses. On a reported basis, these results were partially offset by foreign exchange as the yen continues to be a year-over-year headwind. On profitability, the operating margins for this segment increased 130 basis points to 8.8% with both businesses contributing leverage year-over-year. MonotaRO margins remained strong at 12.4% with DC operating efficiency driving continued year-over-year improvement. At Zoro, operating margins were up 120 basis points to 4.3%, aided by solid operating leverage and a favorable one-time reserve true-up of roughly 70 basis points. These items more than offset an increase in marketing spend. Overall, we're encouraged by the strong progress we've made across the segment and remain on track to finish the year at or above our original expectations. Now moving to the updated outlook for the full year of 2024. As D.G. mentioned at the beginning of the call, while the market has remained muted, results have largely played out as expected for the year. With this, we're narrowing our full year 2024 earnings outlook. The narrow guide includes daily organic constant currency sales growth of between 4.5% and 5.25% and a diluted adjusted EPS range of $38.65 to $39.35. The updated revenue outlook implies a fourth quarter 2024 daily organic constant currency growth rate in the mid-single digits, which includes month-to-date growth in October of approximately 6.5%. This preliminary daily organic constant currency sales growth rate for October includes roughly 200 to 250 basis points of hurricane-related sales, meaning normalized month-to-date results are closer to 4% and 4.5%. Our operating margin expectations haven't shifted much from our prior guide. If you were to squeeze the operating margins from the updated annual guide, it implies a seasonal sequential step down in the fourth quarter to just above 15% at the midpoint. Supplemental guidance has also been updated, including an increase of $150 million to our operating cash flow outlook at the midpoint. As a note, we've lowered our full year 2024 tax rate assumption to approximately 23.2% or 80 basis points less than the prior guide, which implies our fourth quarter tax rate somewhere between 20% and 21%. This reflects anticipated favorability in the fourth quarter as we adjust audit reserves from prior year tax returns and execute various tax planning strategies. Full-year foreign exchange rates have also been updated in the revised outlook. Overall, the year has played out largely as expected and our updated earnings guidance remains within the original ranges we communicated at the beginning of the year. We look forward with confidence in finishing the year strong. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to recognize the Grainger team on earning another notable workplace achievement. Earlier this week, we were named the top ranked company across all industries on the American Opportunity Index, which primarily focuses on the experience of workers in non-college degree roles and the company's ability to offer them growth and development no matter their career path. The index measures the career trajectories of 5 million employees at 400 of America's largest companies via publicly available data. In other words, it's all about the facts, not a submission or a survey, so it's completely objective. This ranking is a testament to our culture, most importantly, our commitment to ensuring every team member can have a meaningful and fulfillment career here at Grainger. We are honored to receive this recognition. With that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.
Ryan Merkel: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start, D.G, with the Endless Assortment growth rate really stood out to me this quarter. It was a nice acceleration from what we saw in the first half. Is there anything you'd point out company-specific or otherwise that really drove that growth a lot higher this quarter?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So what I would say is that MonotaRO continues to have really good success with enterprise customers and has also made some improvements with small businesses as well. So that has been a continuation of some improvement. And then Zoro, we talked about B2C and B2C-like customers being a headwind, that is really no longer a headwind. They were roughly flat with those customers. And so what you're seeing now is mostly the strong business-to-business growth, which was strong last quarter and strong this quarter. So the results are much improved.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay. And then on the fourth quarter, nice start to October. I'm just curious, are you assuming the macro really just stays the same? And then in November and December, should we assume that the hurricane bump of 2%, 2.5% falls off or is that unclear?
Donald Macpherson: I think on both of those, we would say, yes, we would agree with you that macro stays the same and then the hurricane bump falls off in the November-December timeframe.
Ryan Merkel: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. Please state your question.
Jacob Levinson: Hi, good morning, D.G., Dee.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Deidra Merriwether: Good morning.
Jacob Levinson: I think it's been quite some time since we've had, at least for you folks, such a sluggish macro backdrop and you're still spending -- understandably spending quite a bit of money on demand-generating investments. I guess, trying to understand how do you -- how do you kind of balance that investment spend when you're trying to manage growth in this type of environment versus holding a line on margins?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So I think the simple answer, of course, is if something on demand generation is worth spending in good times, it's probably worth spending in bad times, you may adjust the levels depending on sort of the market growth, but we'd still expect to spend in areas that we think are going to create long-term advantage for us and help us grow. I think the most important thing to do is to make sure that in all the core areas of the business, we continue to drive productivity. So we have a lot of core operations. We are very much an operation-intensive business and making sure that we're consistently getting productivity in those parts of the business and we've worked on that in the past and continue to work on that going forward is really critical to make sure that you're able to continue to invest in those demand-generating activities.
Jacob Levinson: Okay. That makes sense. And then just quickly on the balance sheet. You're -- I think you're sitting on the largest cash value you've had since maybe the height of the pandemic area. The balance sheet leverage is pretty low. Obviously, the stock has had a pretty phenomenal run at this point, but can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about your balance sheet options at this point, whether it's buying back stock or even if there are M&A bills out there on your radar?
Deidra Merriwether: So thanks for the question. And if you look at our cash balance over the quarter, we did increase cash meaningfully, because we closed on our new $500 million bond offering, which we'll use to paydown senior notes early in 2025. And if you pull that to the side, it's important to note that the pace of our cash growth really over several years has been in line with our sales growth. And when you look at the excess cash that we do have and look at our capital allocation strategy, we don't envision any changes to that strategy and we will most likely return that cashback to shareholders in the form of share repo. And if you look at our guide -- updated guide for the end of the year, you can see that represented in that number.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sabrina Abrams with Bank of America. Please state your question.
Sabrina Abrams: Hi, good morning.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Deidra Merriwether: Good morning.
Sabrina Abrams: I would -- I just want to ask about the self-help initiatives to gain share in HTS between -- you mentioned the marketing, seller headcount, just looking to understand the traction, anything going particularly well? Anything you're looking to improve on? And just early thoughts on expectations for 2025 in terms of the outgrowth? Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So I'll start and then Dee may add on to this. But basically what we are doing broadly is leveraging our proprietary data and product information and customer information to provide better solutions, whether that's in marketing, where we get more refined and how we market the customers or whether that's in merchandising where we look to make sure that the website is easier for customers to navigate or add products. And then we also are leveraging some of that customer information to improve seller coverage. So we have continued to add sellers this year at a relatively modest rate, but a consistent rate. And all of those are showing very strong returns and continues to show strong returns. Our expectation is that they will continue to show strong returns into next year as well. We won't update our market expectations for 2025 until after fourth quarter earnings. It's probably safe to say that 2025 will start similarly the way 2024 ends. That's usually the way it works. So probably be muted to start the year. But in any case, we are going to continue to invest in leveraging our data assets to provide better customer solutions and better outreach through marketing through coverage, through merchandising.
Deidra Merriwether: And the only thing I'd add, Sabrina, is that we still are targeting from the collective investments in demand generation to outgrow the market by 400 to 500 basis points. And as I noted in our prepared remarks, we are in a period where we do have some dislocation versus our headline IP and PPI metrics. However, when we continue to internally test the return on those investments, those investments are still returning as we would expect. And there still is really a lot of noise. I would say if you look at market surveys, other competitive results or other economic data points related to what volume really is, we believe are actually muted and we are performing fairly well versus the competition.
Sabrina Abrams: Okay, great. Thank you guys. And then just a follow-up. I think you mentioned price cost was neutral in the prepared remarks. Do you feel you need to take incremental pricing actions following the May 1st price increase or do you sort of feel you've taken the appropriate measures for the levels of inflation we are at right now?
Deidra Merriwether: So yes, we did take an additional increase in September. As you know, versus where we expected price to be at the beginning of the year versus where it appears it's landing and based upon 70% of our business in High-Touch being contract-related, we've had to kind of chase to catch-up on some of that. And so our goal would be, as you noted, to exit the year price cost neutral and we are in line with that. Now we're right in the midst of our cost cycle with our suppliers heading into 2025. And as D.G. noted, really not ready to disclose where we think that will head, but we do have a philosophy, of course, as a distributor of passing on cost inflation through price to our customers since we sell on value and we don't expect that to change in 2025.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: Thank you. Good morning.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
David Manthey: My question is, on Slide 9, essentially you're saying the disconnect between your sales and industrial production is just inflation, I guess, or deflation. And so the third quarter '23 share gains might have been overstated while the third quarter of '24 are understated. Is that what you're saying?
Donald Macpherson: No, no. We think that the third quarter of last year was probably stated correctly. What we're seeing right now is the way we calculate share gain is based on IP and based on market price increases as well. And as we look across different other performance indicators, market surveys, competitor results, economic data points, we think we're performing quite well right now. And so we think that the share gain number we're quoting isn't necessarily reflecting all reality. And so in any case, we expect that dislocation to correct itself over the long-term and we'll continue to gain 400 basis to 500 basis points on average annual market growth.
David Manthey: Okay. And then D.G., if I'm trying to square up Slide 19 with Slide 9. 19 as maybe a lens of the U.S. commercial industrial economy that it looks like steady deceleration in most of those categories. And so I'm just trying to understand that relative to you saying the MRO market is kind of steady right now. Is that just Grainger comps that's influencing that or how should we think about 19?
Donald Macpherson: So we would say that the demand trend has been pretty consistent most of this year. You see some fluctuation. Warehousing is up as an example, but certainly things like heavy equipment is down right now. So there are puts and takes. Net-net, it's not a huge change from the beginning of the year to now, but it's been pretty slow growth all year, I would say.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.
Tommy Moll: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Deidra Merriwether: Good morning.
Tommy Moll: So you mentioned that the year is playing out largely as expected. And I was curious if we go one layer deeper just in terms of the pricing versus volume trends. Would you say the same for each of those, or are there may be some offsets where pricing maybe is coming in a little bit better than expected, volumes a little bit weaker, or the reverse of that?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. Market price, as you noted, has been fairly resilient all year. Now for us, as I kind of talked about in a prior question, we started off the year pricing fairly light versus what has actually occurred and have been pulling through price as appropriate while we're still maintaining price competitiveness. From a volume perspective, I think the market is closer to right there. And if you look at those components, it's like flat to down on volume. And as you can kind of see in the U.S., we have actually grown volume positively. I've been around here for about 11 years and when I looked at IP and PPI over time, you'll get to the next year and it does a really good look-back and makes a lot of corrections. When we look at what D.G. kind of talked about, other surveys or other metrics, it feels like those corrections will be to the downside as we look back at 2024 and that's what all of our data as it relates to our AB testing and a lot of our pre- and post-testing on our investments are telling us.
Tommy Moll: And sticking on the market-share theme, are there any anecdotes you could share just on competitive contract wins or things you're seeing in the business that you're winning every day that would also corroborate what you're communicating in terms of the share capture?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Well, I think the easiest one is just to look at sort of revenue growth across all the competitors to get a sense for that. I would say from a customer input I've been with a lot of customers last couple of months and generally, there's no panic we're -- and we are viewed as adding a bunch of value to their business. And I think we're doing all the right things and winning contracts and of course, losing some as always. But generally, the customer interactions feel pretty good right now in terms of how they view some of the value that we're creating.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Patrick Baumann: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first, I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about KeepStock. It feels like it's not something that's come up in a while, not because you haven't had success there, I think. I think it's been growing nicely, but maybe you could provide some perspective on how big it is now in terms of the High-Touch segment, what type of growth you're seeing? And any thoughts on that announcement from Amazon around like the Amazon Business Restock program, like where might they be trying to go after customers in terms of vending, in terms of inventory management? It just seems like they're moving to a higher touch offering than historically. Wondering if you had any thoughts on that at all. I know it's early, so I think that you might not.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, no, so KeepStock continues to grow faster than the business on the whole. A large majority of our revenue volume comes from customers that have some sort of KeepStock installation as well. So you can track it sort of the volume through KeepStock, which would be probably high-teens or something like that. But you can also track it in terms of how many customers, the total revenue half that KeepStock installation and there's a lot of them. What I would say is that doing KeepStock well requires, particularly in the spaces that we operate in, understanding dirty places in manufacturing plants and making sure you locate them right. And there's a lot of work that goes into that, consulting, having the right industrial products and getting them to customers quickly and being able to stock bins and make sure we're at the right locations within a plant. And so we don't know everything about the Amazon announcement, but it's pretty simple to get vending going, which is what they're talking about doing. And I think they're planning to use third-party as they announce to stock. We don't know how that will play out, but we feel pretty confident in our ability to provide a lot of value on the platform.
Patrick Baumann: Thanks for the color. And then maybe one for Dee. On the gross margin outlook for the fourth quarter, I'm squeezing into something that's higher sequentially than the third quarter and would be up nicely year-over-year. Just wondering if I'm doing the math right. And if so, what's driving that and if that's right, like should we expect gross margin expansion in '25? It just seems like a nice exit rate for the year.
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. Maybe I point you to like sequential versus year-over-year. And the price cost, which kind of came up, we were expecting to end the year a positive, mainly due to supplier rebates. That's going to definitely help us. We do have some business unit mix offsets to that and a little bit of freight. But net-net, on a sequential basis going from Q3 2024 to Q4 2024, we do expect to expand gross margins. Since we're not talking about 2025 outlook, like I noted earlier, we're in the midst of our contract negotiations on COGS and of course, watching market pricing. But as D.G. noted, we expect the first quarter or the first half to look a whole lot like we're ending this half and that has been price moderating -- continuing to moderate a bit since we've exited the pandemic. So I don't see it being particularly strong in 2025, but do feel like there will be some price in the market.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: All right. Well, thank you. Thanks for joining our call. Really appreciate it. As we discussed, we think we continue to perform well in a certainly muted demand environment, but we're really confident in the things we're doing and feel good about the way the company is moving. And we're going to continue to execute on the things that really matter. Appreciate the time. Have a safe and fun Halloween if you're into that and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. All parties may disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to W.W. Grainger Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's second quarter earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC. This morning's call will focus on the adjusted results for the second quarter of 2024, which exclude $16 million of pre-tax restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Please remember that we have also included a daily organic constant currency sales growth metric within these materials to normalize for the divestiture of our E&R Industrial sales subsidiary, which was sold at the end of 2023. Definitions and full reconciliations of this and any other non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and followed Japanese GAAP, which differs from US GAAP, and as reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ from MonataRO's public statements. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. As we pass the midpoint of 2024, I'm proud of the way the team continues to show up for our customers, providing a flawless experience on each transaction. Our team members are consistently living the principles outlined by the Grainger Edge and in doing so we become a trusted partner for our customers, creating tangible value each day. One of the best examples of the value that we create for our customers is by simplifying their purchasing processes. Complicated and high-cost purchasing processes are common in our space, wasting our customers' time and money. Fortunately, we are well-equipped to help customers solve this challenge by assisting them in choosing the right digital solution, setting up necessary workflows and approvals and providing systems training to maximize the benefits. Recently, during negotiations on a multiyear agreement, one of our national account managers identified opportunities where our team could help the customer meet their process improvement goals, most notably in streamlining their procurement systems, engage our internal EDI pro team who worked with the customer to connect their purchasing platform to Grainger. Together, through enterprise-wide integration and training, we were able to move nearly all of the customers' MRO transactions to a digital channel, helping them consolidate orders, lower PO processing costs and driving several hundred thousand dollars in annual savings. These process improvements are part of a broader engagement with this customer, we also help them reduce inventory levels and drive product standardization, further saving them time money. This example is just one of many where our team works to understand the customers' operations, tailor our solutions to meet their needs and drive lower cost. Moving on to our second quarter performance. We delivered another solid quarter of results amidst a slow, generally stable demand environment. Total company reported sales were up 3.1% or 5.1% on a daily organic constant currency basis, with positive contributions from both segments. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we remain focused on our growth engines and delivered tangible value for our customers, resulting in another quarter of solid performance. Within the Endless Assortment business, our focus on gaining new customers and increasing repeat purchase rates is paying off, and we continue to make progress with these initiatives. From a profitability standpoint, total company operating margin of 15.4% remained strong, but as anticipated, was down 40 basis points versus prior year. EPS finished the quarter at $9.76, up 5.2% versus the prior year. Beyond the P&L, we achieved ROIC of 42.6% and operating cash flow remained healthy in quarter, allowing us to return a total of $345 million to Grainger's shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, the business continues to perform well, as we stay focused on the customer and the things that matter. While 2024 is playing out largely as expected, further yen devaluation and continued pockets of demand stops in the U.S. remain as headwinds. With this, we've trimmed the top end of our earnings guidance range, which Dee will discuss in a bit. Now I'll turn it over to, Dee.
Deidra Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. Turning to Slide 7. You can see the high-level second quarter results for the total company, including 5.1% growth on a daily organic constant currency basis. The quarter played out largely as anticipated, despite the persistent demand softness D.G. mentioned. Operating margins were down 40 basis points year-over-year, generally following normal seasonal trends. Gross margins were flat year-over-year as the number of items offset within the period and SG&A de-levered 40 basis points as we ramp our demand generation investment. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.76, up 5.2% or $0.48 over the prior year period. Moving on to segment level results, the High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.1% on a reported basis or 3.7% daily organic constant currency basis. Results were driven by strong volume growth and moderate price contribution across all geographies in the period. In the U.S. specifically, nearly all customer end markets were up year-over-year with warehousing, contractors and healthcare customers having the largest gains. For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, flat versus the prior year. In the quarter, we expanded an unfavorable lap of roughly 40 basis points from the nonrecurring rebate benefit captured in Q2 of 2023, which was offset by several small tailwinds in the current year period. When excluding the unfavorable lap of nonrecurring rebate, price cost was roughly neutral in the quarter. SG&A de-levered 40 basis points in Q2 as DC capacity came online, and we continue to invest in demand-generating activities like marketing and seller head count. Annual merit increases that went live in April were offset by productivity actions and lower variable compensation expense within the period. Overall, it was a solid quarter of growth and profitability for the High-Touch Solutions business. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price grew in quarter between 2.5% and 3%, with price contributing nearly all of the growth. Within our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business, growing at 3.6% organically, our mathematical market outgrowth in the quarter was roughly 100 basis points in total. This includes approximately 300 basis points of volume outgrowth contribution, netted against the continued price tailwinds when comparing our price contribution to PPI. As we said before, there is no perfect way to measure the MRO market, and we're currently in a cycle where the headline PPI and IP metrics don't completely reflect what we're seeing in the MRO specific space. With the differences in product and customer mix, these disconnects happen from time to time and cause short-term noise within our external market share gain calculation. Given the current dislocation we're seeing this year, it's unlikely we will mathematically achieve our market outlook target in 2024. However, we have several different ways, including both internal and external data points to understand our relative performance and know we're performing quite well in the current environment. History would suggest that this dislocation will normalize over a multiyear period and we believe this metric remains useful in tracking our relative performance over time. We're still generating strong returns on our demand-generating investments, which gives us confidence that over the long-term, we will continue to outload the market by 400 basis points to 500 basis points annually on average. Now turning to the Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 3.3% or 11.7% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro US was up 8.7%, with MonotaRO achieving 13.2% in local days local currency. At a business level, Zoro saw improved growth from core B2B customers who were up mid-teens in the quarter. Performance was driven by B2B customer acquisition and improved repeat purchase rates, which were aided by service enhancements to increase same-day shipping and better communicate delivery date. Headlines from the continued unwind of non-core business, including B2C, B2C like volumes started to dissipate in the quarter but remained down low-double-digits year-over-year. We expect these B2C headwinds to continue to subside as the year progresses. At MonotaRO, sales were strong from continued growth with enterprise customers, coupled with solid acquisition and repeat purchase rates with small and midsized businesses. On a reported basis, these results were all offset by continued foreign exchange rate pressures as the yen continues to show incremental weakness against the dollar. On profitability, operating margins for the segment declined 70 basis points to 7.9%. This decline was driven by lower gross margins at MonotaRO from product and customer headwinds, combined with SG&A deleverage at Zoro as the business ramps marketing investments and re-baselines on lower B2C and B2C like volume. As these volumes normalize, this should create a better baseline to relever the business going forward. Overall, for Endless Assortment, we're encouraged by the strong progress in the quarter, and are track to finish the year at or above our original expectations. Now moving to the updated outlook for the remainder of 2024. As D.G. mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are we are trimming the top end of most estimates to reflect continued market softness as macroeconomic uncertainties persist in the US. With this, now expecting total company daily organic constant currency sales to grow between 4% and 6% for the full year of 2024. When including the continued deterioration of the Japanese yen, this translates to an updated reported sales range between $17 billion and $17.3 billion and an EPS range between $38 and $39.50. As you can see on this slide, we flow these changes through and have also made slight tweaks to the margin outlook based upon how we're performing in the first half. I want to note, while we continue to remain diligent on managing expenses and measuring returns, given the softer top-line, our ability to generate leverage is challenged this year as we invest in our growth engines to power long-term share gain. Setting that aside, we remain strongly committed to growing SG&A slower than sales over time and have a track record of doing so. Supplemental guidance ranges, including increased operating cash flow and share repurchase expectations can be found in the appendix of this presentation. On seasonality, as we move to the second half of the year, we expect relatively normal sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 and into the fourth quarter. There are some puts and takes from a profitability perspective, but we anticipate operating margins and earnings to remain healthy and relatively consistent in the third quarter when compared to the second. As we start the third quarter, a number of external factors have impacted our results in July. The sales started to ramp in the final few days of the month. This led preliminary July sales results to finish up roughly 2% on the total company daily organic constant currency basis. Of note, this number will be approximately 100 basis points higher if you normalize for the tough comp caused by an elevated level of project-related service engagement in July of last year. Altogether, at the total company level, we're performing well and are confident in our ability to drive solid growth and strong profitability in the second half of the year. With that, I'll pass it back to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. As we head into the second half of 2024, a number of macroeconomic uncertainties remain ahead, but our teams are committed to focusing on what matters most, meeting our customers' needs and creating value for their business. We know that our ability to serve our customers better than our competitors relies on having a strong culture where team members can have a meaningful and fulfilling career. Among several other recognitions this year, Grainger was recently named the best workplace for millennials. These awards are a testament to the well-rounded culture we've built to help us fulfill our purpose. I'm confident that Grainger will continue to be recognized as an employer of choice because of the emphasis we put on living our principles. One of those principles, starting with the customer, it's key to achieving great results for all stakeholders. And I'm confident that we will continue do that in 2024 and for years to come. And with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Please proceed.
Tommy Moll: Good morning and thank you taking my questions.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Tommy Moll: I wanted to start on the High-Touch business, where once again, the midsized customers outgrew the large. And my question is really, how much do you think this is a function of share gain versus some other factor? How important to the midsized customers is the digital capability versus that level of importance for the larger customers? And what do you think the runway is ahead on these favorable trends for the midsize? Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Thanks, Tommy. I think most -- almost all of the growth in midsize customer and the outgrowth would be share gain. The reality is that -- and I think most people know the story. We, at one point, we're close to $2 billion in revenue. We got down to $800 million. We're back up to where we were. We think there's a long runway ahead. We believe that the digital capabilities we've built and the customer and product information assets we built help us with midsized customers significantly. And so really, we think it's what we're doing to build relationships with them through digital capabilities, a lot of those customers when you look at how they buy, start digital and that's their main channel.
Tommy Moll: Shifting gears. D.G., last quarter, you referenced inflation being stickier than expected and talked about some corrective price actions slated for early May. I'm just curious for an update there, how is realization. And do you still think you'll land and price cost neutrality by the end of this year? Thanks.
Donald Macpherson: Yeah. Yeah. We do believe we'll land in price cost neutrality by the end of the year, the price realization the realization of the pricing actions on May 1st have been basically as expected. We talked about at the beginning of the year we were a little bit behind on price increases. We are making some of that up as the year progresses. And notably, gross profit remains strong. So we are not concerned about ending the year as we expect.
Operator: Our next question is from Dave Manthey with Baird. Please proceed.
Dave Manthey: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning everyone. You may have mentioned this, but June average daily sales running up $7 million after sort of $4 million to $5 million all years? Is there anything we can read into that? And again, I apologize if you mentioned it, but did you make any comments on the trends in July so far?
Deidra Merriwether: Yeah. On the reported remarks, we noted that preliminarily, July is rolling up around 2%. However, if you recall, we believe if you normalize for some project-related service revenue outside, project-related service revenue we had last year, that would -- that would put us north of 3% for July.
Dave Manthey: Okay. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: I would just say that, Dave, that I think that June, July, the differences are probably noise. We actually don't think there's -- we look at daily run rates, we are concerned about anything, and there's nothing that I would say that would necessarily cause us other than noise.
Dave Manthey: Yeah, makes sense. Thank you for that. And then, I know other international is small, but we're talking $300 million drag on overall profitability, maybe a distraction, I don't know, could you update us on the other international operations and what you're targeting there medium-term?
Deidra Merriwether: Yeah. The majority of that is Cromwell plus some other charges and other. But the Cromwell business has been working towards profitability. And if you recall, our results last year, they exited the year profitable. And they continue to see profitability this year. Now in this quarter, they had a little bit of a challenge with some gross margin related to customer mix, but we expect them to end this year profitable as well. And we feel like the U.K. is an important market for us. And we just -- with Brexit and some other challenges over the last couple of years has kind of delayed some of our strategic plans in that business. But that we feel that business is doing really well and have outgrown the market the last six quarters.
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed.
Ryan Merkel: Hey everyone. I wanted to go back to pricing. What do you expect for 2024 now? And any more color you can provide on the May and September increases? Was that on specific products or was that across the board?
Donald Macpherson: So I guess what I'd say is we follow two tenants. We want to make sure that we are priced competitively, and we want to make sure that over time, we're shooting for price/cost neutrality. I think we will do that this year. Our price increases this year will be modest overall. Our cost increases will be modest overall on product cost. But we are making adjustments both at May 1 and September 1, and those adjustments aren't meaningful in aggregate, we would expect to be in that 1% range that we talked about roughly at the beginning of the year, 1% to 2%.
Deidra Merriwether: 1% to 2%, yes.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just back to the macro, D.G., any factors you would point out that caused you to lower the second half or maybe just rank the things that drove that? And generally, what are you hearing from customers about the outlook?
Donald Macpherson: Yeah. I think what we're seeing is what everybody is saying, if you look at sort of the general demand environment, it's pretty slow. It's consistent, though, there's not a lot of panic. There are certain industries that have had significant challenges this year, pockets of automotive, pockets of other. I won't get into too many details about those, but certainly, there are -- there are pockets of weakness that have been significant and some pockets of strength. And I think that just continues to be the case. We expect -- I think we came in thinking that volume this year would be flat in our market, roughly something like that, and it's probably going to be down 1 now. So that's probably given what we've seen. That's probably the biggest change we have in our projections.
Operator: Our next question is from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. Please proceed.
Jacob Levinson: Good morning, everyone.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning, Jake.
Jacob Levinson: On the marketing investment, I know you guys have a tight feedback loop there and understanding where to push the accelerator or not. But is that spend something that you would look to actually flex up in sort of a swapper macro environment? Or is it really not demand dependent, if you will?
Donald Macpherson: So the way we measure marketing, we look at -- we run tests all the time. And that guides us on how much to spend. So you could argue that in certain macro environment, those tests might show different results. But in general, that's not going to change how we think about spending. We're spending to levels that give us a margin return that we expect. And none of that's changed and I wouldn't expect that to change through time.
Jacob Levinson: Okay. That makes sense. And then just on the distribution investments that you're making that's been pretty well telegraphed back at your Analyst Day a few years ago. Can you just help us understand where you are in that cycle? And maybe just give us a sense of maybe what the utilization rates look like today in your network.
Donald Macpherson: Yeah. We're -- the network is pretty busy, I'd say. We probably -- I think we talked about this in 2022. We were probably a bit behind. It was difficult to actually build anything during the pandemic to get materials and finished things. We have remedied some of that situation, we've put in three new bulk warehouses, the building in the Northwest, the shell the building is up and we will start receiving by end of this year, and start shipping next year. We have a building in Houston. That is just land now, but that's going to go up as well. So we've talked about those two and announced those two buildings. I would say that the biggest bulge in capital right now, we would project would be probably next year as we finish those two buildings out and then we expect to be in probably more normal times after that and being a little bit better shape from capacity perspective. But yeah the plan has just been executed exactly, as we expected and timing that we haven't changed on any of that.
Operator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jeff Reive: This is Jeff Reive on for Deane. My first question is on the Endless Assortment segment, pretty nice organic growth this quarter. I know one of your peers had some eCommerce stumbles recently. Curious if, you're winning share there or if that may be created an opportunity to do so?
Donald Macpherson: I wouldn't necessarily tag what happens to us to any specific competitor. The market is quite big, that Zoro in the U.S. plays in. I think what's happened with us, is we've gotten much better at getting better repeat rates, and we've been able to get better acquisition also this year. So the two things we focus on have gone better, but I wouldn't tag it to any competitor.
Jeff Reive: Got it. And then, just on guidance, the kind of turning the high end. I think you called out kind of the weaker macro and yen devaluation. If you had to kind of peg it percentage to each of those buckets, kind of how should we think about it?
Deidra Merriwether: Can you repeat that? I'm trying to make sure, I'm following your question around guidance.
Jeff Reive: Yes. Yes. So you trimmed guidance and basically called out, it's a combination of a weaker macro and then also the yen devaluation. I was curious if you could just kind of point to kind of give a percentage to each one into the kind of the reason behind the trimming of the guidance.
Deidra Merriwether: Okay. Yeah.
Jeff Reive: Is it more macro, is it more yen? Yeah.
Deidra Merriwether: Okay, so more macro, so probably two-thirds macro and probably a third yen.
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Yeah, just Slide 19, you show the verticals for HTs and really pretty remarkable balance across there with just a couple of flat, everything else up was curious about the double-digit categories, warehousing and other and then contract are up high-single digits. I think there is a bit of a grab bag, but those numbers for those sectors seem a little incongruous with general macro, so curious, if you could opine there.
Donald Macpherson: Yeah. I mean, so for contractors, in particular, I'd also make a point that we're pretty small. So we start with a pretty small base. So I'm not sure that you can compare that to what's going on in the broader market. Warehousing, there's some comparisons to last year with some customers that are positive right now that's driving that. I wouldn't read too much into those just to be fair. I think that we're performing fairly consistently across the segments and then you have sort of in-year impacts that are a little unusual into the [indiscernible].
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then, second question is on Zoro. Could we get an update on the path to margins? Clearly, demand Gen is going very well there back to mid-teens for the B2B, but kind of low single-digit margins. How should we maybe just want to revisit the path there to get to target margins?
Donald Macpherson: Yeah. What I would say is that, probably low point, it was probably fourth quarter was last end of last year. We think from now on, we're going to get better consistently, and we'll be able to get SG&A leverage as we move forward given the growth rates we're seeing. So, it will start to get better through the back half of this year and we think into next year as well. And so we're pretty confident that we'll start the rise. It's not going to be fast. It's going to be very consistent in terms of getting improved margins into the business.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Patrick Baumann: Good morning. Quick one maybe for Dee. Can you talk about the external factors that you mentioned impacting the July growth rate. And you mentioned a ramp back toward the end of the month and something about sequential growth from second quarter to the third quarter, but my line cut out. So just wondering if you could rehash what you were saying on that.
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. Well, if you look at just July, you're talking about July now and not the prior quarter, right? When we started this month, the month started a little sell. There were a number of things that happened. There was some weather-related impacts that didn't go in our favor. There was also a well-known IT outage that impacted a number of our customers as we cover a lot of people in the US. And then there was just some general holiday softness. This is really unique because a lot of it happened around the same time. So really, really hard to measure. I'll say the good news is the last week of the month has been -- was really strong for us. And so that is a good sign. So those were some of the impacts that we noted on a go-forward basis. I think you're asking the next question sequentially. Sequential sales, am I correct from like this quarter to the next. If you look at that from a top line perspective, we expect that to be reasonably consistent Q2 to Q3 and through the fourth quarter. And then as it relates to some of our other metrics from a sequential perspective, we're expecting profitability sequential growth from the revenue number that I just talked about. We expect profitability there's going to be some puts and takes there, but we anticipate operating margins and EPS to also remain relatively consistent through the balance of the year.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. And then I may have missed, but did you talk about the restructuring you did in the quarter? Was it just kind of what was it? And what is the expected benefit from it? Is there more to come in terms of the restructuring? Or was it kind of isolated just to the second quarter?
Deidra Merriwether: Sure. As we've talked about making sure that we could continue to invest in cycle to ensure that we have long-term share gain. A part of that is making sure that we're paying for some of those investments through productivity actions. And so our entire business really focused on continuous improvement and looking at how we can drive productivity. So a lot of those actions were focused on voluntary actions with team members and that happened both in the US and internationally quite a bit. We see that as a onetime specific incident. However, our focus on continuous improvement is longer term. And we -- in doing those things, we are gaining scale on our non-demand generating expenses, and we expect that to continue through the cycle as we continue to invest in demand generation.
Operator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to D.G. for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: All right. Thanks for joining us. It must be a busy day because we didn't get them as many questions as normal. But I appreciate you joining. And I would just reiterate that we are -- we feel really good about where we're at. We're going to continue to invest in the core capabilities that we need to build to make sure that we can serve customers better than our competitors. That's really what we're focused on. And we're also focused, as Dee said, on driving productivity through the business. We think doing both of those things at the same time is absolutely critical for our long-term success. So, I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer, and thanks. Thanks for joining our call.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.
 I will now turn the conference over to Kyle Bland, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's first quarter earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO.
 As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC.
 This morning's call will focus on results for the first quarter of 2024, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis. As a reminder, we have included a daily organic constant currency sales growth metric within these materials to normalize for the divestiture of our E&R Industrial Sales subsidiary, which was sold at the end of 2023.
 Definitions and full reconciliations of this and any other non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and followed Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ from MonotaRO's public statements.
 With that, I'll turn it over to D.G. 
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thanks for joining the call. 2024 started well. As we remain grounded in the Grainger Edge, we are focused on starting with the customer and staying focused on what matters most. I've seen this play out in several ways throughout the quarter.
 In February, we hosted the Grainger Show in Orlando. Over 10,000 of our customers, suppliers and team members came together to showcase the products and solutions that Grainger offers. It remains a great opportunity to work together with our partners to solve customer problems. We've received great feedback on progress since the event.
 I've also had the opportunity to meet with a diverse set of customers from many industries. It has been great to see how the Grainger team continues to deliver value and further embed into our customers' operations. During a recent visit to a musical instrument manufacturer, I had the chance to see how our team partnered with the customer to help them standardize their product portfolio to lower cost and improve efficiency. This included leveraging our strong supplier relationships and expanding our KeepStock solution to ensure they have the right products in the right locations.
 I also spent time with a large public health system, which is in the process of building a new hospital. Throughout the project, we supported their operations as they transition to the new facility, ensuring products remain readily accessible across the campus. By supporting this customer throughout the significant change, we deepened their trust in Grainger and allowed them to focus on their area of expertise, patient care, while we took care of their MRO needs.
 Across all my visits, it's clear that we continue to show up well for our customers. Based on what I've seen, while each industry dynamic is different, overall demand for MRO products has remained soft but generally steady to start the year. Inflation remains a talking point with customers and suppliers and is turning out to be stickier than we had originally anticipated heading into 2024. Dee will provide details in a bit.
 Moving on to our first quarter performance. You can see we started the year largely as expected, delivering another year solid -- another quarter of solid results. Total company sales were up 3.5% or 4.9% on a daily organic constant currency basis with positive contributions from both segments. In High-Touch Solutions, we continue to advance our 5 key growth engines as we leverage our technology and data assets to unlock further value for customers.
 Within the Endless Assortment business, we remain focused on acquiring new customers and improving repeat purchase rates across the segment, and we made solid progress here in the quarter.
 From a profitability standpoint, total company operating margin was down as anticipated to 15.8%, a decrease of 80 basis points over the prior year. EPS finished the quarter roughly flat versus prior year at $9.62.
 Beyond the P&L, ROIC remained strong at 42.9%, and operating cash flow finished at record levels, which allowed us to return a total of $360 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
 Lastly, I want to mention that yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 53rd consecutive year of expected dividend increases, something we are very proud of. In addition, the Board refreshed our repurchase authorization, enabling the buyback of up to 5 million shares of common stock. These combined actions reflect our continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a balanced and return-focused approach.
 Overall, 2024 started off largely as expected, and the business continues to perform well. With this, we are reiterating our full year 2024 guidance. We are set up to have a strong year results for all stakeholders.
 I'll now pass it to Dee to go through the details. 
Deidra Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. On Slide 7, you can see the high-level results for the total company, including 4.9% growth on the daily organic constant currency basis.
 The quarter played out as anticipated despite tough comps, continued rebaselining of the Endless Assortment business and impact from holiday timing in the period. Operating margins were down 80 basis points year-over-year, finished largely as expected in the quarter. Gross margins were lower by 50 basis points as we lapped outsized favorability in the prior year period, and SG&A delevered 30 basis points as we ramp demand-generating investments to drive long-term, profitable share gain. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.62, up $0.01 over the prior year period and in line with our expectations to start the year.
 Moving on to segment-level results. The High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% on a daily organic constant currency basis. Volume growth remained strong, which offset a slight contraction in price due to timing. All geographies saw growth in the period.
 In the first quarter, the U.S. continued to see strong growth with contractors, government and health care customers. This growth offsets slowing demand in other end markets, including manufacturing and commercial services as well as the impact from holiday timing. Overall, demand remained soft but largely unchanged over the last few quarters.
 For the segment, gross profit finished the quarter at 41.8%, improving sequentially but below normal seasonality amidst a more muted pricing backdrop. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was down 60 basis points primarily due to the timing of price/cost spread along with the lap of a 20 basis point onetime favorable freight adjustment in the prior year. These headwinds were partially offset by continued freight and supply chain efficiencies, which began in the first quarter of 2023 and are now fully normalized.
 While the quarter finished in line with our expectations on the gross margin in total, we were a little more price/cost negative than anticipated as the timing of price and cost is never perfect. As the year progresses, we expect price/cost spread will recover and finish the year closer to neutral.
 SG&A delevered 40 basis points as we continue to invest in our demand-generating growth engines, including marketing and store head count. We will continue to stay disciplined with our spending and rigorous and understanding cause and effect, but feel it's prudent to invest through the cycle to gain share over the long term. Overall, these results position us well for another strong year within the high-touch segment.
 Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9. We estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price, grew in the quarter between 2% and 3%, nearly all from continued price inflation. This indicates that the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business achieved roughly 150 basis points of market outgrowth in the first quarter in total.
 Similar to last quarter, this more muted quarterly outgrowth reflects the higher PPI-based price inflation in Grainger's [ first ] quarter price contribution. As we mentioned in the past, there is no perfect market for our business, and we're comparing a broader external metric of inflation to our MRO product mix. There can be noise, especially in quarterly periods.
 That being said, as D.G. alluded earlier, inflation has been stickier than we originally anticipated, and we're taking some corrective actions in the second quarter to ensure we adhere to our 2 core pricing tenets: maintaining market [ driven ] prices while ensuring price/cost neutrality over time.
 Importantly, on a pure volume basis, we're looking at our volume contributions versus the growth in industrial production. Our volume outgrowth is closer to 450 basis points, reflecting continued strong performance for our high-touch growth engine.
 Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 3.7% or 10% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 5.1%, while MonotaRo achieved 13.1% growth in local days, local currency.
 At a business level, Zoro saw continued strong growth from B2B customers who remained up year-over-year in the high single digits. This helped offset continued declines with noncore B2C and B2C-light customers, which were down double digits year-over-year. We expect these B2C headwinds to subside as the year progresses.
 At MonotaRO, sales were strong from continued growth with enterprise customers, coupled with solid repeat purchase rates within their core B2B customer base. On a reported basis, however, these strong results are nearly all offset by continued foreign exchange rate pressures as the yen sinks to near all-time lows versus the dollar.
 Operating margins for the segment declined 20 basis points to 7.9% largely driven by gross margin favorability at MonotaRO from freight and supply chain efficiencies, which were more than offset by negative mix at Zoro as gross margins continue to normalize following the last few years of inflation. Overall, it was a good quarter for the Endless Assortment business.
 Now an update on the remainder of the year. Overall, we said Q1 played out much as we expected, and results aligned well within the guidance ranges we laid out at the beginning of the year. This has continued into April with daily organic constant currency sales up 5.7% month-to-date. This gives us confidence to reiterate our current year -- our current full year 2024 guidance, which includes daily organic constant currency sales growth between 4% and 7% and EPS ranging between $38 and $40.50, up roughly 7% at the midpoint.
 On seasonality, top line comps get easier as we move through the year. Operating margin will dip down sequentially in the second quarter as gross margin moderated slightly, and SG&A leverage declines as merit increases go into effect and marketing investments continue to ramp. With that, we expect modest year-over-year EPS growth in the second quarter with earnings ramping from there in Q3 and Q4.
 Although we are maintaining our guidance ranges, I do want to call out the increasing headwind we're seeing from foreign exchange rates. As it stands today, the dollar to yen spot rate sits roughly at 1.55, well above the 1.44 we originally planned in January and still assumed in our current guidance. If rates remain at these elevated levels, this would cause roughly $140 million incremental headwind to our full year 2024 reported net sales guidance at an approximate $0.13 decrease to annual EPS.
 Overall, we're pleased with how the business is performing and remain confident in holding expectations for the year.
 With that, I'll pass it back to D.G. 
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. Grainger's ongoing success is made possible by our people. And I'm fortunate that I'm routinely able to spend time with our frontline team members. And it's clear that they are deeply connected to our customers, working side by side to help solve their most challenging problems. I believe this commitment to our customers is because of the emphasis we put on building a culture where every team member knows that they can make a difference.
 Earlier this month, Grainger was named to Fortune's Best Place -- Workplaces in 2024 for the third consecutive year. This is an exclusive recognition that honors companies with the best cultures and people, which is a perfect way to describe what we have at Grainger. I'm confident the team will continue to keep working towards our goals and delivering on the things that matter most for our customers, team members and all stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.
 With that, we will open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Manthey with Baird. 
Quinn Fredrickson: This is Quinn Fredrickson on for Dave. First, can you update us on -- you made some comments about taking some pricing actions. I think before you were saying 0% to 1% price in High-Touch this year. Can you update us on that? And then just any gross margin implications from here? 
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So I'll provide a few comments, and then Dee can provide any details. So as you mentioned, inflation has been a bit stickier than we expected. Originally, we thought inflation would be 0% to 1%. It's likely to be 1% to 2% at this point. That outlook is lower than the headline PPI index because our industry-specific factors are different than the PPI index, and that difference has contributed to lower market outgrowth the last few quarters. And we do see these short-term disconnects from time to time. We saw it in 2022 as well. But they smooth out over time.
 We are a little late to judge the increase in prices this year. And so we are taking action 5/1. We price a 5/1 cycle, and that cycle is going to correct -- make some corrections. I think that's well in motion, and that's already basically executed and will start happening next week.
 I think, importantly, when you strip out the lumpiness from pricing, our volume outgrowth has been very good, something like 400-plus basis points. So we continue to see nice volume growth. And we think the pricing will correct. It's just a timing thing. 
Quinn Fredrickson: That's helpful, D.G. Maybe on the Endless Assortment segment. Any color you can share just on that, the B2C portion? I guess, are you seeing that kind of progressed as you would expect and still anticipating that inflecting positively in the back half of the year? And then, obviously, you reported that 10% segment growth even in spite of that. So any change to the 7% to 10% constant currency growth assumption for the year? 
Donald Macpherson: No, we don't have any change. I think we will still have a bit of a headwind for consumers, B2C and B2C-light customers through the second quarter. We think that will go away as the year moves on, and that could become a positive. But generally, that's all built into the 7% to 10%. 
Operator: Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. 
Nigel Coe: So obviously, the yen is fairly small in the scheme of things, to be honest with you, but I'm curious how that impacts potentially MonotaRO's margins. Because I understand a fair amount of the product is imported into Japan from China and places so. Does that have any impact from a transactional basis as opposed to just translational? What is that $0.13, Dee? Does that cover both transactional and translational? 
Deidra Merriwether: So yes, I'll start with the first part of your question. So the majority of MonotaRO's COGS are in the end. They do have some U.S.-denominated, but it's a much smaller portion of their COGS. And they've done a really nice job over the last several years of being able to pass on inflation through price to account for the disaggregation between the yen and the dollar.
 As it relates to -- I think you kind of talked about when we then consolidate the business, you have the tax effect that impacts us. And then we just end up really with [ one ] to eliminate noncontrolling interest, just have the translation risk. And we generally, from a philosophical perspective, don't attempt to hedge translation risk because it's not real economic risk for us. 
Nigel Coe: Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just to tie boon in the second quarter kind of color, I guess. It seems like sales growth might be a little bit better year-over-year. Perhaps, margins a bit more contraction year-over-year than 1Q. How does price/cost look in 2Q versus 1Q in light of the pricing actions? And maybe just talk about how that price/cost develops from 1Q to 2Q. I know there's a lot there, but any more color on 2Q would be helpful. 
Deidra Merriwether: Sure. Yes. I think the first 2 statements you made were correct. And as we look at the balance of the year, starting in the second quarter with the actions that D.G. noted that we are in the process of taking, we expect price/cost to continue to improve from here. And we expect to end the year close to price/cost-neutral. So that team is working really hard, making sure they're following our 2 core tenets, which is, first and foremost, remaining price-competitive, but then also looking through our assortment and estimating the continued cost increases that we're going to experience that we can time that as close to possible as we can so that we can end up price/cost-neutral. 
Nigel Coe: D.G., I wanted to start on the core B2B Zoro customers where I think you said from a customer perspective, you're up high singles this quarter. What can you tell us about some of the initiatives internally? We've redoubled efforts to continue to drive that stickiness and repeat transaction rate among that cohort. And how are those initiatives progressing? 
Donald Macpherson: Yes. They're progressing well. Most of the focus is on -- so Zoro has always been a very good acquirer of new businesses, and they continue to do that well. We look at the Japanese business and Zoro when we compare notes, and the repeat business has been lower historically at Zoro than it's been at Japan. But we steadily increased that. And that is a lot of sort of marketing science, looking at what to present to customers after the first order, how to understand who those customers are, presenting the right products and the right offers after we get that first order. 
 So most of it is around marketing actions that we're taking. And the Japanese team and the U.S. team are working very closely to make sure we transfer best practices and drive repeat rates up. And we see good results for the last -- probably the last 6 months actually in terms of improved repeat rates. 
Nigel Coe: And then a follow-up on inflation, which you've hit on a couple of times here. And it sounds like you're going to address some of the price/cost issues in early May. What are the factors that changed year-to-date? Was it more on the cost input side coming in little hotter than you expected? Or what did you see out there? 
Deidra Merriwether: So I would say it was a couple of things. So one, D.G. talked a little bit about like misjudging the path of inflation here. We started to lower some prices at the end of last year. And so probably did that a little too quickly. And then when we started and assessed the 2024 increases in Q1, probably a little softer there.
 We have a range of outcomes that we attempt to plan for, as everyone else. And we're looking at market outlooks that are continually changing. It's something that we have to deal with every year and we work really hard to get close to -- as close as possible as we can to something that we could definitely execute and hit. And so we also have a range of COGS outcome or cost outcome from our suppliers. And so I'd say the second thing is some of those cost outcomes from the range that we said is coming in a little bit higher than what we had anticipated. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. 
Jacob Levinson: Just on the investment that you folks are making, I assume to see the Grainger ads everywhere these days. But can you give us a sense of where you're spending the money? And is that -- is there any change in the rate of change, if you will, on those investments? Or is this just something you've been doing pretty consistently? And -- or is it -- or is there some sort of opportunity where you see a chance to put a little bit more money to work? And I'll leave it at that. 
Donald Macpherson: I would say that it's all planned. There hasn't been any change in the path. And we invest in many ways, I'd say. But from a cash perspective, supply chain investments, we've talked about the new building in the Northwest and Houston. Those are in full swing. We also invest in technology. That's the other primary investment we make from a cash perspective. And then from an expense perspective, marketing is a big part of it.
 We invest up and down the marketing stack. We invest in advertising. We invest in paid search, of course. And then we invest in what we call mid-funnel, which is more targeted direct marketing with our customers. And what I would say is that we're constantly evaluating the returns on those and making minor tweaks, but what you're seeing today is just normal planned spend. 
Jacob Levinson: Okay. That makes sense. Just on a different topic. And you folks have been a pretty consistent repurchaser of your own stock for a very long period of time. But the shares have obviously had a phenomenal run in the last couple of years -- does that. And you've got a potentially underlevered balance sheet. Has that changed the capital at all and how you're thinking about sort of the external capital allocation priorities here? 
Deidra Merriwether: So we expect to maintain the course on our capital allocation strategy. We feel it's been working well for the investment community. It helps us maintain good level of financial flexibility. But we're targeting to return any excess cash after we have invested to drive long-term growth back to shareholders in the form of the dividend and share repurchase. Those 2 vehicles, we feel, are both efficient for us and efficient for shareholders. 
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. 
Christopher Glynn: Was wondering about the utility and commercial services verticals down mid-single digit. If you could provide any complexion there, particularly maybe in the utility side. It seems like that should be a little stronger. 
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So what I would say is that they're both relatively small for us. And so in utilities in particular, there's a single customer that has had some challenges, and that has had a big impact there. So it isn't really a sector. We don't play big enough in utilities to really be a sector barometer. So I would say it's sort of noise there. 
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Great. And then wanted to ask about the medium customers parallel to, I think it was Jake's question on the small. But you're also developing some regional and vertical models there to support long-term penetration and accelerate the performance there relative to the large customers just given the share differentials and lower penetration with medium. So curious for kind of a diagnostic update on your action plans there with the medium and how you see that unfolding. 
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean a lot of the things that we're doing around the business, certainly, we have a supply chain that's built very effectively for both large and midsized customers. We have a lot of our resources attached to large customers, all of our sales force, our inventory management teams and some of our support teams. And that is the lion's share of our revenue.
 Since we made the price change in 2017, we've recaptured virtually all of what we had lost in midsize customers. And certainly, the marketing initiatives have been helpful for that. The merchandising initiatives have been helpful for that in terms of helping us regain that share.
 We continue to grow faster with midsize customers than large, and we expect to do so for a long time. And there's a number of initiatives that we have that are supporting that. Although I would say most of our initiatives raise all boats, I mean, we do a lot of things that sort of scale across the entire business. 
Operator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray: I joined a little bit late, so I apologize if you had gotten any of the specifics. But I know you called out the timing of the holiday. Just for Easter holiday, can you size that? And was there any impact on January weather that you could detect? 
Deidra Merriwether: Deane, so yes, let me start with the last one, which is January weather. So I would say the impact of January weather for us, we started off a little slower than normal, and then it impacted the quarter a little bit. But by the time we got to the end of the quarter and started to ramp up, it's really immaterial for the overall quarter.
 And then moving to the -- I think you're referencing like the Good Friday holiday. It was about $10 million impact for us in March. And we laid out where we're at month-to-date, up [ 5.7 ]. So we feel like we're in pretty good stead starting off for the second quarter. 
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. And then just second question, any change in the outgrowth dynamics, either what you saw this quarter and expectations for the year? 
Donald Macpherson: No, I don't think there's any change in outgrowth expectations. We talked earlier, if you weren't on, about the fact that price in our market has been a little lower than PPI. Sometimes the broad metrics may not track exactly to our market, but that evens out over time. But our volume growth has been very strong through the quarter, and we're taking action to improve the pricing environment starting May 1. So I think really there's -- we don't think there's really any change dynamic. 
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital Markets. 
Christopher Dankert: Apologies if I missed it, but on the step-up in SG&A in the first quarter here, was there anything onetime there? Maybe just if you could walk through some of the moving parts for the kind of drove that step-up. 
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. No onetime items to call out in nature. I think as we provide color and provide the guide, we've been pretty consistent in noting that as we move through the year, we expect to continue to invest in demand-generating growth engines. And so a lot of the step-up in the quarter was investing in the areas that D.G. kind of called out a couple of questions ago, sorry if you missed that, like marketing and our investments and capacity, those -- that kind of fall into the expense line versus the marketing line.
 I will say that we are very diligent in our spending if it is what we classify as noncore, which is things that are not demand-generating. And those costs were fairly flat in the quarter. And we intend to -- we help those teams invest why they grow, they have to continue to focus on growing much lower than sales. 
Christopher Dankert: Understood. And then just any kind of update on the development and deployment of that customer information tool and kind of how that's been impacting things? 
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean -- so we've been on a several year journey to improve our customer information. What I would say is customer information in our market is really messy. So there isn't clean data sources that tell you who customers are and what they do and how many team members they have and that type of thing. So we've been building our own.
 What I would say is it's been super helpful with some of the seller coverage changes we've made. We're now building in some of our marketing processes. So it has a lot of tentacles in the business, and we're excited about the ability for the tool has been built to be leveraged to improve our ability to serve customers. 
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. 
Patrick Baumann: Dee, maybe a quick follow-up on April. The [ 5.7 ], just wanted to make sure I understood, that excludes divestitures and FX, right? And then was -- so you said $10 million impact from holiday timing in March. I guess that's like 1% of sales maybe, I don't know. Was there something like that also benefiting April in terms of timing? 
Deidra Merriwether: Well, you would expect it to flow into April to the extent that we could pick that up, yes. And the answer is yes to your first question because I think you noted it excludes FX. 
Patrick Baumann: Okay. Yes, so that's organic. Yes. Okay. Sorry, I missed that comment. 
Deidra Merriwether: Organic. 
Patrick Baumann: Okay. Great. And then on the follow-up is on SG&A again. So if we get later in the year and the top line isn't picking up from where we started the year, what's like the ability or desire to kind of toggle that SG&A growth back? I know you mentioned that you're diligent on spending if it's noncore. But what's your willingness to toggle back on some of the investment spending if growth doesn't pick up as the guidance expects? 
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Thanks. What I would say is that we are very focused on productivity improvements throughout the business. I think we are seeing productivity improve. The last few years have been a bit odd, to say the least, in terms of some of the challenges that everybody has had to deal with. And we have really sort of refocused our attention on getting better, getting more productive in every part of the operation. We're going to continue to do that.
 In terms of demand generation spending, I think you're asking specifically if it's worth spending in good times, it's probably worth spending in bad times, too. So we wouldn't typically pull back those things. We think that we exist for the long term and we're trying to win over the cycle, not just in the down cycle. So we would expect to not have dramatic changes in what we spend, but we do expect to continue to drive productivity. 
Operator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to D.G. for closing remarks. 
Donald Macpherson: All right. Thanks for joining, everybody. Really appreciate it. I would just highlight that in general, I would say everything in the quarter was as we expected, and we feel very confident in the path we're on. There's not a lot of new news in this quarter, but we do feel good about the path. We do feel good about our ability to gain share, to become more productive and to make sure we remain price/cost-neutral over the long term. So all things point to really good results for the year.
 So appreciate the time. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude our conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the W.W. Grainger Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and D. Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and periodic reports filed with the SEC. This morning's call will focus on our adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, which excludes the loss on the divestiture of our E&R Industrial sales subsidiary. We have also included a daily organic constant currency growth metric to normalize for the impact on revenue. Definitions and full reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website.  We will also share results related to MonotaRo. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and followed Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP, and as reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ from Monotaro's public statements.  Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thanks for joining the call. In 2023, the Grainger team continued to drive our strategy forward. by remaining focused on what matters most, providing our customers with a great experience and exceptional service. The customers we serve play a vital role in keeping their businesses and institutions running and everything we do is focused on making their jobs easier. We made meaningful progress this year in building new capabilities in both segments to help our customers and team members support the work they do. We've done this by investing in technology, our supply chain network and our High-Touch growth engines to ensure we can provide the best experience as possible.  As a result of this focus, we delivered record sales and earnings for the year. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made and want to take a few minutes to highlight some of this progress in more detail. The Grainger High-Touch solutions model has undergone a digital transformation over the past several years with strategic investments in our infrastructure, talent and the development of custom capabilities to support our customers. We have built key technology infrastructure capabilities focused on 2 main domains that affect customer experience: one, knowing our products better than anyone else and 2 knowing our customers better than anyone else. These endeavors include the development of homegrown software assets around product information management, or PIM and Customer Information Management or CIM, which allow us to store, codify and scale our data assets.  These investments may seem simple and obvious, but in the MRO industry context, product and customer integration is very challenging. We offer millions of products with many technical attributes unique to each product category and then deliver these products to millions of customers across a wide range of industries. We have made great progress here, but the exciting part is that we still have a long way to go. We have invested in additional technology talent that can partner with our MRO subject matter experts to bring Grainger's industry know-how to life. This partnership of talent is yielding significant benefits and helping us generate high-quality proprietary data insights through PIM and CIM. These insights are fueling our growth engines and helping us drive share. For example, our ability to capture detailed product attributes allows us to bid on more relevant keywords that could ultimately yield higher returns on our marketing spend.  In addition, having this detailed product information, coupled with customized workflows and processes, means we're able to work with more granularity to gain confidence that our products are competitively priced, and we can do that at scale. Honestly, what we know about our customers' business operations through CIM, alongside our detailed product data, allows us to better match products to customers saving in time and increasing confidence in their purchase. These are just a few examples where we have leveraged our data investments in an ecosystem where talent and technology work together to drive great outcomes. This work is serving as a great foundation for the value we deliver through our high-touch strategic growth engines.  Starting with merchandising, we've reviewed roughly 80% of the overall product portfolio at least once, and plan to finish collectively reviewing the entire assortment by the time we close out 2024. We continue to see strong revenue lift equating to several hundred basis points per remerchandise category. Our second and third passes through the assortment have a broader lens in the first pass as we continue to leverage learnings, evolve our PIM capabilities, as we add other relevant areas to our review process. We are seeing strong results from this Evergreen initiative, which we believe sets us up well to continue to drive share gain through this work stream in the future.  Shifting to marketing. We continue to make progress through this initiative. This year, we've put a particular emphasis on leveraging CIM and expanding top of funnel marketing efforts to TV and streaming channels to increase brand awareness. We have seen positive results in many areas and plan to continue to increase investment at attractive returns going forward. Our sales force remains an important demand generator for Grainger. As mentioned at Investor Day, [indiscernible] the use of our enhanced CIM data to redraw seller territories to better serve underpenetrated customer locations.  With this, for the first time in several years, we've added about 200 salespeople to the organization over the last 1.5 years. It takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months for these new team members to ramp to a profitable level. But with the results we've seen so far, we are on the right path and expect this initiative to contribute to outgrowth over the next few years. To ensure that our sales force is most effective, we're investing in tools and technology, which leverage information from PIM and CIM to provide insights to our sellers at scale to help them better plan the day-to-day interactions with customers. We are piloting several different capabilities here in 2024.  Lastly, with our enhanced customer information, we are finding additional opportunities to embed our solutions and reinforce the value we bring to customers. This includes bolstering our value-added services offering and advancing our inventory management capabilities to improve keep stock processes and technology, both of which increase stickiness with customers, improve our productivity and drive share. This has been a multiyear journey, which is creating a significant competitive advantage for our business. As we layer on further enhancements and leverage machine learning and AI capabilities, we will continue to power our growth engines, drive share and deliver customer value.  Moving to the end assortment model, despite more muted top line growth in 2023, the proven flywheel continues to fell forward. MonotaRO continues to execute well. They've seen strong growth with enterprise customers continue to expand with small and midsized customers and are gaining operating leverage as they ramp into their distribution center in Gala. In January, I had the opportunity to visit MonotaRo and was able to see the progress within the Gala, which has been supported by a tight partnership between our U.S. supply chain organization and our Japanese counterparts. The team has progressed on their strategy, expanding their assortment, attracting new customers and improving B2B customer retention.  While repeat rates improved in 2023, the team continues to focus on this evergreen initiative. This includes presenting and personalizing our most advantaged assortment, assessing our price competitiveness and proactively communicating delivery times to highlight where we are advantaged. For many of these efforts, the team continues to work with their MonotaRO peers to share best practices that work together to move the business forward.  Now let's turn to Grainger's advantaged supply chain. We've made great progress to return service back to near normal levels following the unprecedented global supply chain disruption that our industry experienced over the last few years. We continue to hear that Grainger's product availability and our next-day order complete shipping capabilities greatly set us apart from our competitors, allowing us to show up well and win with customers. As I mentioned at our 2022 Investor Day, we set out to accelerate our investment in capacity, automation and sustainability initiatives to further strengthen our service advantage.  We are well on that path as we add new square footage to the network, including the following: Three new bulk warehouses, including a 525,000 square foot facility in Pineville, North Carolina, that's scheduled to open later this year. A 535,000 square foot distribution center currently under construction in Gresham, Oregon which is on track to open in 2025. and as shared earlier this week a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center near Houston, Texas. With the addition of these facilities, we're adding 3.5 million square feet to our supply chain network in total, representing more than a 35% increase from where we began 2023. These latest investments will only strengthen our promise to customers who count on us to provide next-day complete orders to keep their operations running and people safe.  Finally, I think it's important to reinforce how the Grainger Edge is truly the key to all of the success that I just mentioned. Every day, our purpose, we keep the world working, motivates us to do our best for customers, communities and each other. That commitment has driven a culture we are very proud of and one that's continuously being noticed externally. Recently, Grainger ranked third out of 400 of America's largest companies and the American Opportunity Index for our commitment to developing internal talent drive, business performance and individual growth. The index primarily focuses on the experience of workers and non-college degree roles and the company's ability to offer them growth and development on that of their career path. Additionally, Grainger [indiscernible] Glassdoor's 2024 Best Places to Work. Glassdoor has more than 50 million unique monthly visitors, and this recognition is particularly special as it was first time Grainger was named to Glassdoor's U.S. large employer list. Both of these awards are based on third-party facts or proprietary career databases, not surveys. So they eliminate subjectivity and service a testament to the way that Grainger Edge has strengthen our team member experience and employer brand.  Lastly, before switching to the financials, I want to take a second to announce an update to our 2030 sustainability target. Our target approved by the Board early in the fourth quarter of 2023 seeks to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 by 50% and from a 2018 baseline, up from the previous 30% target. This new goal aligns with the level required to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Environmental stewardship, which has long been a standing focus for Grainger remains a key component of our culture and is embedded with the Grainger Edge in everything we do.  To be clear, our investments in sustainability are profitable as our team has been very resourceful at finding ways to improve our missions while also supporting results.  Turning to Slide 9. We finished the year with over $16.5 billion in sales, up 8.6% on a daily basis or 9.5% in daily organic constant currency amidst the normalizing demand [indiscernible] Growth for the year is highlighted by our high-touch solutions U.S. business, which continued to gain profitable share finishing the year with 525 basis points of market outgrowth, exceeding our annual target of 400 to 500 basis points. Alongside the strong top line, the team also did a great job of managing profitability through the year with operating margins up 130 basis points in 2023, finishing the year at 15.7%. Together, these strong results fueled record earnings ROIC and cash flow. For the year, adjusted EPS was up over 23% to $36.67 per share. ROIC finished at 42.8% and operating cash flow was over $2 billion which allowed us to return $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, these strong results for 2023 are the byproduct of a lot of hard work from our entire team, and I'm very proud of what we've been able to accomplish. As we embark on another year, regardless of what market we face, we are well positioned to continue our momentum and expect to drive great results for our stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.  With that, I will turn it over to Dee.
Deidra Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. And I pause those upfront, everyone. I'm a little [indiscernible] today, so please bear with me. Turning to our [Technical Difficulty] fourth quarter results. We had a solid quarter to finish out the year with profitability coming in stronger than expected, but also reflected some top line softness as we exited the year. For the total company results, daily sales grew 5.1% or 5.5% on a daily organic constant currency basis, which was driven by growth across both segments. Consistent with what we've seen all year, year-over-year top line growth rates continue to moderate as we wrap price pass in the prior year. While sales finished within our implied guidance range for the quarter, we did see more holiday-related softness than anticipated as we ended the quarter.  The total company gross margin for the quarter finished at 39.1%. And declining by 50 basis points over the prior year period. Both segments saw slight year-over-year margin contraction as expected, which I will detail in the coming slides, but in total, finished the quarter at the top end of our implied fourth quarter guidance. Total company operating margin was up 80 basis points which was aided by a lap of roughly $35 million of onetime expenses in the prior year period. When excluding this impact, SG&A as a percentage of sales was still favorable versus prior year by roughly 40 basis points. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $8.33, which was up over 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2022.  Moving on to segment level results. The High Tech Solutions segment continues to perform well, with sells up 4.7% of both the reported and daily organic constant currency basis, fueled by growth across all geographies. Volume growth remains strong and accounts for a vast majority of the overall year-over-year expansion. In the U.S., almost all customer end markets continue to see growth in the fourth quarter with government contractors and health care seeing the strongest year-over-year performance. Canada grew slowly in Q4, driven by a softer macro but the business remains solidly profitable in the quarter and finished 2023 with their most profitable year and over half a decade.  For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.4%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year due to negative price/cost spread a year-end inventory cost adjustments, which included the lap of a prior year LIFO inventory benefit that we did not repeat in 2023. These headwinds were partially offset by the continued supply chain tailwinds we've seen all year as improved product availability and lower fuel and container costs drove year-over-year favorability. Although we were price cost negative in the quarter and for the full year of 2023, we are nearly neutral on a 2-year stack as the timing favorability captured in 2022 as fully unwound and we enter 2024 on a neutral [indiscernible].  At the operating margin line, we saw an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year as the slight GP decline was offset by leverage in the business despite continued investment in marketing and head count to drive long-term growth. As mentioned, the year-over-year SG&A leverage was aided by roughly 90 basis points due to the lap of onetime expenses in the prior year period. Overall, it was another solid quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment, wrapping up a great year.  Looking at market outlook on Slide 13. We estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew in the quarter between 2.5% and 3%, largely driven by price with industrial production, our proxy for volume remaining roughly flat year-over-year. This indicates that the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business achieved roughly 225 basis points of outgrowth in the fourth quarter in total. This more muted quarterly outgrowth reflects higher market-based inflation and Grainger's Q4 price contribution due to the timing of where we pass price versus the market. On a pure volume basis, when looking at our volume contribution versus IP growth our market out growth was closer to 475 basis points.  In any case, as D.G. mentioned, looking at the full year, we achieved an annual outgrowth target by capturing approximately 525 basis points of growth above the market and remain poised to deliver against our target again in 2024.  Moving to our endless assortment segment. Sales increased 6% or 8.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 2.6%, while MonotaRO achieved 9.9% growth in local days local currency. At a business level, Zoro's growth reflects the continuation of headwinds they've experienced all year with declines in noncore B2C volume and slowing macro environment impacting its B2B customers.  B2B customer growth remained steady in the high single digits for the quarter while noncore B2C and B2C light customer performance remained down over 20% year-over-year. At MonotaRO, macro-related headwinds continued to impact results, however, the business still drove strong growth with increased sales to new and enterprise customers while also maintaining strong repeat purchase rate. From a profitability perspective, gross margins in the segment declined 60 basis points versus the prior year as MonotaRO favorability was offset by year-over-year declines at Zoro.  As in the prior quarters, MonotaRO results reflect continued freight efficiencies, while the Zoro decline was driven by negative product mix and the impact of unfavorable timing from prior year price increases. Operating margins for this segment expanded by 50 basis points to 7.8% as the unfavorable gross margin was offset by SG&A leverage aided by the lap of onetime distribution center and commissioning costs in the prior year.  Now looking forward to 2024. We expect to deliver another solid year of performance [indiscernible] more muted MRO market. Our outlook for the year includes revenue to be between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion at the total company level with daily organic constant currency sales growth between 4% and 7%, driven by top line growth in both segments. With our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily organic constant currency sales growth between 3.5% and 6.5%. In the U.S., we're planning for the total MRO market growth to be largely flat with a range of down 0.5% to plus 1.5%. This assumes the flattish volume range coupled with price inflation between 0 and 1%.  On top of this market outlook, we expect to continue executing against our strategic growth engines to achieve 400 to 500 basis points of U.S. market outlook in 2024. In the endless assortment segment, we anticipate daily constant grocery sales to grow between 7% and 10%, which normalizes for the impact of 2 additional business days and expected foreign currency exchange headwinds. MonotaRO is expected to grow in the low double digits in local currency and local gains as they continue to ramp new and enterprise customers [indiscernible] an expected slower macro demand environment. Zoro is anticipated to grow in the mid-single digits as we anticipate that many of the macro-related headwinds impacting their core B2B customers hold over to 2024. We also expect the continued unwind of B2C and B2C like customers, which include resellers and marketplaces to impact results, especially in the first half of the year.  In 2024, the team will focus on growing long-term relationships with its core B2B customers, including work to improve targeted marketing, fine-tune their pricing model and drive consistent service for all of their customers.  Moving to our margin expectations. Even after normalizing to some onetime gross margin benefits we realized in 2023, we expect total company operating margins to remain quite healthy in 2024. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, operating margins will stay relatively flat year-over-year between 17.4% and 17.9%. We expect gross profit margins to be down in 2024 after lapping roughly 50 basis points of onetime benefits captured in 2023.  We anticipate price cost for the year will be the only neutral as we worked our way through the timing discrepancy we've seen over the last couple of years. On the SG&A side, we expect modest leverage while we continue to make incremental investments towards our strategic initiatives to fuel our growth. In endless assortment, we are modeling operating margins to be roughly consistent to what we've seen in the back half of 2023 and 7.3% to 7.8% range as the segment rebaseline following Zoro's revenue declines with the noncore B2C and B2C-like customers.  At the business unit level, Zoro's operating margins are expected to decline, while MonotaRO's operating margins are expected to be neutral for the year.  Turning now to capital allocation. We expect the business will continue to generate strong cash flow in the year with an expected range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, implying operating cash conversion around 100%. We plan to continue to execute a consistent return-driven approach to our capital allocation strategy, meaning our priorities remain largely unchanged from prior years. First, we look at investing in the business and both organic investment and opportunistic M&A. For 2024, we expect capital spending in the range of $400 million to $500 million. Spending here includes continued supply chain expansion in the United States as we worked to [indiscernible] facilities in the Pacific Northwest and the Houston area. We also plan to further invest in our homegrown data and technology capabilities, helping power our growth engines and further our customer value proposition. Lastly, sustainability-related spin remains a priority. We will continue to invest in projects with solid returns to help achieve our emissions targets.  On M&A, we remain highly selective, but are also open to investing in capabilities and acquiring the right assets to further our strategy. And we have a small dedicated team who continually evaluate opportunities in this area. Secondly, we expect to return the balance of our excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As always, we'll formally set our 2024 dividend in the second quarter, but I can say we remain proud of our history of increasing the dividend for 52 consecutive years we expect to do so in day this year. We do not tie our dividend payout to specific metrics. However, we anticipate consistent annual dividend increases in the high single digits to low double-digit percentage range every year.  Lastly, we expect to allocate the balance of our cash flow to share repurchases and anticipate the amount to be between $900 million and $1.1 billion in 2024. We think this return-focused allocation philosophy provides the organization optimal flexibility to efficiently manage investment while maximizing shareholder returns.  In summary, rolling all this up at the total company level, as mentioned, we plan to grow top line by [indiscernible] 4% to 7% on the daily organic constant currency basis. Note that reported sales growth is a bit higher than our daily organic constant currency range as we are normalizing for the divestiture of our [indiscernible] ENR subsidiary, FX changes and the impact of 2 additional selling days in 2024 compared to the prior year.  A reconciliation of these impacts is provided in the appendix of this presentation. Operating margin, as we discussed ranged from 15.3% to 15.8% leading to expected EPS growth of 3.6% to 10.5% or $38 to $40.50 per share. From a seasonality perspective, we do expect both revenue and profitability to be more back half weighted as we move through the year. This includes a softer start in January from the timing of the New Year's holiday and cold weather disruptions experienced mid-month across a large portion of the U.S. With this, January sales started slowly, but picked up momentum as not progress with preliminary results of 4.4% on a daily organic constant currency basis.  On profitability with more muted inflation in the year, we won't see the price timing favorability we normally captured in the first quarter. With this, those margins will show very little seasonality and remain reasonably subsistent with our full year gross margin outlook throughout the year. For SG&A, we expect year-over-year deleverage in the first quarter as we ramp up investment spending in 2024. Leverage will improve each quarter, looking to a tailwind in the back half of the year. Altogether, this will drive EPS growth to be flat to slightly down in the first quarter and will ramp thereafter as the year [indiscernible]  before I hand it back to D.G., I wanted to quickly touch on our long-term outlook and where we expect to take the business over the next several years. As we discussed on our last call, we made great progress towards the 2025 targets we rolled out at our Investor Day in September 2022. We remain on track to hit our revenue goals that are meaningfully ahead on most of our profitability targets. With this, we're replacing our 2025 targets with an updated long-term earnings framework. The framework is actually quite similar to what we've discussed previously, as we continue to target double-digit annual EPS growth in a normalized MRO market, driven by continued strong top line growth, including 400 to 500 basis points of annual market outgrowth in the High-Touch U.S. business and annual growth in the [indiscernible] stable gross profit margins, which should normalize from the 2024 baseline and SG&A growing Florida sales while still investing in demand generation activities to drive sustainable long-term growth. You will notice we made a few tweaks to the earnings framework, which largely offset.  First, we've widened the top line outlook for analyst assortment as each business there is facing dynamics making it harder to achieve historical growth rate. With MonotaRO, at this stage of their maturity, the business has onboarded most of the large and midsized business within the market. With this, the team is pivoting its marketing strategy from firm level of customer acquisition to end user penetration in an effort to expand total customer share win. As though, following the post-pandemic volume decline from B2C and B2C customers, the business is refocusing their efforts on B2B customers as they work to build long-term profitable relationships with the core -- with this core customer set.  As the business be focused, we think it's prudent to widen range of growth outcomes for this segment over the next few years. Regardless, we still expect to deliver very strong growth through this segment and remain confident in the model's ability to continue to take share and drive profitable operating scale to the total business overall. Second, as we [indiscernible] shadowed last quarter, we expect to maintain elevated gross margins in the High-Touch Solutions segment, which is underpinned by the confidence we have in executing against our 2 core pricing [indiscernible] remaining market price competitive while maintaining price cost neutrality.  Adding these together, net-net, we end at roughly the same outlook as we discussed at Investor Day. Strong earnings growing in double digits annually. When we drive these results, the business with [indiscernible] considerable amount of cash, which we will allocate through a consistent and turn driven approach. This includes continuing to invest in the business at an elevated level for the next few years as we add incremental supply chain capacity and continue to build out our technology capability. And all this up, and we think this represents an attractive return profile, we remain well positioned to drive significant value creation for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Grainger continues to build deep trust with our customers as we partner with them to fulfill their MRO needs. While we expect the market in 2024 to be more muted, the Grainger team will continue to focus on what matters advancing our growth drivers to improve the customer experience and providing the exceptional service we are known for. When we live our principles, we can be successful in the man of the cycle. I have full confidence that we will deliver strong results again this year.  With that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair.
Ryan Merkel: I wanted to start with gross margin, and I guess it's a 2-parter. Your gross margins are up about 100 basis points since 2019, and I'm just curious what the drivers are. And then for the '24 guide at the high end, you're holding gross margins flat, but I think, you mentioned 50 basis points of onetime price costs that you're going to have to lap. So what backfills that?
Deidra Merriwether: Let me start with the first question first, and then maybe I'll have you reask the second part of it to make sure I don't forget anything. So when we go back to 2019, I think we've done a pretty good job on just product gross margins in general and being able to prophetize customers based upon the services that we provide from the High-Touch Solutions business. In addition to that, the pricing strategy change has taken allow to be completely executed as we said over a number of years, and that included making sure that we could get pricing right on all of our for -- all of our customers. So some of that evidence also flows into our product GP. And then as of late, we've continued to gain quite a bit of supply chain efficiencies from coming out of the pandemic as well as some other COGS efficiencies related to supplier rebates related to negotiations. Those would be some of the key differences between where we are today and where we were in 2019. So can you repeat your second part of the question for me, please?
Ryan Merkel: Yes. The guidance for gross margins in '24, it's flat at the high end at 39.4%. And I think you mentioned you'll be lapping 50 basis points of onetime price cost help in '23. So what are the offsets? .
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. So some of the offsets we made to the fact that as we go into this year, we're going to have a faster pricing environment. And based upon that, we want to make sure that we're providing a range such that is realistic for us to hit also in a softer volume environment for the overall business. And so those are some of the 2 primary reasons why being officially flat we would expect to be closer to the high end. We've got some tailwinds that will continue to normalize after some of the disruptions that we've had over the past few years, specific to supply chain and mix, and that will help as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens.
Thomas Moll: I wanted to expand on the gross margin conversation with what's perhaps the obligatory question here. But I just want to make sure that I'm tracking the message correctly over time. So if we go back to your Investor Day, the anchor for your high-touch business was in that 40% range. Since that time, you've outperformed it significantly and indicated that maybe that was too low a number. And if I'm hearing the message correctly today, in 2024 at the midpoint, you're somewhere a little bit north of 41% and 25% and thereafter stable around that range. So I just want to make sure I've tracked all that correctly or if there's anything you'd like to amend there.
Donald Macpherson: You've tracked that. I think you tracked that correctly. The only other thing I would add is that when we -- during the Investor Day when we said 40%, I think we probably knew that there was -- the supply chain efficiencies is a big bucket. We probably knew that there was a lot of inefficiency. I think we probably maybe have been surprised at how much in efficiency and as we've gotten back to normal, that's been a big a big tailwind for us. And so we probably -- if we had known, it was just difficult to see all that. We probably would have had a higher number of back then as well.
Thomas Moll: Sure. Pivoting to the commentary you offered today on service levels earlier in your remarks, D.G. So it sounds like you're back to roughly your own pre-pandemic service levels. You've invested and will invest substantially in the capacity and automation and other areas as well. So I'm just curious, strategically, do you feel more confident in leaning into these forms of investment and versus what you've communicated in the past, should we read from today that with that increased confidence, you see this as a repeatable and sustainable advantage that you can repeat pretty consistently to take share?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. And I appreciate the question. In terms of returning to near normal service, I would say everything that we directly control is back to normal in terms of our own internal cycle times transportation is back to normal. There's still some elongated supplier lead times, which is the reason we're still probably a little shy of where we were. But from a competitive standpoint, that's all that really matters is a competitive standpoint, we're doing quite well. In terms of the investments we're making, we're filling in gaps where we've grown to the point where having buildings in those locations make sense. And they make sense not only to improve service, but to improve cost in some perspective. So if you think about the Northwest. Most of our product today comes out of California has to clear the mountains and get in there and that's a long haul. We now have enough volume to be able to improve the service dramatically in the Northwest and actually lower transportation cost pretty substantially. So we look at all those factors, service and cost and when we make these decisions, but we're very confident in what we've outlined and announced so far that those are the right things to do for the health of the business.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Jake Levinson with Melius Research.
Jacob Levinson: Good morning, everyone. I know you have some margin headwinds here in '24, and there's been obviously a lot of improvement in the last couple of years. But just on the on the productivity side, I know these you touched on a couple of levers earlier in your prepared remarks, but can you just help us get a sense of the levers that you have or maybe where you're most focused here in '24 that can help offset some of those headwinds?
Donald Macpherson: I mean I'll start and Dee, if you want to add in, you can. I think the thing to note is that we tend to look at productivity from a core productivity standpoint. So distribution centers, contact centers, seller productivity, all those levers. And we really see opportunity across the business. And I think we're going to see really nice core productivity this year. The headwinds are more around the growth investments, which we think are absolutely the right thing to do, they're high return growth investments. But we are spending more money in marketing and we're investing in the sales force. And so those things make it -- the headline number looked a little more challenging. And it's a time in place when we are investing in those things and believe that's the right thing to do. But we're going to continue to get core productivity. It's an evergreen initiative for us to look everywhere in the business. And I think we've got a whole bunch of things teed up to improve the productivity of the core business.
Jacob Levinson: That makes sense. And your comment about the 35% expansion in the square footage in your supply chain -- square footage isn't everything, maybe that's not the best way to measure it. But is that really you guys catching up to the growth you've seen over the last couple of years or preparing for the next couple of years or maybe it's a mix, but just trying to get [Technical Difficulty].
Donald Macpherson: It's a mix. It's a mix. And I think it just practically, if you thought about it, we're a lot bigger than 2019. There was almost no way to actually build buildings productively during the pandemic, you couldn't get things going. And so we were a little bit behind. We talked about that in 2022. So a part of it is catch-up but a part of it is planning for the future growth as well. And I would say the square footage isn't exactly capacity because the bulk warehouse portion of those is lower cost and doesn't quite give you as much capacity as does the other buildings, but certainly, Houston and Portland are added capacity similar to the other capacity of the number.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of David Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: First off, a couple of quick ones for Dee. What specifically is the range of price expectations you're baking into the 2024 guidance range? And second, on Slide 20, you talked about stable gross margins. I'm not clear if you're referring to segment gross margins are consolidated. Could you help me with that?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. So Dave, I will start with the U.S. price that we're focusing on when you think about that outline of flattish, we're expecting price to be between 0% to 1% for the year in the U.S. And on Slide 20, specifically, stable gross margins really is applying to the total company, and you can also apply that to High-Touch in some ways as well.
David Manthey: And then, D.G., could you talk about what opportunistic M&A would look like to Grainger today?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean first and foremost, I would reiterate that we are an organic growth company, and that's where we are focused on most of our energy. We get a lot of looks at things and opportunities. I would say that we get 2 types of looks of the distributors, which probably haven't been as interesting to us. And then there are some potential technology investments and things that might be more interesting to us. So we continue to look at a wide range of opportunities in areas that we think are really important to the success of the business, particularly some specific domains that we think we need to be really good at going forward, and we might invest in those areas. But as I said, we are primarily an organic growth company at this point.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.
Christopher Snyder: I wanted to ask on the investments that the company are making. And D.G., I appreciate all the color that you provided. And there's a lot going on, but is there any way that you could maybe bucket or talk about the investments between the capacity additions and the efficiency drivers that you're making versus the more demand generative investments like the sales coverage and the marketing. Any way to just kind of think of those 2 respective buckets?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So without getting overly detailed, I would say that the demand generation investments are typically SG&A investments, so marketing and seller ads or SG&A investments. Whereas a lot of the capacity investments we're making in productivity investments or AI investments or technology investments, most of this showing capital, some shows up in expense for sure. But if you think about -- when we talk about spending $450 million, $550 million in capital, the vast majority of that comes from supply chain investments and capacity increases and in technology. And so I would think of it in those terms. And technology is building capabilities and advantage in information assets and supporting the growth initiatives in the core business as well versus marketing to our more direct spend that go into demand generation.
Christopher Snyder: I appreciate that. And then if we think of the SG&A investments, that are kind of more of that demand generation. Can you just maybe talk about the ability to leverage those and grow operating margin over time? Because in 2024 has guided to be a pretty supportive year for gross margin, but operating margin is kind of flattish despite the top line growth and the stable gross margin because it seems like in some capacities, investments that you're making, do you think that over time, you're able to leverage those and grow operating margin? And then maybe '24 is just kind of a pause year.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, it talked about it. Yes, we do expect to get SG&A leverage over time, and we are probably making more incremental investments in this year than others. Yes. So that is probably true. We're also -- just I would just point out, in a fairly flat price environment, that SG&A is -- its more difficult to get SG&A leverage as well. So there's a number of factors going on. Dee, do you have any?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. The other thing I would point to is just our improvement in return on invested capital. I think that was one of the reasons why that's one of the metrics that we talk about track and are focused on is ensuring that the investments we make, whether they are CapEx investments or SG&A based upon how we calculate ROIC, we are very focused on ensuring that they help us deliver and grow at least not operating margin, operating dollar growth as well for us.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. And the other thing I'd add to that is that both in marketing and seller coverage, we are very well measured. So we are -- everything is tested. We don't make the investments lightly. We know exactly what returns are getting. So if they're a positive return, we will make them even if in the year, they might slow down our SG&A leverage because it is the right thing to do for the overall profitability of the business.
Christopher Snyder: I appreciate that. All makes sense. And if I can squeeze one last one in. When I look at price mix in the quarter for high touch, I think it was only up 40 basis points I have to think that customer mix was a drag on that. I guess any color on what that customer mix headwind was? And any way to maybe think about what price as a stand-alone was in Q4?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. I mean it was really small. And I think if you go back to -- we forecast -- and it should be no surprise with our price cost outcome will be in Q4. We've been looking at this and talking about it for the last 2 years. If you go back to 2022, we noted that we were going to be significantly price cost positive in that year, and it would unwind in 2023 and it did, and you saw that and experience that in the second half of of 2023. And so a lot of it is timing, as we know we talked about price and cost in our business is very lumpy being north of 70% of our business will contract customers and the timing of those things. And so on a 2-year stack being essentially neutral and exiting this year and start in 2024, the neutral footing, I think was really important.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Love to go a little bit deeper on the comments about January getting off to a slower start. And we've heard this recently from a number of companies pointing to the weather as really hampering some of the activities. So if you could size for us what you think that weather impact was. And a related question is the underlying assumption of MRO for activity for 2024, down 0.5% to up 1.5%. Just given the trends we're seeing now in the ISM coming back, new orders going back above 50, just it seems like you could see a risk to the upside in that and maybe that's a bit conservative and just take us through that assumption as well, please.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, sure. So I can take the -- I mean, I can try to take both of them. I guess the first one I think there were 2 factors that made January slow start. One was that most of the schools were shut, which show some activity in the first week of January, which last year, schools opened in midweek. And we noticed that and we noticed that in some of the schools we serve as well as just the broader economy. And then obviously, the cold weather week. What I would say is that the last 2 weeks of January were very normal for us. And so while there was some slowness, it wasn't -- in the course of the quarter, it will be very, very small in terms of the impact, but noticeable in a month, of course, because it's many weeks, but it's not huge in the grand scheme of things, it's just noise. And so we don't -- we won't focus too much on that.  I think any forecast for the MRO market any year, I think you could argue could be risk to the upside or downside, I don't know. This is our current forecast, and we have economists internally and external that we look at, and this is the forecast they have right now. So that's what we're going with. But that too will always change and it will never be right until we know that. So again, we want to over-index on the forecast.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then for Dee or D G. either. The outlook for an expected increase in buybacks for 2024, the uptick there. Just what's the expectation in terms of the pace of the buybacks through the year?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. We've been fairly consistent for a number of years in our buyback practices generally under the vail of overall capital allocation strategy and we look to be in the market all the time based upon what the price of shares are. We don't try to time the market from a price perspective, but always looking to be into the market buying shares. And so generally, we have pretty stable pace across the year for the share buybacks.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Congrats on all the significant workplace culture recognitions, indicator of your durability. So I was curious what you're seeing in terms of product cost deflation that you always try to drive as distinctive from, I think you called out, there's some continuing benefits from the macro level supply chain normalization.
Deidra Merriwether: So this is the -- we've gone from a as you know, over the last year or so a highly cost inflationary environment to something that is much more muted today -- coming down today are much more reasonable or normalized is the term I would use is what we're seeing. I would say, our product management team, utilizes the same sets of strategic and tactical activities with our supply base. We want to remain to be a customer of choice for them. And so we're working to ensure that we continue to have advantage price and advantaged access to products at the best price possible. So things are getting to more normal level for us today.
Christopher Glynn: Great. And then on the B2C side of Zoro, I think you mentioned that the unwind there, the headwind would be first half weighted and suggest more neutral comps in the back half. So does that mean you're exiting '23 at about the sustainable mix?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So I think what I would say there is that, obviously, as the B2C and B2C like volume shrinks, it becomes less of an impact on the rest of the business and our business customer activity has actually been reasonably healthy through the entire quarter. We do expect some of the decline to be less impactful in the back half of the year. So we should have less drag in the back half of the year than we have in the first half of the year from the decline B2C lifeline.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Ken Newman: I know there's a lot of moving pieces here, but I am wondering if you are seeing or have seen any impact from some of the [indiscernible] shipping dynamics and how are you thinking about shipping and screen expenses in '24 and how that flows through your OpEx guide for the year?
Donald Macpherson: So on the Red Sea, we don't have much volume going through that -- those lanes. Most of our shipping volume comes out of Asia through to the West Coast and then as railed to our network. And so that has not been impacted. So we've really seen nothing there. Could you repeat the second half of your question? .
Ken Newman: Yes. Just curious, as a follow-up to that, how you're thinking about freight expenses in general. I feel -- I think most companies are seeing those kind of come up here? And how do you see that flowing through your OpEx line as it relates to your guide for the year? .
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean much of our freight, most of our freight actually goes into our gross profit line, but we -- our forecasts haven't changed much given the activity we've seen, given the lines we're in. Certainly, things like fuel increases can have an impact and who knows how that's going to play out. But right now, we're actually still in a favorable position relative to a year ago -- certainly on ocean freight at this point. So we expect that to continue through the first part of the year, and then we'll see what happens.
Ken Newman: Got it. And then if I could just squeeze one more in here. I think you mentioned in the new framework that you expect Zoro and MonotaRO to kind of get back to that low teens type of growth range. It's been a tougher couple of years here recently. As I think about the seasonality comments on the first half year kind of unwinding in the first half, is it reasonable to say, could you get back to that double -- low double-digit range here within the back half of '24? Or is that more of a 25% type of aspirational target?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, it's probably more of a 25% -- so to be clear, MonotaRO this year, we'll be hitting that already, we think it's low double-digit low teens. So that will be close to that for the year. And then Zoro will start the year lower than that, and we expect them to get a bit better as the year goes along. We probably won't get there by this year, but that would be more in out years, we think that's the target.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan.
Patrick Baumann: Just had a couple of questions for Dee on the price timing comments that you noted. Maybe if you could help us better understand first what you said with respect to Slide 13. Did the market take up price in the fourth quarter and you waited for the new year? Or was this something like in the comps that caused that disparity?
Deidra Merriwether: No. No. I think your -- Slide 13, you're kind of looking at what we have listed as what we think the market performance has been by quarter.
Patrick Baumann: It was about the fourth quarter, you had like you noted like a volume share gain of $475.
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. And so that difference is really that our price in the quarter was lower than the PMI print in the quarter. And so we were just highlighting for you that if you just look at the volume for IP versus our volume, then our share gain would have been 4.75. So there's a difference in the market price as published today in Q4 versus what we realized from a price perspective. And the comments I was making earlier about timing is that our timing is not always going to be in line with the timing of price in the market. And this quarter was just one example of that. But you also have other examples if you look back over the course of several other quarters as we've outperformed the market. So we try to look at it on a 2-year stack, trying to get to neutral over a longer period of time.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. And then my follow-up as it relates to the first quarter, I think you also mentioned something about price timing as a factor for gross margins being kind of down year-over-year. So curious if you can give some more color on that, too, like did you put through price early last year and you're not doing the same thing this year? Or is it something else? .
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. So no, we always put through price if prices warranted early in the year, but it's more like a seasonality question. So I'll probably respond to it in that way. We do expect a lot of the outlook that we've given for 2024 to be back-end weighted. We talked a little bit about pieces of it, which was sales starting slower, tougher comp. Q1 last year was a very strong year for us, which included a whole lot of price in that quarter with a price outlook of 0 to 1. Of course, our price for this year, the quarter will be more muted versus that. And we expect price to become more favorable throughout the year and for gross margins to be relatively stable versus the outlook that we have given. And so that's what I mean when you talk about kind of sales and price in the first quarter versus the prior year.
Donald Macpherson: Just to add to that, I think the practical reality was that if you think back to 2022, we took a budget price midyear that from a 2023 Q1 to 2022 Q1 comparison made 2023 have very high price increases relative to the year before because we took them in the middle of the year and those -- so it wasn't all taken January 1 last year, but all the inflation run up in 2022 made last year look a little unusual from a first quarter price increase.
Deidra Merriwether: Q1 and full year.
Donald Macpherson: Q1 and full year. Absolutely.
Operator: Our final questions will come from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Sound like suffering. So I feel -- if you repeat yourself here. But just on the seasonality comment, are you saying gross margins much flatter from quarter-to-quarter through the year. Obviously, normally, we see a bit of a seasonal pattern there. So is that the comment? And does that therefore imply that as we go from 4Q to 1Q, we've got a pretty flat Q2Q gross margin structure then. And if it is flattered, I just want to understand why that is. I mean, I get the fact that price is coming through a bit stronger for the year. But any other factors we need to consider? .
Deidra Merriwether: Well, like we've talked a little bit about freight. We'll continue to get freight and supply chain efficiencies and some product mix. But again, it all starts with the fact that we don't expect to have a lot of price in the market this year, just generally so. We expect gross margins to be reasonably consistent from what we talked about all through the year. So that's the basic reason for that muted price.
Nigel Coe: Okay. That's fair. And then the comment you made about SG&A. I think you mentioned some SG&A deleverage in the first quarter. So again, it sounds like the model is here is going to be pretty clean in terms of -- it sounds like SG&A can be pretty flat across the quarters, maybe is that the way you're seeing it? We got some front-end other investments this year?
Deidra Merriwether: So yes. So yes, SG&A is going to deleverage in the first quarter because we're going to continue, as noted, to ramp our investments in marketing and sellers and others and the like. But we do expect leverage will improve as the year progress, flipping to more of a tailwind in the back half of the year for us. And then just if you kind of move down a little bit, we think operating margin in Q1 will be at its lowest point as well and EPS will be flattish year-over-year in the first quarter as well.
Nigel Coe: Got it year-over-year. Okay. Got it. And since some last question, I feel like maybe I can just squeeze one more in, if I can. Just I want to just clarify the customer mix comment from earlier on in the call. I mean, I noticed the medium-sized customers outgrew large customers. So I'd assume that mix would have been positive, but if I'm wrong [indiscernible] now.
Deidra Merriwether: I missed that last part. I heard you say that. Could you repeat it? .
Nigel Coe: The customer mix. I assume that maybe customer mix was slightly positive given that medium-sized with large size dynamic. But if I'm wrong there, please let me know.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I think it was basically neutral. We did have -- you're right, midsize customers did grow faster than the largest customers. Overall, it was not a meaningful impact, as I understand it. Dee and I are in different rooms, so she's sequestered. So we're looking at each other through a camera here.
Operator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to D.G. MacPherson for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: All right. Sorry, we're a few minutes over. Thanks for joining the call. What I would say is that and we're certainly proud of the results we had in 2023. We are very focused on continuing to drive forward and create value for our customers in 2024 and a lot of that is really the same despite the more muted growth in the market that a lot of that's just a continuation of driving forward the initiatives that matter, both from a growth perspective and a productivity perspective. And we remain very positive about the outlook and our ability to gain share profitably for years to come. So thanks for the time. Hope you all have a great weekend. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
Kyle Bland : Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Vice President and CFO.  As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q3 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website.  This morning's call will focus on our third quarter 2023 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for all periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements.  Now I'll turn it over to D.G. 
D.G. Macpherson : Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter performance and then pass it to Dee to walk through our results in detail. As I typically do, I'd like to start today's call with some reflections on how our Grainger Edge framework continues to drive our success. Unlike last year, our results in 2023 have not benefited from outsized macro tailwinds and we don't expect this to change for the remainder of the year as MRO market volume growth remained slightly negative. This means we must emphasize the value we bring through our customer experience and supply chain network to drive profitable share gain.  I've recently had the opportunity to spend time with several manufacturing and government customers in California. While the first on their operations, it was clear that our advantaged supply chain, strong digital capabilities and ability to solve complex problems adding value for these customers. All of this is helping us to continue to gain share.  Before we get into the results, I want to share a few examples of how our team members continually deliver our principles and improve the communities where we operate. Last month, our team members assembled more than 4,000 buckets to help natural disaster victims across the U.S. These buckets were strategically placed in regions vulnerable to hurricanes and flooding to ensure residents are prepared to quickly respond when a crisis hits.  And for the second year in a row, Grainger has been recognized as one of Fortune's Best Places to Work for Women. This recognition is based on team member responses to key questions based on trust, respect, credibility, fairness, pride and camaraderie. We know that when team members till heard and recognized, we unlock the full potential of our team and the full potential of our business.  Now let's dive into the quarter.  On Slide 5, you can see we had another strong quarter as demand stayed reasonably steady as we continue to provide strong service and deliver tangible value to our customers. We finished the quarter with sales growth of 6.7% or 8.7% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by positive performance in both segments, most notably within the High-Touch Solutions segment, where we continue to drive profitable share gain.  Total company operating margin was 15.9%, an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year, has improved gross margin performance driven by continued freight and supply chain efficiencies, along with favorable product mix, largely fell to the bottom line. Combine this with our strong top line performance, and we delivered another quarter of robust EPS growth, record operating cash flow and strong ROIC of over 44%. We also returned a total of $287 million to Grainger shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.  In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we are advancing our 5 key growth engines as we continue to leverage our technology and data assets to unlock further value for customers. We remain focused on extending our service advantage and officially broke ground on our previously announced distribution center outside of Portland which we expect will help enhance our service performance in the Pacific Northwest. Within the Endless Assortment business, while we continue to see a softer demand environment, we remain focused on acquiring new customers and improving repeat purchase rates across the segment driving long-term profitable growth. Overall, 2023 is shaping up to be another great year as we follow the Grainger Edge, make progress on our strategy and drive value for customers. We remain on track to deliver over 20% earnings growth for shareholders.  And with that, I'll pass it to Dee to go through the details. 
Dee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. On Slide 7, you can see the high-level results for the total company, including strong sales growth of 8.7% on a daily constant currency basis driven by growth across both segments. This is a relatively stable growth rate compared to the second quarter, even as price contribution declined as we wrap inflation pass in the prior year period.  Total company operating margin was up 60 basis points, primarily due to expanded gross margin in High-Touch, which more than offset lower EA gross margin and slight SG&A deleverage across the business. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.43, which was up over 14% versus the third quarter of 2022.  Moving on to segment level results. The High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well, with sales up 8.5% in daily constant currency underpinned by growth across all geographies. Volume accelerated sequentially and contributed 6 percentage points of growth, excluding price contribution for the first time in 5 quarters.  In the U.S., we continue to drive year-over-year growth in all customer in segments with government and transportation growing faster. Canadian daily sales were strong, up 9.1% in local days in local currency. For this segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. We continue to benefit from improved product availability, which drove freight and supply chain efficiencies in the quarter.  Product mix also remained a tailwind, partially driven by an outsized number of project-related value-added services in the current year period, a level which we don't expect to repeat going forward. As expected, price/cost spread was negative as the timing favorability captured in 2022 continues to unwind. This price/cost trend will continue in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate finishing nearly neutral on a 2-year stack for the full year 2022 and 2023 combined.  At the operating line, we saw improvement of 70 basis points year-over-year as GP favorability was partially offset by continued marketing and headcount investments to drive long-term growth. SG&A leverage was further impacted by one less selling day in the current year period. Overall, it was another strong quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment.  Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 2.5% and 3.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 550 basis points of outgrowth for the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business in the quarter. Performance remains above our annual target to outgrow the market by 400 basis points to 500 basis points, driven by consistent execution across our 5 growth engines. We continue to remain confident in our ability to achieve our annual outlook target through any economic cycle.  Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 4.3% or 9.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjust for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 1.2%, while MonotaRO achieved 12.6% growth in local days, local currency. At the business level, while we're seeing some signs of macro-related softness at MonotaRO, the business still drove strong growth with new and enterprise customers and remain focused on growing repeat business with its core B2B customer.  At Zoro results reflect a continuation of headwinds discussed last quarter with tough prior year comp decline was noncore B2C volume and a slowing macro environment all contributing to more muted top line growth. Noncore B2C customer performance was down nearly 20% year-over-year as we continue to focus our growth efforts on stickier B2B customers. Core B2B customer growth remains in the high single digits for the quarter and continues to reflect a slower macro for small businesses and in end markets where Zoro is more skewed. We expect these pressures to persist for at least the balance of the year.  From a profitability perspective, gross margin for the segment declined 20 basis points versus the prior year as MonotaRO favorability was offset by year-over-year declines at Zoro. MonotaRO results reflect continued freight efficiencies and strong price realization in the quarter while the Zoro decline was driven by negative product mix and the impact of unfavorable timing from prior year price increases. These gross margin headwinds coupled with the continued demand generation investments in softer Zoro top line drove a 70 basis point decline in operating margins for the segment.  On Slide 11, we continue to propel the Endless Assortment flywheel as we add new users and grow our SKU count. Total registered users were up 15% in total across the segment, and we continue to grow our assortment at Zoro having added roughly 600,000 SKUs in the quarter, pushing the portfolio total to over 12.8 million products offered.  Now looking forward to the rest of the year, you can see that we've narrowed our guidance ranges for the full year 2023. The new outlook includes total company daily sales growth between 8.5% and 9.5% and an EPS range between $36 and $36.60. These updated figures imply a Q4 daily sales growth between 4.5% and 8.5%, which includes 4% month-to-date growth in October, which is in line with our expectations and reflects a total comparison given hurricane-related sales in the prior year. This month-to-date growth is roughly 100 basis points higher in constant currency.  From a margin perspective, we are raising the lower end of our ranges and now expect operating margin for the full year to be between 15.6% and 15.7%, a record year for the total company. The new range implies fourth quarter operating margin will be lower sequentially as we anticipate product mix to normalize with fewer value-added service engagement and SG&A margin to delever in line with typical seasonality in the fourth quarter. Supplemental guidance covering cash flow and share repurchase expectations, which have also been increased can be found in the appendix of the presentation. All told, we're pleased to achieve full year results that includes the absorbed price for sales, profitability and cash flow further strengthening of our track record of delivering strong returns for Grainger shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks. 
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. Before we close out, I wanted to quickly reflect on the tremendous progress that we've made over the years since our Investor Day last fall. As you may recall, we outlined an earnings framework that got us to some attractive 3-year targets that included us delivering strong top line growth, ramping to record operating margins and producing double-digit EPS growth through 2025. With the 2023 guidance you just outlined, even if you were to normalize for some of the onetime benefits elevating our margins this year, we are trending favorably towards the 2025 targets.  As we look beyond 2023, the core tenets of this earnings framework remain intact. We will continue to focus on maximizing earnings dollars generation by delivering strong top line growth, maintaining healthy gross margins, which we expect are going to stabilize after adjusting for the onetime benefits we realized in 2023 and gaining expense leverage by growing SG&A slower than sales. Executing against this framework positions us well to deliver attractive returns and consistently produce double-digit EPS growth for our shareholders.  With that, we will open up the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. 
Ryan Merkel : Nice quarter. I wanted to start with a high-level question on gross margin, if I could. I think your guidance for gross margin '25 is 37% and you're a good bit above that here, 39% plus. Can you tell us why your gross margins are so much higher than the expectation you laid out at the Investor Day? 
Dee Merriwether: Ryan, this is Dee. Thanks for your question. Like, if you kind of go back in time and think about where we were about a year ago, we were in the midst of kind of coming out of the pandemic. Product availability was not exactly where we wanted it to be, even though our relative performance was pretty good. And we were expecting to get back in line with product availability much later in this year. That snapped forward really quickly in Q1, and it helped us significantly improve our margins. That's one piece.  The other piece I will point you to is we target price cost neutrality over time. And last year around that time, we expected cost to come in a lot sooner than what they did this year. We had passed price earlier last year in anticipation of that cost. Costs really are now flowing through GP as we expected. So a lot of things are timing related. We do -- we are performing better than what we had anticipated at that time, but really it's due to product availability, price/cost timing as we continue to focus on neutrality. And then we've continued to do very well as it relates to freight and supply chain efficiencies. That was also another timing element. 
Ryan Merkel : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a question on trends. Government looks like it's performing very well, transport, same thing, maybe just unpack what the drivers are there? And then can you put a fine point on the October, I think you mentioned 4% month-to-date growth, and that's down from September that's closer to 9%? Just what's going on there? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So government, I think a lot of that. Government has been very strong across the board. We have won some new contracts that have come on board that have helped us this year. And so that has been certainly a tailwind. When we say transportation, I think, arguably, we mean aerospace there. Aerospace has been very, very strong. I think the aerospace companies can't build enough airplanes now. So we're benefiting from that. And I would say the market in general remains stable. There's puts and takes, but those two have been certainly on the plus side for us.  In terms of the 4% in growth that we've seen through October so far, there's a couple of things going on there. One is our market share gain, we think, is going to be pretty strong in October, but we did have Hurricane Ian basically generated a lot of startle and other sales last year for us. And so that compare makes the month look a little worse than it actually it is. The underlying volumes are actually still quite good. 
Dee Merriwether: And as it relates to the second part of your question, related to the October month-to-date top line growth at 4% and versus our implied for Q4 being in the range of 4.5% to 8.5%. I'll point you to one thing. This time last year, we did support sale-through of products for the recovery related to the Hurricane Ian. And so we are in a period where we're cycling a tougher comp but as the quarter moves on, comps will get easier. So we feel pretty good about the range that we've laid out for the quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. 
Tommy Moll : D.G., you used the phrase reasonably steady to characterize the demand environment. So my question is, if you could unpack that a little bit or offer any helpful anecdotes, the revenue guidance or the range was -- midpoint rather moves slightly lower. I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but is there anything behind that worth calling out? Or is it FX noise or something else? 
D.G. Macpherson: Well, I think the reality is the volume this year, the volume in the market has been near 0, pretty much all year. And so all of our volume share gain -- all volume pluses have been share gain, that will continue. I think the biggest difference is moving through the fourth quarter. We had price that happened last year that has been an increase in our revenue line for the first three quarters, but we lapped that going into the fourth quarter. So we don't really see any changes. There's nothing to be made up, but this is exactly how we predicted the year to play out and it's playing out pretty much exactly as we expected. So we are not at all concerned about the revenue line. It's exactly what we expected. 
Tommy Moll : Great. And then shifting back to gross margins and specifically around the High-Touch segment. I know 40% is still the official long-term anchor there, and it may be prudent to wait to revise that. But could you even walk us maybe qualitatively from the 41.7% that you just reported in 3Q to how that may progress for 4Q and even into early next year? 
Dee Merriwether: Sure. So you're right, it feels a little early for us to start resetting things. At this point, which I've kind of reiterated the last couple of quarters. But what I would say related to High-Touch and if you compare really Q3 to where we think we're going to go sequentially Q4, I will call out, like in my prepared remarks that we've mentioned our service-related or product mix. That happened as a benefit both in Q2 and in Q3. We don't expect that to continue into Q4. In addition to that, there are some other pieces like that fall into the price cost related to rebates last year. Both years we're doing very good in volume as D.G. noted, but again, volume was really strong last year, still very strong, and then that reset some of your rebates. And so that will kind of fall off a little bit and then price/cost will continue to unwind, Q3 to Q4. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. 
Jacob Levinson : Just touching on the margins. I know you talked about some favorable items you have this year, and you're certainly trending well above those 2025 targets that you laid out, but D.G. or Dee, for that manner, maybe you can just give us a sense of how you're thinking about operating leverage in the business going forward because it -- I would think at least that the growth is there that you're probably not going to see margins contracting meaningfully, even if mix was a little bit worse or price/cost is a little bit worse? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean -- so what I would say is that the adjustments that -- once you take out the adjustments that you talked about, we believe that the High-Touch model will be relatively stable moving forward. And we are trending favorable to kind of targets as we talked about. The earnings model is share gain and stable gross margins and grow SG&A slower than sales, that formula is not going to change, and we expect to be able to continue to do that moving forward. 
Jacob Levinson : Okay. That's helpful. And just switching gears, I think your balance sheet is probably the least levered maybe since you took over D.G., is that reflecting some conservatism on the macro? Or is there appetite for more aggressive share buybacks or special dividend or otherwise returning more cash to shareholders? 
Dee Merriwether: You are correct. We are very fortunate to have a strong balance sheet. And at the time, based upon our cash flow generation, we don't see a significant need to further lever the business, use the word conservatism. You can use that word. But we don't see a big need right now for that. Now based upon our cash flow generation, our access to capital, if there ever becomes a need for that, we feel like we are well positioned to go into the capital markets to help us with anything. But right now, based upon our operating cash flow and conversion, we feel like we're in a good place with leverage. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. 
Christopher Glynn : I was curious on HTS price/cost dynamics, a couple of components. What was price in the quarter? And then is it holding well in the baseline? Looking fine on market competitive pricing to expect neutral price/cost margin impact in '24 like the algorithm? 
Dee Merriwether: So just to answer your first question, price/cost for High-Touch was 2.5% in the quarter. And again, we take a longer-term view of price competitiveness, remaining price competitive. And due to the lumpiness of all of the components of price and costs that impact the business, if you look at a 2-year stack, we expect to be close to neutral if you accrue '22 and '23. I would say that would be looking ahead, we would not change that position. We are targeting price cost neutrality over time. When we get to early next year and set the 2024 guide, we'll talk in more detail about 2024. 
D.G. Macpherson: The only thing I'd add to that is that we are not seeing a lot of product cost pressure relative to what we've seen in the last few years. As you might expect, there's been a lot of puts and takes, but generally, we're not expecting a lot of product cost inflation heading into the new year. True. 
Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then on Zoro and MonotaRO, just curious how you're thinking about path back to the kind of 16% to 18% long-term top line targets? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So what I'd say is Zoro grew -- I'm sorry, MonotaRO grew to about 13% in the quarter. The Japanese market has not been strong. We've been dealing with some inflation for the first time really, in anybody's memory there. I have a lot of confidence that the team is going to be on the right track to continue to deliver strong growth, whether that's approaching 20 like they've done over the last 20 years or something less than that is probably debatable. But there's absolutely no concerns about the performance of that business.  In Zoro, we've seen some competitors to Zoro actually go negative in the last couple of quarters in terms of revenue. And so that has had an impact. The market certainly has had an impact on Zoro. I think you talked about it. The core B2B sales were up high single digits at this point, which is not where we want to be, but not horrible. There's a lot of other factors going on, particularly consumer business that's falling off, and we want that to fall off. But there's a lot of things we're working on that business to continue to get more repeat business out of customers, and we need to get better and better at that, and the team is working to do that. And that will be the real key to us being successful with growth long term as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. 
David Manthey : My question was along the same lines on Zoro. So I guess I'll try to refine it a bit here. D.G., what you just said in terms of the trends, it sounds like the -- what you're seeing there right now is primarily cyclical in nature. You're not concerned about the strategy there. But then you also said that you are implementing strategic moves to grow that business. Could you just outline a couple of those for us, so we know what the drivers are? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So what I would say is there's two pieces to growth to Zoro. One is that this a very simplified, but one is acquiring customers, Zoro has always been really good at acquiring customers. They've been a good customer acquisition engine. The other is developing repeat business for those customers, so you become the place of choice to shop. We've had some success with that. We have a lot of long-term customers. We need to get better at that piece. So most of what we're talking about doing is how to make alterations, it's not really a strategy change, but we're testing a bunch of things to figure out how to improve that part of the business. And that will be the big area of focus going forward. 
David Manthey : Got it. Okay. And then on the High-Touch side, product and customer information tools have really been a key driver of the outperformance there. Can you update us -- I don't know if you have statistics on the Salesforce's use of those tools or if you've added any new capabilities lately to those applications? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean I think that -- let's start with -- as you know, we are building some of our own software for the first time in a long time and customer information and product information were early in the cycle. Product information, in particular, with a core publishing system that we've developed to help the website, help customer positivity on our website, and this helped really drive a lot of growth through both marketing and merchandising.  The customer information system is supporting marketing efforts. It's also supporting seller coverage, which we have been adding sellers and that help us understand where we can add and become more refined in that. So both of those have been a big driver of growth and will continue to be so going forward. And I think that we still have a long ways to go, particularly customer information to leverage it for all of our sales team and all of our marketing activities, but we continue to get better in those areas. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. 
Nigel Coe : So looking at this -- the fourth quarter margin, Dee, you called out, I think, 50 basis points or thereabouts of sequential margin kind of versus third quarter. Is that math correct, first of all? And then how does that shake out between High-Touch and Endless Assortment? And then I've got a follow-on on the Zoro gross margins as well. 
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So you're talking about a sequential change from Q3 to…? 
Nigel Coe : Yes, 3Q to 4Q gross margin. 
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So total company is about 60 bps. And again, I think -- I know that the pieces are the same. And so the favorability that we saw in Q2 and Q3 related to some services, project related revenue, which is accretive to the business. At a total company level, that's about 40 bps and as High-Touch, that's about 60 bps. And then the other piece I called out, which is really related to some smaller headwinds related to price/cost and some -- that flows through rebates, that's about another 20 basis point total company and round up to close to that on the High-Touch level as well. 
Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just to calibrate the comments about price/cost normalization. We're no longer looking at 40% gross margin High-Touch, you're thinking you maintain a higher plateau than that? 
Dee Merriwether: What we've said and what D.G. set out reiterate that is we've had some onetime benefits if you look at this year. Earlier in the year, we had a freight accrual-related benefit. We had a supplier rebate benefit that we won't see going forward. And then this product mix, which is related to supplier related services -- not supplier, services-related project benefit. When you pull all that together, that's like a 40 basis point headwind year-over-year that we would expect. But outside of those things, we feel like we will be able to maintain relatively stable gross margins. 
Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick one on the Zoro gross margins because as you burn off B2C focus on B2B, I thought B2B gross margins would have been higher than B2C. So therefore, you actually get a gross margin mix up. So just wanted to understand that dynamic. 
D.G. Macpherson: In Zoro, that's not the way it works. It's basically one price and spot discounts in some cases. But we don't have differentiated pricing for business to consumers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. 
Stephen Volkmann : I wanted to go back to something you said, D.G. I think you said you didn't expect any cost increases or pressures in '24. I'm not sure exactly how you put that. But are we thinking that cost and price are sort of flat in '24? 
D.G. Macpherson: Well, we haven't really talked about that yet. But we do know that we're not seeing as much product cost pressure as we've seen in the last two years. And there are certain categories where costs will be down that are commodity related and certainly will be up. But generally, we're not seeing a lot of cost pressure. We'll talk about price cost and the actual numbers at the end of the year for next year. 
Stephen Volkmann : Okay. Fair enough. And in your long-term algo you talked about leveraging on SG&A, but we didn't actually do that this quarter. I guess we're making some investments. Do those continue for a number of quarters? Or how do we think about the sort of trajectory there? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean we're going to continue to invest in the business, but we do believe that we will have consistent over -- in any quarter, you may not see it, but over time, we will have SG&A leverage as we continue to find ways to improve our cost position for us to investing into this. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital Markets. 
Chris Dankert : I hate to keep harping on Zoro here, but I'm curious, again, you talked about a couple of different initiatives. But I mean, is there a friction in that system that we need to pull out? Or kind of what can you really get that customer acquisition up? Given SKU count has been moving up and doing well, what else kind of has to happen to the system perhaps on a more holistic basis? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, I would reiterate that I think on the customer acquisition piece, which the product breadth really does help, we've actually done quite well. And it's after that, where we're trying to get customers to become repeat customers where we've done well in some cases, but we need to improve that part of the model. And again, not to oversimplify that you use the product breadth to get new customers in, and then you have to become intimate with these customers in some way to get them to repeat buy, and that's really what we're focused on doing. 
Chris Dankert : Got it. And just as far as like benchmarking, given the greater cyclicality in that business, how should we be thinking about growth there beyond just this year and some of the challenges we've seen? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean we still think that it's going to be a real strong growth driver for the company. We're going to -- like I said, we're running some tests here in the fourth quarter. We're going to learn more, and we'll continue to communicate with you what we think the go-forward growth is as we move forward. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray : Question on destocking because it's -- I'm not sure it's an issue for you. Certainly not -- it's not coming up on the call here and in your remarks. Any issues with customer destocking, maybe they're lightening up on some of their working capitals, lead times on products and just all sort of the post-COVID normalization. Is that at all impacting your volumes? 
D.G. Macpherson: No. That really never comes up in customer visits. I was out in Northern California last week. And I would say for our types of products, customers just generally don't ever have like overstock of our inventory, they're buying when they need it. And frankly, a lot of our value proposition is helping them not have too much. So we really pride ourselves in making sure that customers have what they need to keep the business running, and that's really all they have. 
Deane Dray : Good. All right. That's -- I like hearing that. And then maybe I'm just more aware of it now, but is there a bigger push on brand building, both in advertising, TV and radio because I'm certainly hearing it a lot more. And how do you measure the returns on that I'm certainly -- it helps on brand building. It helps some of your outgrowth, but do you have any other precision around that? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Certainly, we've talked about it before, marketing has been a big part of what's helping us gain share. In terms of media advertising, we generally measure returns based on A/B tests where we test in certain markets and understand what the actual pull-through is from those. And so we -- I would say our marketing area is probably the -- as well in measured areas you could possibly imagine. So we can tell you with a lot of precision what's working and what's not, and that helps us figure out what to do. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. 
Chris Snyder : I wanted to ask on the project-related value-added services. I guess first, just to confirm, it sounds like that was a 60 basis point boost to high such gross margin in Q3? And then I guess kind of just higher level, can you just talk a little bit about what are these project-related value-added services that the company is providing? And what makes them 1 time or transitory in nature? 
Dee Merriwether: So thanks for the questions. So -- we go to market with our customers to help them solve problems, and those problems are solved with a combination of products, as you know, but also services. We have over 400 what we classify as value-added service providers that help us solve those customers' problems. And this is an ongoing revenue stream for us. However, what we have attempted to call out in this quarter and then also it impacted us in Q2 is that we had a larger number of projects in the services area that we do not believe will repeat. Some of those projects include things that are more steady state for us that we have been working with our customers on over the longer period of time are things like lighting retrofits, roofing projects, safety certifications to help them ensure that they are investing in the right products as well as capabilities to ensure that they can pass safety audits, et cetera. 
Chris Snyder : And then was that right? Or did you say earlier, it was a 60 basis point boost in Q3 to the High-Touch gross margin? 
Dee Merriwether: Yes, that is correct. 
Chris Snyder : Okay. Thank you. And then maybe staying on the topic of services. D.G., in your opening remarks, you talked a lot about the value-added services that Grainger is bringing to the table. I guess as we think about those going forward, do you view those services as a way for you guys to continue to drive price even in a cost environment or purchase environment as called out going sideways? Or do you view those more as just -- well, that's why we can outgrow the market by mid-single digits on a volume basis? 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So I'd probably frame that a little bit differently. So we are first and foremost a product company. We did two things for almost every customer. We help them simplify their purchasing process. We try to make it really easy for them to buy, receive, pay, return if they need to, the products we have, and then we help customers manage inventory. And so for almost all customers that are of any size, we're doing those two things, and those are not actually in the realm of what you would call value-added services, I should just described.  Then there are a whole bunch of value-added things that we provide to our customers often through our supplier partnerships that are service related. They are a minority of our business, but they are important when customers want them. So if the customer wants to do safety audit. It's really important that we can help them understand what challenges they have and help them get better at safety and so we provide that service to our partners. And we will continue to do those things. But generally, I think the thing that's different this quarter is there was, in particular, a couple of very large projects that probably are not likely to repeat, that were driven by things that typically don't happen and so we just wanted to call those out. But our fundamental business model and how we add value to customers is really around helping them get the products they need to keep their operations running, make sure they have the right inventory. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. 
Patrick Baumann : A lot of numbers like flying around on the gross margin side. So I just want to clarify, the 40 basis points, Dee, that you mentioned of gross margin, on an annual basis? 
Dee Merriwether: Yes. When I was calling out... 
Patrick Baumann : Is it '23? 
Dee Merriwether: Yes, that is if you are looking to normalize '23 and are thinking about gross margins on a go-forward basis, that's the 40 basis points. 
Patrick Baumann : Right. Right. So all else equal, that's -- so if everything else is 40 basis points comes out of your '23 number as kind of like a baseline? 
Dee Merriwether: Correct. 
Patrick Baumann : And that's for next year. Okay. And then the follow-up is it sounds like maybe 2024 is a more normal year for pricing based on your comments that there is a lot of product cost pressure. Assuming that's the case, and with the gross margin coming down a bit. Do you see SG&A inflation slowing off to be able to deliver a bottom line margin expansion? It looks like your fourth quarter guide there was flat year-over-year, but I think maybe there was some onetime benefit in SG&A last year that were onetime cost, I think, in SG&A last year that inflated the prior year results. Just curious if you could give any color on that. 
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So I think when you look at our results quarter-over-quarter, there are some timing things that happen. We continue to invest in demand generation to help us ensure that we can drive specifically in the U.S. long-term market outgrowth. When you look at prior year quarter, we had a number of things happen. I think you recall, in Q4, we had a LIFO benefit last year that we will all be cycling. But just zooming out a little bit, if you go back to our framework, over time, we want to outgrow the market in the U.S. by 400 to 500 basis points.  D.G. talked a little bit about the fact that we are -- while we are looking to invest in long-term growth, we also look to gain leverage. And if you really looked into how we're doing that, most of our SG&A investments are really targeted towards high-return demand-generating investments. And a lot of the SG&A productivity are leverage. We are gaining in our noncore SG&A expenses and we accomplished that through really continuous improvement. So we're really targeting things that help us with achieving an improved customer experience, but also assist us with operating more efficiently and effectively. Our intent is to continue to invest in demand gen but also look to offset as much of that as we can -- reasonably can do through continuous improvement activities. If you look at that algorithm that we laid out for Investor Day, it talks about driving double-digit EPS growth over the cycle. And so we still expect to do that. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks. 
D.G. Macpherson: All right. Thanks, everyone. We recognize that today is a very busy day for all of you in terms of the number of people that are releasing results, and I appreciate you spending time with us.  Yes, I would just reiterate that we feel really good about the way the year has played out. It's played out pretty similar to what we expected. We continue to invest in the business to drive profitable share gain. That is our primary focus, and we continue to invest not only that, but in our team and in making sure that our customers are successful. So appreciate you joining us. I hope you have a great day. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All participants may disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger’s second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of the various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q2 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning’s call will focus on our second quarter 2023 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for all periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO’s public statements. Now, I will turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I’ll provide an overview of our second quarter performance and then pass it to Dee to walk through the financials in detail. As we work our way through 2023, Grainger continues to stay focused on what matters most: providing our customers with the products and services they need through exceptional service. Everything we do is grounded in our Grainger Edge framework, which I’d like to highlight today in the context of our recently released ESG report. I would encourage you all to check out the full report at graingeresg.com. Grainger has long been a leader in ESG, both for our customers and in our own operations. Internally, we have laid out four near-term ESG focus areas that are important parts of both our culture and operations. Early indications show that we are making meaningful progress. I will start with our customer sustainability solutions. In 2022, revenue in High-Touch U.S. business for our environmentally preferred products was more than $1 billion and has increased steadily over the last few years. Customer conversations around their environmental footprint have become commonplace and we are well positioned to help customers in this space. On the right side, you will see how we are helping our customers achieve their goals by tying sustainability to our product and service offerings. We recently worked with a large container terminal operator that was in search of an opportunity to offset fossil fuel-based energy use, enhance its group resilience and reduce cost. Through our sustainability services offering, the customer purchased and will install more than 300 solar panels. These panels will help them avoid approximately 4,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the next 20 years, the equivalent of 9 million miles driven by a car. This is just one example, but we partner with our customers like this everyday, connecting them to our network of service provider partners and helping ensure we can be the go-to partner for everything they need to run safe, reliable and sustainable operations. Second, supplier diversity. Grainger plays an important role in champion businesses owned by underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, LGBTQ+ and people with disabilities through this program. Last year, we spent more than $2 billion on products from our diverse supplier base and continue to make further progress as we expand partnerships in this space. Third, energy and emissions. Since 2018, we have reduced our global absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 26%, nearing our 2030 goal of a 30% reduction. And finally, diversity, equity and inclusion. DEI is a continuous journey. We are proud to have been named one of Fortune’s Best Places to Work for Women in addition to being recognized by other organizations for our work to celebrate and support all team members no matter their ethnicity, orientation, age, disability or veteran status. Each of these near-term priorities are an important part of our ESG focus and are helping us to scale our actions to make a greater impact for both Grainger and our customers. Our team will continue to follow the Grainger Edge as we make progress toward our own near-term initiatives and partner with our customers as they work to achieve their ESG goals, together positively impacting the communities where we operate. Now to review highlights for the quarter. As you can see, we again delivered a strong quarter of performance as we continue to show up well in supporting our customers. As expected, year-over-year growth rates are decelerating, but demand remains reasonably steady. For the quarter, we finished with daily sales growth of 9% or 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by positive performance in both segments, most notably within the High-Touch Solutions segment, which outpaced the broader MRO market by approximately 525 basis points in the U.S. Total company operating margin was 15.8%, an increase of 190 basis points over the prior year as improved gross margin performance was driven primarily by continued supply chain efficiencies and lower freight and container costs. Combine this with our strong top line growth and we delivered substantial EPS growth, robust operating cash flow and continued ROIC of over 40%. We also returned a combined $265 million to Grainger shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Alongside these great results, we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives. In the High-Touch model, we are advancing our proprietary product and customer information management systems that fuel our growth engines and allow us to advance marketing, merchandising and seller investments in the U.S. The Endless Assortment business is seeing some macro-related demand softening in the U.S. But overall, the team continues to focus on providing reliable service while increasing repeat purchase rates with core B2B customers at Zoro and growing with enterprise customers at MonotaRO. Lastly, a few weeks ago, we announced our plans to construct a new 500,000 square foot distribution center outside of Portland, Oregon, which will support our customers across the Pacific Northwest and is expected to open in 2025. In addition, we are implementing three smaller bulk-style distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Texas and North Carolina, which are each slated to open over the next few quarters. These investments enable us to keep up with strong customer demand and allow us to extend our industry leading service capabilities, which deliver a best-in-class experience focused on next-day complete fulfillment across the United States. As we remain focused on what matters, I am pleased with the progress we have made through the first half of 2023. With our strong execution and as market demand remains reasonably steady, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2023 revenue and EPS guidance. I will now pass it over to Dee to go through the details.
Dee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. Starting with Slide 8 you can see the high-level results for the total company, including strong daily sales growth of 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis. Although year-over-year growth rates decelerated compared to Q1 as inflation cools and as we lap a tougher prior year comparison, daily sales dollars remained strong and we are on track to deliver a great year. Total company operating margin was up 190 basis points as expanded gross margins in both segments were further aided by SG&A leverage in the High-Touch Solutions North American segment. In total, we delivered diluted EPS in the quarter of $9.28, which was up 29% versus the second quarter of 2022. Diving into segment level details, for the second quarter, we continued to see strong results within our High-Touch segment, with daily sales up 9.9%, fueled by revenue growth in all geographies. Although year-over-year growth rates have slowed as we lap prior year price inflation, volume growth remains healthy and was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. In the U.S., we continue to see positive growth in nearly all customer end segments. However, this does include pockets of softness, including decelerating growth in manufacturing and commercial services. However, given our diversified customer base, this is countered by strong growth in other areas such as government and healthcare. In Canada, the economy remains stable and we are seeing strong results with Canadian daily sales up about 7% in local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, up 200 basis points versus the prior year. Product availability levels remained high, resulting in fewer packages and shorter distance shipments in the current year as service returned to near pre-pandemic levels. This one coupled with lower fuel and container rates is driving significant fuel and supply chain tailwinds in the quarter. Product mix was also favorable primarily due to improved product availability and a higher mix of margin-accretive products and services. Price/cost spread was slightly negative after adjusting for non-recurring – a non-recurring 40 basis point supplier rebate benefit recognized in the quarter. As expected, the favorability captured in 2022 began to unwind in the second quarter and we expect this to continue for the remainder of the year as we turn towards our long-term neutrality target. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year as the GP favorability fell to the bottom and revenue growth more than offset continued demand generation investments in headcount and marketing. Overall, this was another strong quarter for the High-Touch North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 4.5% and 5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 525 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter. Although this is a sequential slowdown from Q1, we comped a very strong prior year quarter and performance remains above our annual target to outgrow the market by 400 to 500 basis points through economic cycles. We are well on our way towards achieving that target again in 2023. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, sales increased 4.5% or 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 2.8%, while MonotaRO achieved 12.6% growth in local days, local currency. At a business level, MonotaRO continues to execute well and is driving solid year-over-year revenue growth as they increase registered users and grow the enterprise customers. At Zoro, while slower growth partially reflects a tougher prior year comparison, we are seeing slowing demand across their customer base. Similar to Q1, non-core B2C business remained a headwind in the quarter and was down in the mid-teens year-over-year. Further, we have seen a slowdown in Zoro’s core B2B business, which makes up a majority of Zoro’s revenue. While we are still growing in the high single-digits with these core customers, macro-related factors are impacting demand given Zoro’s end market mix as well as their tilt to smaller sized businesses, which seem to be struggling more in this environment. We expect both of these headwinds to persist for the remainder of the year. Stepping back, Zoro has delivered great results over the last 2 years as we have added SKUs to our assortment, increased registered users and served both core and non-core customers well during the pandemic. As we plan for our next leg of growth, the new local leadership team is focusing their efforts to drive repeat profitable growth with core B2B customers. This should help propel our results through the cycle as we continue to provide a one-stop endless aisle with easy-to-find products and a no-hassle delivery experience for smaller, less complex businesses in the U.S. From a profitability perspective, gross margin for the segment expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year due to continued freight efficiencies and strong price realization at MonotaRO, which offset unfavorable product mix at Zoro. Operating margins declined slightly year-over-year to 8.6% as gross margin favorability was offset by continued investments in marketing and slower-than-expected top line growth at Zoro. On Slide 12, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. On the left-hand side, in line with prior quarter growth, total registered users grew nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined up 16% over the prior year. On the right, we also continue to see growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio, which grew by 200,000 SKUs in the second quarter and stands at over 12.2 million in total. Now looking forward to the rest of the year. Given our strong share gain to date and the continued supportive demand environment, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2023 outlook by increasing the lower end of our revenue and earnings ranges. Our revised outlook includes daily sales growth of 8.5% to 11% for total company, which is roughly a 75 basis point increase at the midpoint compared to the prior range. High-Touch growth continues to trend slightly higher than expected as we continue to gain share amidst a reasonably steady demand environment. The strength in High-Touch is offsetting lower-than-expected top line performance with Endless Assortment primarily due to the softness at Zoro as previously mentioned. Altogether, at the total company level, we are confident in our ability to drive growth in the second half and achieve our updated estimates. Looking specifically at July, we’ve started the third quarter strong and reported month-to-date sales up over 8%, which is roughly 50 basis points higher on a daily constant currency basis. From a margin perspective, both gross profit margin and operating margin rate expectations remain unchanged from our previous update. From a seasonality perspective, we expect Q3 margin rates to decline sequentially quarter-over-quarter as the one-time supplier rebate we captured this quarter falls off and as price/cost favorability continues to unwind. Couple this with the continued rapid demand generation investments, and we expect total company operating margins to be lower in the back half of the year. However, we’re still on track to finish 2023 with full year operating margins at an all-time high. All in, the resulting revised EPS range has been raised and stands between $35 and $36.75. Supplemental guidance covering cash flow and share repurchase, which have also been raised, can be found in the appendix of the deck. In summary, I look forward to the remainder of 2023 feeling confident in our team’s ability to continue to serve our customers well, achieve profitable growth and drive strong results for our shareholders. With that, I’ll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. I am very proud of the way our team continues to show up and support our customers. Our capabilities and deep understanding of our customers’ operation positions us well in the back half of the year and into the future. When we stay focused on the things that matter, helping our customers find the right products and solutions, providing exceptional service and investing in our supply chain and digital capabilities, we will continue to grow and gain share through any cycle. With that, we will open the line up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.
Tommy Moll: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Tommy Moll: Dee, I appreciate the insight you gave on Zoro’s top line trends through the quarter on the B2C versus the B2B side. And you highlighted that even on the B2B side, there was some weakening though it was still up, I think you said high singles in the quarter. So my question is, is there anything more you can tell us about that B2B deceleration in terms of end market or customer type or anything else you could provide there would be helpful? Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, Tommy, I’ll take that. Yes. So if you think about the vertical industry mix that Zoro serves, some of the fastest-growing segments in the Grainger model, the High-Touch model would be government healthcare, some manufacturing like aerospace, Zoro does not participate in those really at all. And then the other trend we’re seeing is Zoro is sort of small businesses a lot more than Grainger does. And those customers appear to be a little softer than the larger customers that we serve. So those two factors have a significant impact. Zoro did increase the repeat rate in the quarter, but they have some work to do to continue to increase the repeat rate. So we’re working hard to do that. But the segment mix is a pretty big impact on Zoro right now.
Tommy Moll: Thank you. That’s helpful, D.G. And then I also wanted to ask about the distribution center you announced for Oregon. I guess it’s a two-part question. One, just anything you can give us in terms of timeline to break ground, cut the ribbon, when most of the CapEx hits. And then second part, just a higher-level question. Should we view this as any shift in a competitive strategy or emphasis in that part of the country or it’s more you just outgrew the existing roof line you had and needed to expand? Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we break ground in a couple of weeks, and like we said, 2025 is when the building will be fully up. And so that’s the time frame on it. What I would say is that we have been serving the Northwest out of our branches and out of a very small distribution center in Seattle, and we have outgrown that pretty substantially. And we’ve also been serving out of Patterson, California. So putting the building up in the Northwest allows us to have more SKUs in market, better service. It also allows us to lower transportation costs because we have much shorter routes from that building to our customers in Seattle, Portland throughout the Northwest. So it’s basically just a normal course of action where we evaluate our footprint and continue to expand where it makes sense.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.
Ryan Merkel: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. A couple of questions on gross margin. So how should we think about gross margins in the second half? Is it around 39? Is that the right metric? And then does it dip a little bit in 3Q and then increase sequentially a little bit in 4Q?
Dee Merriwether: So thanks for the question. I think if you kind of focus on the guide and then kind of look at what that implies for us, we’re expecting GP to decline slightly mostly due to the High-Touch impact and what we have been stating pretty much all year that we started at the beginning of the year related to the unwind of price/cost. If you recall, last year, we took price as we continue to say price and cost continue to be somewhat lumpy. We can’t time those things exactly right. And so we’re going to see higher costs sequentially as we go through the year and a little slightly lower price. So we expect GP to decline a bit in the second half.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That’s helpful. And then just a higher-level question on gross margin. I think the guidance you put out there for ‘25 was High-Touch gross margin about 40%. We’re a good bit above that here in ‘23. Are you planning on updating that outlook anytime soon? Or how should we think about any new thoughts you might have there?
Dee Merriwether: So you’re exactly right. And what I would say is we’ve done really well through this period of cost inflation and our ability to price to the market and price well. As I stated last quarter, things still remain fluid. And while we’re gaining some supply chain efficiencies as we would expect as well as diesel fuel and things like that coming down from some highs, I’m still looking to have a couple more quarters here. And we will definitely take a look at our outlook here in the future and provide an update.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. Also on the sustainability of gross margin, in High-Touch, you cited freight and supply chain and mix, and then there are various factors on the Endless Assortment as well. Are these factors – are those – any of those really prone to reversion? Or should we expect gross margin at least within a band to be reasonably sustainable until we get that shift between High-Touch and Endless Assortment back? It seems like that trend is going counter to what the usual trend would have been, which would be EA to outgrow High-Touch. Can you talk about that a bit?
Dee Merriwether: Yes, I do think that’s the right way to look – to think about it. So we are getting some tailwinds that we have this year specifically related to supply chain and freight efficiencies, which are somewhat significant. And those can flip on us at any time. But right now, we feel like we’re in line with where diesel fuel is as well as we’ve gotten some benefits from those friction costs that we talked about, D.G. just mentioned this, talking about transportation costs and extra legs of transportation that we had over the prior years. We’re fairly normalized in those areas, getting close to pre-pandemic levels as it relates to that. We did have in the quarter some one-time favorability, about 40 basis points related to that one-time rebate. And we are seeing as we kind of talked about price/cost in the quarter turned slightly negative, which we expect to continue. So, those are some of the puts and takes as it relates, but again, our target 40-ish 2025, we are not changing at this point in time. But I do feel very good about the stability of High-Touch margins in that range.
D.G. Macpherson: The other thing I would add to that, Dave, is that the transportation cost can fluctuate. The supply chain efficiencies, we are for all intents and purposes at this point back to where we were before the pandemic. Those should stay right. Those won’t reverse. That was all pandemic-driven in terms of all the efficiencies we had in the system. So, that should stay. Should that – those pieces of it should stay stable.
David Manthey: Okay. Thank you. And then you mentioned price as a driver for High-Touch, but then you have been saying you are in this negative price/cost position. Dee, you had mentioned that it’s a little tricky to line things up exactly from a timing standpoint. What opportunities do you have to take actions over the next six months, say, to reestablish price/cost neutrality if you plan to do that at all?
Dee Merriwether: Well, again, the U.S. team works really hard to remain price competitive. That’s our other tenet that gets us to price/cost neutrality and are always looking for opportunities to the price and optimize price with our customers over time. So, I would say that’s the biggest opportunity we have related to price in the future is ensuring that we are optimizing and each of our customer segments have the appropriate price for the goods and services that we are providing them. But remaining price/cost competitive is the key tenet here that really buoys our growth – our volume growth over the cycle.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your question.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I also wanted to ask on price/cost. And in the prepared remarks you said that price/cost was negative in the quarter and at least on a year-on-year basis. But then you also said that price/cost favorability will unwind in the back half of the year, if I heard that right. So, they kind of sound conflicting a little bit. I don’t know if it’s a year-on-year or sequential thing. But could you just maybe help me think through that? Thank you.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So, price/cost in this quarter when you adjust for the one-time supplier rebate was slightly negative. And as we started the year, we provided an outlook that as the year continues to flow that we would become price/cost negative because we had favorable price last year. And costs did not come in as we had expected because we had the opportunity to continue to work with our supply base on the cost inflation, which is now coming this year. So, that is why price/cost will become more negative as we go into the second half of this year.
Chris Snyder: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. And then I guess maybe just kind of following up on the gross margin topic. I mean is there any way to think about that level of price/cost unwind into the back half of the year? And then also on the 40 basis points supplier rebate, any just more color on that? Usually that’s something that we think of coming into the fourth quarter. Thank you.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So, I wouldn’t over-pivot on the one-time adjustment. It was related to the prior period. It’s not something that we would expect to continue. And I would say the other thing I would add, if you look at our price/cost over a longer period, maybe a 2-year period, we do not expect it to be negative. That’s how we end up hitting our target of price/cost neutrality over time. So, I would not read into that some of the impacts that we are going to have in the second half of this year are expected to continue any longer than that period.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on Endless Assortment. Curious how you considered the thought that perhaps the fundamental kind of algorithm for 16% to 18% growth to ‘25 temporary lull or maybe more practical to reconsider long-term, perhaps high-single digits, low-double digits. I know Zoro is rationalizing some of the customer mix, and MonotaRO has some different strategies around customer demographics that have been a bit in flux as well. So, curious how – what might be a practical update on that metric.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So, I appreciate the question, Chris. I think similar to sort of gross margin outlook, we want to see probably a few more quarters of performance to understand how this plays out. The MonotaRO business in Japan has continued to perform pretty well and not obvious that they are going to be in a different place they have historically going forward at this point. And we do think that some of the Zoro’s issues are fairly temporary as they unwind some consumer business and some other B2B business that – changes that are going on. So, not really ready to talk about sort of changing the outlook in the future, but certainly, we will consider that as the year goes on.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Great. And then I was just curious on the SG&A spend rate in the second quarter, is that a kind of good benchmark to think about stability in that kind of dollar rate range for the second half?
Dee Merriwether: Yes, I think that’s a good thing to consider.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. Please state your question.
Jacob Levinson: Good morning D.G. and Dee.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Dee Merriwether: Good morning.
Jacob Levinson: If you will humor one more price-related question and then we can move on just high level, trying to get a sense of whether your suppliers are talking about or have already put through midyear price increases or if they are talking about further price increases in the latter half of the year or whether with inflation coming down, we are really just past that cycle, if you will?
Dee Merriwether: We are working with our supplier base and get back to some of our normal inflation cadence that was not so normal during the pandemic. So, as it relates to this year, I think we have a good handle on what we believe our cost inflation will be, and we have embedded that in our guide. And of course, later in the year, we will start working with them on what 2024 looks like.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. And we talked about this at the beginning of the year, Jake. I think that almost all of the inflation we are going to see this year is wrapped from last year. And so we are seeing puts and takes, ups and downs with suppliers. But in general, there is just not a lot of additional inflation coming in from our suppliers.
Jacob Levinson: Okay. That makes sense. Just switching gears to inventories for a second. I know your inventory is lose in dollar terms seem to have stabilized here. I am sure that there is some inflation math in there, but how are you thinking about stocking levels going forward, or maybe said differently, is there a new normal post the sort of supply chain disruptions and COVID issues that we have seen in the last couple of years that’s maybe higher than it was back in 2019 or so?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean – so what I would say is we generally have two premises when we think about inventory levels. The first one is to stock see service levels. So, based on the velocity of items, we have set targets for the service we want to provide on those items that is competitively advantaged. And we basically stock to that. The other is we look at wasteful inventory, inventory that isn’t productive and make sure to manage that down. I don’t think we are necessarily in a new world. We still have some elongated supplier lead times now. Those have mostly come down. And as those continue to come down, I suspect we can be mostly back to where we were historically from an inventory perspective to revenue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Patrick Baumann: Hi. Good morning. Just I got one more on price. Sorry about that. The – is there an update to how you think you are going to finish the year on price at High-Touch? And just curious if you are seeing any changes in like demand you will have to see with respect to – I think you make changes with your web pricing ahead of like making changes in the CRP. Just curious if you’re seeing any changes to velocity [ph] related to moves you are making there? And then on Zoro within the price discussion, has that been holding up as well as it has in the High-Touch segment?
Dee Merriwether: So, I will start. We have made some pricing changes earlier in the year. We don’t see in the U.S. the need to make any significant pricing adjustments for the balance of the year, but the pricing team is always in the market looking at price and making sure that we are competitively priced. The Zoro business, I would say, from a gross margin perspective operates a little bit differently and are targeting a different customer segment as D.G. alluded to. And they also have their own pricing algorithm and pricing team that is focused on remaining competitive with the customers that they are serving and have taken actions to price their products in line with the inflation that that’s been passed on to them.
Patrick Baumann: And then the price for the year there at High-Touch, prices at High-Touch for the year, do you have an update on that? That was part of the question.
Dee Merriwether: Alright. I understand. So, it still remains around 4% to 5%. That hasn’t changed.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. And my follow-up is on inventory again. I guess I am just curious what drove the better-than-expected cash guide, the upgrade to the guidance? Was it you are planning to hold a little bit less inventory than you previously planned, or is there something else?
Dee Merriwether: No. Really, the operating cash outlook is really due to the top line improvement at High-Touch that’s really flowed through. And as a result of that, we took the opportunity to update the operating cash flow guide about $75 million at the midpoint.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. And Dray, your line is open. Please un-mute yourself.
D.G. Macpherson: We think it’s probably Deane Dray since we know…
Operator: Sorry Deane Dray. Your line is open, please go ahead, RBC Capital Markets. Here we will move on. And that’s the final question for today. So, I will now turn the floor over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Alright. Thanks for joining the call today. What I would say is the year is playing out pretty much as we expected. We talked a lot about price/cost. It’s actually played out almost exactly like we expected at the beginning of the year. So, there are really no surprises generally in the market at this point. We continue to feel good about our performance, our share gain, our profitability and feel like we are well positioned to have a really strong second half relative to the market. And so we are going to continue to work on that. And I just appreciate you being on the call, and we look forward to seeing you and talking to you down the line. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 11:40:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Kyle Bland, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Kyle.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q1 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on our first quarter 2023 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for all periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and filed Japanese gap which differs from US GAAP and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter performance and then pass it to Deidra to walk through the financials in detail. Grainger started 2023 focused on what matters most. Providing our customers with the products and services they need through exceptional service. We remain closely embedded with our customers, finding ways to help them manage their inventory, reduce costs, achieve their ESG objectives and successfully run their operations. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit with several customers in the manufacturing space in one of my favorite Midwest cities. I heard very clearly how well our teams have served them in the last few years, giving us great opportunity to grow with these customers in the future. We win when we serve our customers exceptionally well and my interactions with our teams and customers this quarter have been a great example of how we are winning each day. Many customers, especially those in the industrial space, continue to see solid end market demand for their products. However, we do see some customers with more consumer-facing exposure heading into a softer demand cycle. No matter what economic uncertainties our customers are facing, we remain committed to our overall focus of helping our customers keep their operations running and their people safe. This consistent approach and relentless focus on the customer rallies our team and fuels our results. As you can see, we again delivered a strong quarter of performance to start the year as demand remains resilient and as we continue to execute well. We are making progress on our strategic growth engines in our high-touch model as we further our merchandising efforts, continue to make smart marketing investments, expand our inventory management capabilities for customers and build out tools to better equip our sellers. The Enlist assortment business continues to execute their strategy as they add SKUs at Zoro, expand with enterprise customers at MonotaRO and at a healthy clip of new registered users each quarter. Our momentum is further supported by our world-class supply chain and distribution network, which benefited from an uptick in product availability as supplier lead times improved. This resulted in a sharp improvement in our service metrics to near pre-pandemic levels, faster than we had anticipated at the start of the year. With this swift improvement, we were able to meaningfully decrease frictional costs within the network by reducing average shipping distance and minimizing handling costs. All while delivering a higher percentage of orders complete and next day. This improvement is a reminder of just how much unusual and extraordinary activity we did to get products to customers through the pandemic and subsequent availability challenges. The return to more normal supply chain performance is great news for our customers and our supply chain team. The progress made across all these fronts helped drive great financial results for the first quarter, where we finished with sales growth of 12.2% and or 14.5% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by solid performance in both segments, most notably within the High Touch Solutions segment, which outpaced the broader MRO market by approximately 750 basis points in the US. Total company operating margins were 16.6%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year period on improved gross margin performance due primarily to the supply chain efficiencies just discussed. Combined with our strong top line growth, we delivered EPS of $9.61 per share and a strong ROIC of 45.6%. During the quarter, we produced record operating cash flow of $454 million with free cash flow of $356 million, and we returned a combined $229 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And yesterday, we were pleased to announce a $1.86 quarterly dividend, which represents an 8% increase. This marks our 52nd year of consecutive dividend increases, a track record that we are proud of. Finally, based on the strong start to the year and continued support of trends at April, we are raising our full year 2023 guidance, which Steve will outline in just a bit. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter.
Dee Merriwether: Thanks, DG. I'd like to echo DG's sentiment – execution on our growth strategy and improved service from a return to more normal supply chain performance helped drive excellent results in the quarter. Starting on slide 7, you can see the high-level results, including strong sales growth of 14. 5% in daily constant currency, driven by double-digit growth locally in both segments. Although year-over-year growth rates decelerated as we moved through the quarter on tougher comps, daily sales dollars remained strong and were reasonably in line with historical sequential growth trend. Total company operating margin was up 200 basis points as expanded gross margins in both segments dropped to the bottom line. SG&A margin was flat year-over-year as investments in headcount, marketing and technology were offset by revenue growth. In total, we delivered diluted EPS in the quarter of $9.61 up 36% versus the first quarter of 2022. Diving into segment level details. For the first quarter, we continued to see strong results within our Hi-tech segment with daily sales of 14.5%, fueled by revenue growth in all geographies. Customer demand was generally in line with expectations for the quarter and continues to remain resilient as a whole despite certain areas of softness. In the US, we are seeing broad-based strength across most of the manufacturing with contractors and government customers to name a few. Retail and warehousing are slowing the most, but still up high single digits. In Canada, the economy remains stable, and we are seeing good results across most end markets with Canadian daily sales up 11% and local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 42.4%, up 195 basis points versus the prior year. This expansion was largely driven by freight and supply chain efficiencies as well as product mix favorability. As DG mentioned, improved product availability and short of supplier lead times drove improved stocking positions in our DCs. This availability improvement resulted in more efficient shipping routes, which helped reduce freight expense and lower our handling costs. Freight expense was further aided by a onetime adjustment, which drove 20 basis points of improvement in the period. Product mix was also a tailwind and partially due to improved product availability and partially from lapping the pandemic fuel spike in safety sales from last year's Omicron variant. For the quarter, price cost per ad was neutral and trended largely as anticipated as price/cost favorability we captured in 2022 began to unwind and offset the structural timing benefit we typically see as we passed price early in the first quarter each year. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 215 basis points year-over-year. The strong gross margin in the quarter was fully aided by 20 basis points of SG&A leverage as marketing and headcount investments were more than offset by revenue growth. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the High-Tech Solutions North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the US MRO market grew between 7% and 8%, indicating that we achieved roughly 750 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter. As we continue to build strong partnerships and make progress with our growth engines, our customers continue to turn to Grainger to help them solve their MRO challenges. Coupled this with our supply chain service advantage, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in delivering against our goal to consistently outgrow the US MRO market by 400 to 500 basis points in any economic cycle. Moving to the endless assortment segment. Sales increased 3.8% or 14% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese hand. So US was up 13.5%, while MonotaRO achieved 12% growth in local stains and local currency. While Zoro generated solid growth, they are off to a slower start than anticipated predominantly due to noncore B2C business, which was down in the mid-teens year-over-year. For small B2B customers who make up a majority of the world's business were up nicely in the first quarter but are softening a bit in April give Zoro more diversified end market customer mix outside of the industrial economy. At MonotaRO, sales were impacted by adverse weather as well as slower return to work patterns with the New Year holiday following midweek. Sales have ramped back over the last several weeks, and we expect results to be more in line with our expectations for the balance of the year. From a profitability perspective, gross margin for this segment expanded 140 basis points versus the prior year due to strong price realization and continued freight efficiencies across both businesses as well as favorable business unit mix for the segment. Operating margins expanded by 15 basis points year-over-year to 8.1% and primarily due to gross margin favorability offsetting investments in marketing and headcount to drive customer acquisition and assortment expansion. On slide 11, we continue to see positive results with our key endless assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined up 16% over the prior year. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro SKU portfolio, which grew by 900,000 SKUs in Q1 and stands at around $12 million in total. We are well on our way to achieving an annual goal of 2 million SKU additions in 2023. Now looking forward to the rest of the year, given the unexpected sharp improvement in profitability and continued resilient demand environment, we are updating our total company guidance for 2023. In our revised outlook, we are holding top line expectations with daily sales expected to be up 7% to 11% for the total company. This reflects solid Q1 performance in high touch offsetting a slightly slower start across inlets assortment with expected softness to continue for the balance of the year at Zoro. High Touch is trending slightly higher than originally expected on a similar 1% to 5% total US MRO market outlook, which continued strong share gains. And this assortment is trending slightly lower, however, we expect daily sales for this segment to be up low double digits, which is a couple of hundred basis points higher when translated to constant currency. Note that April sales growth for the total company is holding firm with month-to-date sales up 10% year-over-year or nearly 11% in daily constant currency. The larger changes to our guide come on the profitability side. More improved product availability and the resulting step change in service levels is driving better freight dynamics, lower handling costs and improved product mix. With this, we are raising our gross margin range to 39.1% in to 39.4%, up 70 to 100 basis points year-over-year. While we still expect to be price/cost negative over the next few quarters as we unwind prior year favorability. The supply chain improvement is flowing through our P&L much faster than anticipated and is fueling the predominance of our revised outlook. The increase in gross margin largely falls through the op margin improvement and resulting EPS, which we now expect to be between $34.25 and $36.75 and nearly 20% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We have updated our supplemental guidance, which can be found in the appendix and includes revised segment margins and improved operating cash flow outlook and increased expectations for share repurchases for the year. Our execution has put us on a great path. We are serving customers well -- we're remaining focused on the things that matter and are positioned to continue to take share. I exit the quarter very confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our commitment to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to DG for some closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Deid. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. Granger was recently named to the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work -- for list for the second year in a row. As you know, this is an exclusive recognition, one that honors companies with the best cultures, workplaces and people. Along with this list, we have also been named to the best places to work for women and the world's most admired companies, among others. We view this recognition as an output of the work we do to create a welcoming culture and a highly motivated team. I remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, deliver flawless experience and drive profitable growth over the long haul. And with that, we'll open the floor for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We are now conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Snyder from UBS.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask on outgrowth in the high-touch North America business. It just continues to hold firm between 700 and 800 basis points despite improving product availability, I would imagine, among some of your smaller competitors. Can you just maybe talk about why you think that isn't compressing despite pretty broad indications that supply chains are recovering?
D.G. Macpherson: Sure. Thanks, Chris. Yes. We are certainly seeing supply chains improve. I do think that a lot of the work we've done through the pandemic in the last three years has helped build some stickiness with our customers. I was -- every customer I go into, we've expanded our KeepStock operation if there of any size. We're filling bins, we're doing more and supporting customers to make sure that they have the right inventory in the right place. And I think that's been a big part of it. We continue to see really good results from merchandising, from marketing, from KeepStock and from our supply chain performance. All those things continue to be an advantage for us and helping us gain share.
Chris Snyder: Thanks. I appreciate that. And then on price cost, I think you mentioned that the guidance assumes price cost negative in the next few quarters on some of the give-back after running a bit ahead. Can you just maybe talk about the level of producer price increases that were kind of pushed through on you guys in February. And then just in general, any response from customers or any pushback on pricing? Thank you.
Dee Merriwether: So yeah, Chris. How you doing? I would talk about the -- the last part of your question, I believe, first, which was you asked about producer price push. That has, of course, become less and less over a period of time. So it's basically modest as what we have seen of late. However, as you know, in the first quarter is when we implemented some of those costs are pulled them through to our system. And so for Q1, it's traditionally a high watermark for us for price cost. And as you noted, we expect to unwind some of our price cost positivity from 2022 as a result through the next couple of quarters.
D.G. Macpherson: And in terms of customer response, what I would say, Chris, is that all of our -- effectively all of our share gain in the last three years has been on volume and not price. So we are priced competitively. And so we are not seeing unusual reactions from customers because we've maintained that competitiveness in our prices.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Your line is now live.
Tommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Tommy Moll: I wanted to stick on the theme of price cost to start here. You articulated several of the drivers for the gross margin performance, high-touch specifically is what I'm talking about here in the first quarter and have clarified the price/cost dynamic as we go through the year. Is it still safe to assume though that for the full year, you could land above that 40% long-term target even if we trend toward it as the year progresses?
Dee Merriwether: So thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had a really strong start to the year. And as I noted, we really feel like from a GP specifically in high touch, we're at a high watermark based upon the unwind that we're going to experience with price costs. A lot of the favorability that we experienced this quarter relates to our availability improving and some of the friction costs coming out faster and probably a little bit more pronounced then we would expect that is driving our results up. We did have a, I would say, a non-comparable freight impact of about 20 bps as you look at the outlook for the rest of the year. But other than that, we feel pretty confident in staying at this level based upon what we see right now.
Tommy Moll: Thank you. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about some of the weakness you identified for Zoro. It sounds like there were some non-core areas where you saw weakness but potentially also just as you rolled everything up to the full year outlook, there may have been other unfavorable factors there, at least versus your original outlook, but anything you could do to unpack what you're seeing there would be helpful. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah. So roughly 80% of Zoro's business is business to business customers that are small businesses and midsized businesses those, while they continue to perform pretty well in the first quarter. We are seeing sort of across everything smaller businesses and consumer-facing businesses slow down relative to certainly large and industrial-type businesses. So there's a mix here thing that's going on. And then the 20% that is not business to business, some of that came through the pandemic, as you might imagine. That has been down fairly substantially in the first quarter. So that's been a drag. Net-net, we still expect the endless assortment to be low double-digit growth, and we expect the segment to perform well during the year, but we do expect our -- to be below what we expected at the begin of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Ryan Merkel: Hey, everyone. Nice quarter.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Ryan.
Ryan Merkel: I wanted to start on the freight and supply chain dynamic. Can you just talk about maybe take us from November, December to today? And just talk about how you got surprised by supply chain sort of normalizing? And what sort of happened? Did everyone start to have the lead times improve it at one time in the quarter?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah. I think there's several things that happen, Ryan. I mean if you went back to the fourth quarter of last year, we were really solid in terms of our own distributions at our performance and our own and outbound freight at that point. Inbound freight was getting better and supply lead times are starting to get better, but still fairly elongated. We've seen both supplier lead times domestically and cushion freight come in faster than we expected and recover faster than we expected. So therefore, we have received a whole bunch of products into the system. And I mean it's probably obvious when you think about it. But if you went back a year ago, there were a lot of back-ordered items. And so if a trailer, let's say, came into our Greenville D.C. at once of compressors or something. Everywhere in the network we point to that when it was received and we ship it all over the country to get product to customers. Now we have that same product coming into every DC and so we're shipping shorter distances and that's a big benefit in terms of for us at this point. And the other benefit is we're not having to work over time in our distribution centers where we were a year ago, and that part of that goes into gross margin, too, because that's part of handling costs. So that -- those are the benefits we're seeing. And a lot of it -- supplier lead times are still slightly extended from before the pandemic, but they are getting much, much closer, and there are fewer outliers than we expected at this time.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's clear. And then, DG, I wanted to ask your opinion on AI. How do you think that might help Grainger? And what could the impact be to the industry?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah. I mean I won't go into too much detail. Obviously, AI has been a rating topic. If you think about artificial intelligence, or intelligence, there's machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence is their deep learning a lot of what's been talked about lately is deep learning generative AI, which you can write up your favorite song. We have been using machine learning for a long time and things like helping us get search right and effectively, I think the challenge here is to figure out where you can drive improvements through AI from customer interactions from operations for back office, and we have efforts going in all of those areas and it's like any other technology to point it to the right problem. And I think that's probably going to be the most important thing for us to think about as we learn more.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Jacob Levinson from Melius Research. Your line is now live.
Jacob Levinson: Good morning, everyone.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Dee Merriwether: Good morning.
Jacob Levinson: DG, maybe you can just give us a sense of how things are going north of the border in Canada. And I know that, that business has been on a long journey to get back on track. But maybe if you put in innings, what inning are all the in that way.
D.G. Macpherson: There's a lot of good signs, I would say, in Canada right now, I think we're seeing nice growth in the business, and we continue to see profitability improvements, we're probably in the fifth or sixth inning, I think, of getting to where we want to go. We are exactly on the path we expected to be on in terms of growth and profitability at this point. So the team there has done a really nice job of improving that business and working with the entire North American team to make sure that we are supporting the business and driving profitable growth. We feel pretty good about it.
Jacob Levinson: Okay. Great. And just shifting gears on the balance sheet for a second. Look, we've put positive commentary from quite a few other companies about M&A valuations coming in and maybe being one of the better markets for buyers in a long time. You've obviously got a maybe even an underlevered balance sheet and recall you talking about M&A for the first time, quite a while back at the Investor Day in the fall. I mean, is that -- is M&A is something that you see factoring in over the next months or so.
Dee Merriwether: So good question. I would say, with strong cash generation and M&A is always something that can be on the table. We have a small group here that looks for opportunities mostly in the capability space for us potentially, but nothing on the horizon as of yet. If you know our history, our view is not looking for a roll-up of smaller distributors that don't have a go-to-market focus that matches ours, which is selling on value and service to customers. So those are a little harder to find, I would say, but we do have a team stand that stood up to look at opportunities, but we don't see anything significant in the horizon.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from David Manthey from Baird. Your line is now live.
David Manthey: Thank you, good morning, everyone. In the past, Grainger's estimated market growth by triangulating things like GDP, industrial production, real business investment and nonfarm payrolls. And looking at those factors today, pretty much all of them low single digits and moderating and ISM is continuing to signal sort of further moderation. Could you remind us, as you look at 2023, how you're thinking about real MRO volume trends for the industry? I know you talked about pricing and share gain. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about the underlying market?
Dee Merriwether: Sure. Just to roll up what you said a little bit, we really focus on PPI and IP to -- as a predictor or outlook of the MRO market. And our estimates about where it stood as we put together our guide, which is showing volume down 3% to flat in the US and price between 4% and 5%. So that's where we were at the end of the year as we look at the latest updates of IP and PPI there about there. And so underlying a lot of our assumptions is the MRO market growth, including price and volume of about 1% to 5%.
David Manthey: Great. So no change. Thank you for that. Second, a soft side question here. Congratulations on the great places to work after accolades D.G, you've been with or working with Grainger for, I don't know, 20 years. And it seems there's been something of a cultural shift since you've been CEO. Could you assess the culture at Grainger today and how that's translating to the results you're seeing lately?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah. I mean it's a really interesting question. We -- Grainger has always had a wonderful culture, one where people really wanted to do the right thing for customers and very highly ethical company. About six years ago, we went through a process to say what needed to change. And we outlined a set of principles that we talk about at every meeting at every, every day basically and say are we in, in those principles. I think the things that have probably moved the most have been making sure we're starting with the customer, making sure we're competing with urgency and making sure we're acting with intent, meaning working on the things that really matter. I think our culture historically might have not always been as focused on a few things that matter and stay on them as long as needed to make them really great. And I think that's been a big focus for us as a leadership team. And I think that's probably a shift. I mean the shift is slow, to be fair, cultures don't change overnight, and so we're constantly working on it. The business I think we've been most focused on that have been a little bit different from the past.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Steve Volkmann: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. This one is a little bit lucy as well. But it feels like on the logistics and freight costs that there's sort of two things going on. Obviously, the cost of those things has come down, but then you're also managing it much better. And I guess I'm curious if there's more opportunity as we go forward just in terms of how you manage it to continue to see some gains in that area.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean I think we're -- I wouldn't -- so managing it better is probably relative. I think we did quite an amazing job of managing through the pandemic through what was a really difficult time in the supply chain. I think it was actually extraordinary looking back, I think. But I think now it's easier to manage because we actually have the product in the right place. And so we're able to let our system work the way it's intended to work. In terms of are there further opportunities, there are always further opportunities. We have an expectation that we will get better every single year from that productivity and service basis. The teams are always identifying things to work on that can improve our service to our customers and the productivity, and we'll continue to do that.
Steve Volkmann: Great. And then my follow-up is just your long-term kind of EPS targets from the Analyst Day. It seems like you're already pretty much there or getting close anyway. How do you think about revisiting those targets over time?
Dee Merriwether: So we had incredible progress towards those targets, as you can see in this quarter and then in the full year last year. But as we all are looking at the environment, the macro environment is still very fluid. And it's been incredibly difficult to forecast, at least more difficult than usual. With that being said, we are doing, of course, better than our performing better than our target, if you extrapolate our performance out. However, I would like to have a couple more data points underneath my belt and have the macro unfold a little bit more, especially with continued recession moving and predictions of a slowdown, and we will revisit those estimates at the right time.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Pat Baumann from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Pat Baumann: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Quickly on the April growth rate at constant currency. Is that -- has that been consistent across segments? And then from a seasonality perspective, how do you feel about the progression you're seeing from March to April? Is it stable with how things normally have been, or have you seen any slowing relative to kind of the first quarter trends?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So as we built the plan for this year, we knew that our comparison would get harder as the year went along because we came out of the pandemic in every month last year, we effectively got better. So I'd say we're right where we expect to be right now. The 11% is seasonality-wise, is normal. And the relative growth rate is only down slightly because we continue to improve through the year last year. So we're basically on what we expected to see at this point.
Pat Baumann: Got it. And in terms of Zoro, there was a leadership change there during the quarter. Curious if there's status quo as you look forward, or is there going to be any kind of shifts in kind of the way the business is run with the new leader in place?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So the Masaya Suzuki, who is the CEO of MonotaRO also leads that business and the person reporting to him Kevin he's been with us for 15 years left to take a CEO job, which was great for him. And Sandy Mattison who Officer has moved in, I don't expect to see big shifts Sandy knows the business well, and we're just continuing to push on the core initiatives and Masaya is still supporting her and we're supporting her to make sure we can continue to improve that business and grow.
Operator: Thank you Next question is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Tyler Boyd on for Deane Dray. Just looking at Slide 21, it looks like was fairly broad-based across end markets. Maybe you noted a little bit of slowing maybe in consumer retail end markets. Is there anything else that you'd call out where demand is waning particularly strong?
D.G. Macpherson: No, I think you're hitting on it. I think that's right. I think consumer-facing businesses are slowing much more than industrial. But generally, I would say that the pattern is more industrial is doing better, less industrial is slowing more and then bigger companies are generally doing better, I'd say, than smaller companies are.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's it for me. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Katie Fleischer from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Katie Fleischer: Hi. Kind of going off of the prior question, can you just talk about if you've seen any divergence between your small- and medium-sized customers versus the national accounts?
D.G. Macpherson: We see -- with the high-touch model, we've seen pretty good growth with midsized customers and with national accounts, for sure. I would say the midsized customers are growing significantly faster than national accounts had seen a couple of years ago. So we do feel like, and we see that through the Zoro model too, where we're seeing businesses maybe not grow as fast as larger businesses. But in general, we're still seeing good growth with the high touch across both national accounts and advertised customers.
Katie Fleischer: Okay. And then just for my follow-up. So one of your competitors recently talked about a slowing cadence of manufacturing activity through the month of March. I was just wondering if you've seen any sort of similar dynamic or any demand issues that you're concerned about?
D.G. Macpherson: I mean, well, certainly, we -- in the fourth quarter, we saw low 20s growth in manufacturing in the first quarter, we saw mid-teens growth with manufacturing. So still growing strong, a lot of this is sort of looking back at what happened with the pandemic, and we saw huge growth rates coming as we recovered and now we're sort of moderating. But we still see, I'd say, I was with some customers I talked about in the opening. And all of the -- one of them was probably going to shrink a little bit this year, but that was on huge compares to the two years before. So it's not like it's -- activity is not strong. It's just less not growing as much and the other two are going to grow. So I think I think we're still manufacturing activity in general at this point.
Operator: Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to D.G. for any further closing comments.
D.G. Macpherson: All right. Thanks for joining us. I appreciate you know it's a busy earnings day in the world today. So thanks for taking the time. I would just finish by wanting to thank our team for the right work they're doing to make sure that we continue to gain share continue to serve our customers well and do it the right way. And with that, I'll say goodbye. Thanks for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q4 earnings release, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. This morning's call will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2022 adjusted results, which exclude the gain related to the divestiture of Cromwell's enterprise software business, which was sold in the fourth quarter. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to discuss some of our key accomplishments from 2022, and then I'll pass it to Dee to walk through the specifics of our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2023. Turning to Slide 4. The Grainger Edge framework has been instrumental in guiding our work in 2022. We know that when we live our principles, focus on the things that matter and serve our customers well, we can achieve great things. Our customer base is very broad. I've been with customers that are seeing positive economic signs like aerospace, and I've also been with other customers like some retailers that are seeing some concerning economic signs. But in general, our customers continue to be busy, and Grainger has and will remain the trusted partner of providing value to their operations every day. As we look to 2023 and beyond, we are excited to continue living out the Grainger Edge starting with the customer and serving as their valued partner through any cycle. In 2022, the Grainger team stayed relentlessly focused on what matters most, providing our customers exceptional service, supporting each other and making a positive impact on our communities and the environment. In both models, we made strategic investments to support customers and build the business for the future. This included adding supply chain capacity, including a new bulk warehouse in the U.S. and the start-up of the Anegawa distribution center in Japan, expanding our digital and data capabilities, including progress with our customer and product information systems, in our high-touch business and improved account management tools and our endless assortment model, and executing against our merchandising and marketing initiatives, including temp search and recommendation functionality. During the year, we also continued to strengthen our purpose-driven culture by ensuring Grainger is a place where our team members can be their true cells and have a fulfilling career. We continue to receive external recognition for our workplace culture. But what means the most to me and the rest of the leadership team is the positive feedback from team members about why they choose to build their career at Grainger. And finally, we continue to make progress with our environmental, social and governance objectives, both internally and in supporting our customers to help them achieve their own ESG goals. The result of this focus was an outstanding year of profitable growth, and we are extremely proud of our results, which surpassed our own expectations throughout the year. Turning to Slide 6. We finished the year with over $15.2 billion in sales, up 16.5% on a daily basis or 19.3% in daily constant currency as demand across the business remains strong. In our high-touch business in North America, we focused on our growth engines and achieved approximately 775 basis points of U.S. market outgrowth in 2022, far exceeding our updated target of 400 to 500 basis points. In the endless assortment model, both Zoro and MonotaRO made progress to achieve high-teens growth in local currency and local days. During the year, we drove 215 basis points of gross margin improvement, which, when coupled with 40 basis points of SG&A leverage resulted in 255 basis points of operating margin expansion and a nearly 50% increase in adjusted EPS. We also generated over $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 42% over 2021 and returned $949 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We accomplished this while also improving our ROIC by 870 basis points to 40.6%. The strong 2022 financials were the result of staying focused throughout the year on what truly matters to our customers, our suppliers and our team members, and we are well positioned to continue this momentum into 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and our outlook.
Dee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 results for the total company, it was a solid quarter to finish out this year. And while you'll notice some noise as we walk through the financials, at the end of the day, we delivered great results. Sales growth in the quarter was 13.2% or 17.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which normalizes for the impact of the depreciating yen. Our results this quarter included strong growth in both segments as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. This includes approximately 800 basis points of share gain in the U.S. high-touch business and high-teens growth in local currency across endless assortment. Total company gross profit margin in the quarter was 39.6%, expanding 230 basis points over the prior year fourth quarter driven by increases in both segments and including a favorable year-over-year impact from year-end inventory adjustments, which I'll detail in a moment. The strong gross margin performance was partially offset by a decrease in SG&A leverage in the quarter. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and also incurred an aggregate $35 million in non-recurring items in the quarter. This includes a one-time bonus to most hourly employees within high touch to recognize their significant contributions towards our 2022 performance. Excluding these one-time non-recurring items, total company SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been roughly flat year-over-year. Despite these non-recurring costs, we still finished the quarter with operating margin up 135 basis points over the prior year period. This profitable growth resulted in diluted EPS of $7.14 for the fourth quarter, representing a 31% increase versus the fourth quarter 2021, another strong quarter of performance. In our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to see strong growth with daily sales up 16.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We saw continued positive growth in all major customer end markets across the segment, including over 20% growth in natural resources, transportation and heavy manufacturing. The daily sales increase in the U.S. of over 17% was fueled by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued strong price realization of over 11% in the quarter. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 7% or 17.2% in local days in local currency. For the segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 41.9%, achieving 225 basis points of margin expansion. During the quarter, the segment benefited from lower freight costs and continued improvement in product mix. Margin was also favorably impacted by year-end inventory adjustments as we lap the unfavorable LIFO adjustment from the prior year period and also recorded a positive net inventory adjustment in the current year period. The net impact of these inventory adjustments was around 130 basis points for the segment. Price/cost spread in the quarter was also roughly neutral. Moving to SG&A. The segment delevered by about 35 basis points, which was driven by continued investments in marketing and headcount to support growth. In addition, the segment incurred $29 million in non-recurring items in the period, including the one-time bonus payment previously discussed and some accounting true-ups to close the year. While we did modestly delever SG&A, we still expanded operating margins by 190 basis points year-over-year, finishing with a 15.5% operating margin for the segment. This is a strong finish for our High-Touch team. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price inflation, grew between 9% and 10%, implying we outpaced the market by roughly 800 basis points in the quarter. This strong finish helped us deliver 775 basis points of market outgrowth for the full year 2022. We continue to have great success in gaining share as we execute against our strategic growth engines in our High-Touch model. We remain confident in our ability to deliver the 400 to 500 basis points of annual outgrowth going forward and are excited to continue partnering with our customers and our suppliers to drive value for all parties each and every day. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, reported and daily sales increased 0.9% or 18.2% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for the significant impact of the depreciating yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 19.4% growth and Zoro U.S. was up 19.5%. Revenue growth continues to be driven by strong new customer acquisition and repeat business for the segment as well as enterprise customer growth at MonotaRO. Gross margin for this segment expanded 170 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2022 as we saw strong price realization, coupled with continued freight efficiencies as average order values have increased year-over-year. We also benefited from favorable business unit mix as Zoro grew faster than MonotaRO in the quarter. Segment operating margin declined 180 basis points as favorable gross margin was more than offset by heightened SG&A costs. While Zoro's operating margins were roughly flat in the quarter, MonotaRO was impacted by start-up costs at the new Anegawa DC as well as non-recurring asset retirement costs related to the upcoming closure of the Amagasaki facility. As we lap the DC transition costs and ramp a new facility to peak efficiency, we expect profitability will begin trending towards more normal levels as we move through 2023. On Slide 12, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined, up 17% over the prior year. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro SKU portfolio, now at over 11 million SKUs. And in 2022, the team successfully delivered on our stated goal to add 2 million SKUs per year over the next several years. In summary, a great job of spending the Endless Assortment flywheel by both Zoro and MonotaRO in 2022. I also want to acknowledge the exciting news that our Zoro U.S. business surpassed $1 billion in annual sales in 2022, the first time they exceeded that threshold in their history. It's been an amazing success story since we launched this business back in 2011, and we remain excited about what Masaya, Kevin and the rest of the Zoro team will accomplish going forward. Moving to our outlook. Despite the economic uncertainty heading into 2023, our high-level earnings algorithm remains intact. Within our High-Touch segment, over the longer-term economic cycle, we target growing 400 to 500 basis points faster than the U.S. MRO market and remain confident in our ability to do so. In our Endless Assortment segment, we expect to continue our track record of strong growth, both in the U.S. and in Japan. At the total company level, we target generally stable gross margin performance over time while sticking to our core pricing tenant, and as we strive to grow SG&A slower than sales to help expand operating margin. Couple this with our balanced and consistent approach to capital allocation, and we can drive attractive returns over the long term as we've done especially well over the last few years. So what does this mean for 2023? At the total company, we expect revenue between $16.2 billion and $16.8 billion, with daily sales growth between 7% and 11%, driven by strong top line performance in both segments. Note that this range is 40 basis points lower on a reported basis when factoring in one less selling day in 2023. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily sales growth between 5% and 9.5%. In the U.S., we're planning for MRO market growth between 1% and 5%, comprised of a volume range of flat to down 3% coupled with price inflation between 4% and 5%, largely representing the wrap of 2022 price increases. On top of a 1% to 5% market, we expect to continue executing against our strategic growth engines to achieve 400 to 500 basis points of U.S. market outgrowth in 2023. In the Endless Assortment segment, we anticipate daily sales to grow between 16% and 18% or roughly 17% to 19% in daily constant currency when factoring in 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwind at the segment level from the Japanese yen. Zoro is anticipated to grow within the segment range, reflecting further SKU expansion and a continued focus on acquiring and retaining high-value business customers. MonotaRO is also expected to grow within the segment range and local currency as they continue to grow with both small businesses and large enterprise customers. Moving to our margin expectations. We expect strong performance in both segments with stable to expanding performance in High-Touch Solutions and improving profitability in Endless Assortment. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect gross profit in the year to be flat to slightly down as we anticipate some of the price/cost favorability experienced in 2022 to unwind as we trend back to neutrality over the long term. We expect this headwind will be partially offset by freight favorability given the improvement in container cost and the current outlook for diesel prices. On the SG&A side, we will continue to make incremental investments toward our strategic initiatives as we fuel our growth algorithm. We will also have some tailwinds as we lap the non-recurring items that hit in the fourth quarter and a certain expenses like variable compensation reset in the new year. Overall, in total, we expect SG&A leverage to be favorable, and therefore, when combined with our top line growth expectations, we anticipate operating margin of 16.3% to 16.8% in High-Touch for 2023. In the Endless Assortment segment, we expect MonotaRO's operating margins to improve year-over-year as they continue to benefit from favorable freight efficiencies and strong price realization. At Zoro, we expect operating margins to continue to ramp as they gain leverage on their cost base. Overall, this represents operating margin for the segment between 8.6% and 9%, an improvement of 60 to 100 basis points compared to 2022. Growing this up for total company, we expect to gain SG&A leverage of 30 to 60 basis points to offset a modest decline in gross margin, resulting in operating margin between 14.4% and 14.9% for the full year. Turning now to capital allocation, we expect the business will continue to generate strong cash flow in the year with an expected range of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion, an increase of over $215 million at the midpoint compared to 2022. We expect to use this cash to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. As discussed at our Investor Day in September, we plan to invest in our DC network over the next few years to support strong growth and to maintain industry-leading service levels. With this, we anticipate capital spending in the range of $450 million to $525 million in 2023. This includes DC capacity investments to expand our service advantage in the U.S. as well as the start of a new DC project in Tokyo. We are also continuing to invest in technology to further our customer and product information advantage and we'll continue spending on accretive ESG investment across the portfolio. We expect to continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in line with our historical approach. This will include share repurchases to the tune of $550 million to $700 million and a strong cash dividend, which we've increased consistently for the past 51 years and expect to do so again here in 2023. Summarizing the high-level points on Slide 17, you can see these revenue, profitability and capital allocation expectations translate to adjusted EPS of $32 to $34.50 per share, a 7.9 to 16.3 percentage increase over 2022, and nearly double our pre-pandemic 2019 adjusted EPS of $17.29. We are off to a really strong start in January with preliminary total company daily sales of 16% or around 19% in daily constant currency. We do expect growth rates will be stronger in the first half as results will benefit from a more pronounced price wrap. In the second half, we will face tougher comps and have modeled a slower economic cycle. On profitability, while every year is different, we do expect gross margins will generally follow our traditional seasonal pattern with a high water mark in the first quarter and sequential declines in the second and third quarters. We anticipate SG&A will be reasonably consistent over the course of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I want to first and foremost, thank the Grainger team as well as our customers and supplier partners who have helped to drive such a successful year. We truly kept the world working in 2022 and in turn achieved outstanding results for the year, both financially and operationally. I am excited for what is to come in 2023 and remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, the liver follows experience to drive profitable growth over the long haul. With our team's continued commitment to focusing on the things that matter, we are well poised to deliver in any macro environment. With that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.
Tommy Moll: I'll ask two, both on High-Touch. Let's start on pricing there. It looks like for 2023, four to five points of growth on price. Dee, I think you heard -- I think I heard you say that most, but maybe not all of that is a wrap, but if you could comment there on the wrap versus any new initiatives? And then also just a related point, are there any areas of pricing pressure? That's something that's been picked up in the marketplace this quarter elsewhere. And I just wonder if you've seen any of that in your business.
Dee Merriwether: So I'll start with the first part and then maybe D.G. can add in a little bit on what he's hearing from -- what he's hearing from some customers on the visit. So, yes, when we look at the market outlook, it includes both price and volume. And so the sum of that, we believe, will be somewhere in the range of 1% to 5% of the total market. We believe that volume will be down 3% to flat. And as you know, at price, up 4% to up 5%, we have more visibility into our pricing than anyone. And so when we look at price, we are also taking into account our wrap, which is basically the price increases that we took in 2022 and their full impact to 2023. So, we still see a little bit more price coming our way. So, it takes that three-ish percent up to about 4% to 5% from for the price outlook.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Tommy, I would say most of the -- if there's deflationary pressure, it's mostly due to commodities. So there are -- we have -- we've taken prices up and down across the assortment and the ones that are down are almost always very commodity intensive. So they're very steel-intensive or very -- some specific commodity intensive. So, we do see -- we do see that broad market pressure. We don't see that much. It's more specific commodities that we're seeing right now.
Tommy Moll: That's helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on the volume -- the volume outlook for High-Touch flat to down three. And D.G., you mentioned at least one area of strength in aero and one area of relative weakness in retail. But I'm just curious, as you roll it all up into that full year outlook, are there other areas of weakness you're already seeing? Or is it more just potentially some conservatism around the back half? Anything you could provide there would be helpful.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. We're really sticking to what the market projections are at this point. In terms of -- you heard the January results. We aren't seeing a lot of weakness to be fair at this point. We do expect in the back half, there to be more challenges from a volume perspective. What I would say is every customer we have has a COVID-fueled story about what's happened to their volume over the past few years and where they've been determines whether they're facing pressures now or whether they're seeing optimism. So obviously, with aerospace, they -- we shut down the airlines for a long time and they now have orders. So they're starting to build up. And that's going to take a couple more years to actually get the full speed, we think, with aerospace. With some, they may have forward loaded some of their volume because they were selling things that were very important during the pandemic, and now they're faced with situations where things are slowing down. So, I would say every customer has their own story, net-net, that we're not seeing any real softness as of yet, and that's showing in the numbers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please state your question.
Ryan Merkel: Nice quarter. I wanted to start with a couple of questions on price cost. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more. So last quarter, I think price cost held by 60 basis points. And then in the fourth quarter, it was flat. I'm just curious, why does it move around so much. And then I think you're managing the price cost being neutral. But typically in the past, when there's a lot of inflation, right, your gross margins would expand. I'm curious how you're sort of managing to that price cost neutral.
Dee Merriwether: Well, if you're specifically focused on GP in the U.S., our gross margins have expanded, if you look over a longer period of time here. And as it relates to price cost, just want to reiterate, when we talk about neutrality, we do talk about that over time. And we have continued to speak about the fact that price cost just like GP is lumpy. We have a cost cycle, which we have traditionally had for years that really didn't hold last year because of how fast cost inflation was coming in to suppliers. So that makes the cost piece of that a little bit lumpier. And then if you recall, we have the opportunity based upon our percentage of revenue, highly contracted. We have the right to introduce price at different periods during the time. We also have web price, which is also a good portion of our business, and we can pass price on web at any particular time. So that is the lumpiness. It's the timing of when we can actually price plus the timing of when cost actually comes through. And that's why our focus is doing that over a period of time and when it makes sense, both for our supply base as well as for our customer base.
Ryan Merkel: Okay. That makes sense. And then my follow-up, I think you had 9% price mix in '22. And my question is, is that 9% also included in your definition of the MRO market? And really what I'm getting at is, did Grainger have more price in '22 than the market? And if so, why?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Maybe I'll cover that. First of all, I think that the way you measure price inflation is probably not common across everybody. So you dive into the details that we don't really know how others are talking about price inflation, so we wouldn't comment on that. I think the thing I would point to is, to Dee's point, we generally think of price as pricing to the market, and we are very confident that what we have now is market competitive, and we look at that very, very, very closely, given our history, you might understand why we would do that. And so we are more wired on how we price competitive. As you said, there's really a lot of lumpiness. We may have taken price later than others or some may have taken earlier who knows. But the reality is that we are very competitive now and feel like we're in a good position on pricing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Deane Dray: Could we touch on freight for a second? It looked like that rate efficiencies helped you on price cost, if I read that correctly, but it still sounds like there's freight inflation. So where does that stand today?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So our price cost does not include freight the way we define it for you. So freight is a separate issue. Obviously, we consider freight in everything we do. Like everybody, we saw huge freight increases during 2021 and 2022. That has certainly moderated. It's still above 2019 levels fairly substantially, but we have seen that come down quite a bit. So -- and we talked about for this year, we expect it to be a benefit in terms of some of the moderating prices. And some of that is sort of obvious places the containers from overseas or a lot cheaper than they were six months ago, quite a bit. They're still relatively higher than 2019, but getting closer. Other parts of the market are still tight. So net-net, we still feel like it will be a small benefit this year for sure.
Deane Dray: That's helpful. And then a follow-up on the supply chain. Just where does it stand today in efficiencies? What kind of lead times are you seeing and expectations about returning to normal?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean, it's a great question. So what I would say is that -- from our perspective, once we have the product to -- when customers get it, that part of the supply chain is all good. We were basically clean every night, barring a storm in Dallas or something that we've seen in the last couple of days where people won't pick up. But in general, the supply chain on the outbound side, both in our buildings and then our freight partners is very, very good. On the inbound side, we still have some elongated supply chains. It's gotten much better in the past four or five months, and we expect to continue to get better. At normal, I think I'd probably say in quotes now. I do expect it to get closer to 2019 lead times, but maybe not quite all the way there as the year progresses, but we do expect it to continue to get better.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead.
Chris Snyder: And congrats on a really great year. Market outgrowth for the U.S. High-Touch business has continued to improve despite presumably better product availability across your smaller competitors. So it seems like the strategic initiatives are certainly taking hold. So I guess my question with that, does this change the way you think about the 400 to 500 basis points of outgrowth? And should we think about price as part of that outgrowth? It sounds like a lot of the questioning seems to suggest that you guys are overpricing the market. But it just feels like with the digital divide we're seeing and the increased importance that brings to customers, I would suspect you guys should be able to outprice the smaller regional competitors who do not offer that.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean I guess I would say just from a core sort of principle for us, we think of outgrowth in terms of volume, we expect price to be relatively neutral. You're right, we make it modest benefits over time that can happen. But certainly, what we're talking about is volume outgrowth. The position from last year, certainly, we got some benefit from supply chain fairly modest. And what we do is we sort of decouple that analytically and look at what our initiatives are doing, and that's how we came up with the 400 to 500 basis point target at the Analyst Day, we're still sticking with that. I mean, obviously, we've done a little better than that. But for now, we're not changing that. That's our expectation going forward.
Chris Snyder: And then for my follow-up, I wanted to talk about the High-Touch favorable mix during the quarter, typically mixed screens as transitory. But on the last call, the Company talked about the mix benefit coming from an increased focus on technical products. And just given the strategic nature of that, it sounds more structural, so just hoping for more color on how to think about mix going forward.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we have a favorable mix. Mix for us generally means product mix here. And so you can imagine during 2020 and 2021, in particular, we had a very negative mix because we had -- we were selling any mask in the world we could find, we're selling it, and that is a lower margin product. I would say we are more back to normal now in terms of the industrial products that we have typically sold, and that's been a favorable mix for us. And certainly, we are working hard to make sure that we can compete with technical products or industrial products, and that will be a focus for us going forward. But most of the mix benefit has been getting -- really getting back to normal is the way I describe it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jake Levinson with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Jake Levinson: D.G., are you guys still experiencing any kind of labor issues either at the factory level or otherwise? Just thinking about kind of the mix signals we're seeing in the labor market. You still got wage inflation at the lower end and seemingly a lot of competition and warehouses and factories and whatnot, but just curious what -- how that translates for you guys.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Well, I mean -- so a couple of things. One is we certainly, we had wage labor challenges 18 months ago, a year ago. We have made adjustments in wages for our team members. I would say we are in a much, much better position. Our churn rates are back to normal basically in most parts of the business. And we are in a much more stable staffing pattern than we've been. And I mentioned some of the outbound, our DCs are performing well. Our call centers are performing well. We don't have as much churn -- near as much churn as we did at the peak, and we're really close to back to normal at this point.
Jake Levinson: That's helpful. And just switching gears, I guess, as a consumer when you get a lot of inflation, you see people switching from the premium product to the private label brand. Are you seeing that kind of trend in your business where customers that might want to prefer your Grainger brand over some of the marquee brands, if you will.
D.G. Macpherson: You know, not. We aren't seeing a big shift there. I would say that most customers, when they're buying industrial products, they need the product for the application they're using it for. And so if our private brand works that we use it and they always have. But generally, we aren't seeing certainly a down shift to lower cost products. That's not what we're seeing right now.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.
Christopher Glynn: So I think last quarter, another topic that came into the improved mix discussion for HTS was the result of the merchandising initiatives. So drilling into that, is that trend kind of in the input there full throttle now or still ramping up? And is that kind of expected to be a good guide driver for an indefinite number of years?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, it's the latter, Chris. So we've -- we started this initiative three or four years ago. We've worked through sort of some initial category reviews. We keep getting better at them. What we've discovered is that we've learned a ton as we've gone, and we're just getting better and better at it and there's still a lot of improvement to be made. It will be a consistent benefit for us, we believe, going forward for the foreseeable future, sort of that midterm three- to five-year time frame. We still see a lot of benefit from improving the way we merge. And it's core to what we do. I mean helping customers have confidence that they found the right product, it's kind of what we do. So getting better at that seems to have a good result, and we're going to continue to really push hard on that.
Christopher Glynn: And to be clear, that's just highlighting higher value-add products within categories for the most part?
D.G. Macpherson: No. We are -- I would say we are agnostic to what the -- not agnostic to the economics, but agnostic to sort of identifying higher-value products. We're trying to make it super easy for customers to find what they need. And so it's really all about, do we have the right assortment, can we present it in a way that makes it really easy for customers to find so they can have a lot of confidence that they're getting the product that they need to use for the right application.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: First off, I'm interested in understanding how you capture a LIFO benefit when both inventories and the LIFO reserve are up quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. I just if you could go through the mechanics of that, I'd appreciate it.
Dee Merriwether: Sure, sure, Dave. So I'll go back to last year, you just start with that because there was two things. We're lapping last year's -- it was unfavorable last year, favorably this year adjustment. And if you recall last year, we had a sharp increase in cost, and then we had an outsized amount of inventory kind of get delivered in the fourth quarter. And that combination of those two factors happening at the same time, resulted in us recording a meaningful LIFO adjustment to our fourth quarter adjustments in 2021. Now looking at that and understanding that we were still in an inflationary period as it relates to cost and we saw costs still coming in. From our suppliers, we worked on improving our processes, tightening our processes, making sure that we were booking entries and looking at the process, not just from the financials, but with the chain leaders to ensure our inventory valuation was staying up to par as we move through the year. So I feel like we did a much better job there. However, when you look at the inventory that was sold through in the last quarter of the year, it required us to take a favorable LIFO adjustment to correct for that. Because if something has an increase for those that don't know, something has an increase in the quarter, it haven't sold it or the price change in that quarter from when it changed early in the year, the LIFO adjustment causes you to refactor all of those sales to the latest cost. So that adjustment was favorable for us. The combination of those two year-over-year in Q4 resulted in about 130 basis points, a net 130 basis point year-over-year impact to GP for the High-Touch business.
David Manthey: Okay. And the second, the share gains that you've been seeing has clearly been terrific. Could you discuss the balance that you're seeing between new customer adds and selling more to existing customers? I would imagine there's a difference between High-Touch and Endless Assortment. But could you just give us some color on that.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean in High-Touch, so I would just say that in High-Touch that the vast majority of our share gain is the existing customers. The reality is that the Grainger brand sells something to most large and midsized customers' business customers in a year. And so a vast majority of those are -- the share gains we're seeing are actually share of wallet as opposed to new customer acquisitions. In the Endless Assortment, it's more balanced. We're seeing in Japan, we're seeing a mix of new customers, but also significant growth with existing customers. And at Zoro, we're seeing nice retention rates. So we are seeing more balance between new customer acquisition and volume and existing customer volume in the Endless assortment model.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Ken Newman: I think the midpoint of guide implies SG&A leverage of, call it, high teens for 2023 at the midpoint. Just remind me how much of the SG&A spend is fixed versus variable at this point? And should we think about high teens as kind of the right way for SG&A leverage to progress if sales stay at this at or above mid-single-digit growth going forward?
Dee Merriwether: So the -- if you're looking at our guide, the guide is implying 30 to 60 basis points of SG&A leverage for next year. And as I think about that, let's remember a couple of things. We're continuing to invest in demand generation, and we had some one-time costs this year that we don't expect to impact us next year. And I will say the -- one of the last things to consider is going into a new year, we get to reset our variable cost like variable costs such as variable compensation back to a 100% of our plan. And then we have some modest productivity that we built into the plan because we focus our organization on looking at driving standard work automation and productivity every day. So, we don't have to have huge events. We do that in times when things are going really well, and we can scale and also when things are tightening up. So, those are the numbers that I had related to the type of SG&A leverage we're looking to gain. And remember, that's in the midst of us continuing to invest.
Ken Newman: That's helpful. For my follow-up here, it does look like inventories took a decent step up from the third quarter to fourth quarter, which makes sense given the sales guide increase. Can you just provide some color on what's embedded in the operating cash guide for how inventories and working capital trend throughout the year?
Dee Merriwether: Can you repeat that question again?
D.G. Macpherson: What can happen to have inventory levels next year and working capital next year?
Dee Merriwether: So with that investment, it also includes some investments in DC capacity. So we expect to continue to build inventory as we stand up some of those new buildings. We do expect to see some slight improvement in working capital as far as it is not diminishing as much as it has in the last couple of years because we were investing much more significantly in inventory, say, last year, and we're starting to see some improvement and our accounts receivable execution as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Chris Dankert: I guess looking at the margin guide for analyst assortment, pretty impressive expansion in '23 expected here. How do we think about kind of the long-term path towards that 11% margin guide? I mean does the DC investment in Tokyo, what else should we be thinking about in terms of cost and investments in '24 and beyond maybe as we think about Endless Assortment profitability over time here?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So I mean the two biggest portions of the Endless Assortment are on our Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. MonotaRO, their profitability in the last year was deflated by operating two buildings at once in the in the Osaka area. That goes away. So they'll see some improvement next year. They will be investing in a building in the Tokyo region in the next several years. But generally, I think the pattern for them will be getting closer back to where they were prior to the dual DC Osaka situation. So, we would expect them to improve over time. And then we talked a lot about Zoro U.S. We expect that to get a kind of high single-digit operating margins over the next several years. And so that combination gets you to sort of that long-term guidance.
Chris Dankert: Okay. And just to put a finer point on that last piece about Tokyo. I mean, will that have a similar impact as the stand of Osaka did in terms of operating two facilities that once whenever that investment comes through?
Dee Merriwether: So, we expect -- so, the Anegawa DC that went up and getting out of Amagasaki in 2023, the first half, they will still be incurring some costs as well as wrapping up to their full efficiency. In the midst of that, they're also launching Phase 2 of the Anegawa DC, which has additional cost -- so our expectation is that they will end the year in 2023 or exit that year with op margin rate similar to what you saw prior to both product.
D.G. Macpherson: I think Chris was asking a different question, which you were asking about Tokyo, whether it's going to be a similar issue with Tokyo when that comes on board. The answer is who knows. It depends on the pattern of the timing and when things open. It may or may not be as impactful, but we'll comment on that as we get closer to that's three or four years out so.
Operator: And our next question comes from Pat Baumann with JPMorgan. Please go ahead and state your question.
Pat Baumann: A quick one, I think you're expecting on gross margin for the fourth quarter, like 38% to 34%. Can you just walk from what you were expecting to that 39.6% that you reported kind of like what surprised you? You called out LIFO benefit, but that's like a year-over-year impact. So I'm not sure if that's like the entire bridge to that 39.6%. I know, it's 1/3 year-over-year, but I'm not sure that that's like the difference in kind of where you came in at versus what you expected. So maybe color on that.
Dee Merriwether: Sure. So admittedly, we did end stronger than what we expected as we continue to execute well. And a number of things as you kind of note went our way. So we talked about one of them earlier. We got some tailwind from freight efficiencies with both fuel and container costs coming down over the last couple of months. In addition to that, we did get some price/cost timing benefits as we look to implement some web prices, we implemented some web prices in the quarter ahead of our January price increases, so that helped us a bit. And then if you break away the inventory valuation adjustment this year from what we saw last year that was more something that wasn't anticipated. So that inventory valuation adjustment that we booked in the quarter that was favorable, that was the third piece.
Pat Baumann: Okay. Is it kind of like in that order in terms of like the magnitude of difference?
Dee Merriwether: I would say, if you take all three, it was about 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3 from a value perspective.
Pat Baumann: Great. And then my follow-up is just on -- it's also on gross margin, just to guide for '23. Just wondering what the assumptions are kind of behind that modest contraction for some of these moving parts? Like is it price/cost negative which is offset by freight kind of those wash out and then kind of the decline is like just kind of segment mix related? Or is there anything in there for kind of the inventory adjustment dynamics to think about? Just wondering that year-over-year guide, how to think about the moving parts for that.
Dee Merriwether: No, I think you said it exactly right. I can repeat what you said, but we have some price/cost benefit timing. Some of that may fall away. We may have some freight efficiencies. Those may or may not cover that completely up. And then you've got the business unit mix between Endless Assortment and High-Touch and the fact that Endless Assortment is going to grow faster. So it has a negative impact.
Operator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the call over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Thanks for joining us today. I really appreciate you jumping on the call. Hopefully, you get a sense that we feel pretty good about the path we're on. We've had at a really good year, but we're more excited about the future and driving things to help our customers operate better and help them succeed. So with that, I'll just say thanks for joining again, and hope you stay safe. If you're going to get cold, I think, in the Northeast. So, hopefully, you don't ice up too much. That does affect us too. But have a great rest of the week. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger’s third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q3 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning’s call will focus on our third quarter 2022 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for the respective quarterly periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from US GAAP, and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO’s public statements. Now, I’ll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to provide an overview of our third quarter performance and I'll pass it to Dee to walk through the financials. As I typically do, I'd like to start with our Grainger Edge framework, which guides our strategy and behaviors across the company and with our customer and supply partners. One of our Grainger Edge principles is to do the right thing. No word is that commitment more obvious than when we respond to the natural disasters. Grainger's long history of being there for our customers before, during and after a crisis strikes. Last month, Hurricane Ian destroyed parts of the US, most notably in Southwest Florida. Our team spent days, nights, and weekends on the front lines, working long hours to get essential products like generators, sandbags, and tarps to our customers. After the storm passed, our sellers on-site service representatives and branch team members are on the ground making sure we serve our customers, and many of them did this while balancing their own personal recovery efforts. We know the road ahead will not be easy, but the Grainger team will continue to be there to support the community as they recover and rebuild. Before I get into the financial highlights from the quarter, I want to talk a little bit about what I've seen and heard during my market visits with customers. I recently visited an outdoor equipment manufacturer that experienced a surge in demand during the pandemic. As consumers had excess cash and a desire to spend more time outside during COVID, they saw a major uptick in revenue. They're now facing a dip in demand as consumers begin to pull back on spending. I've also visited some of our aerospace customers where it's clear that business activity has picked up, especially in 2022 as COVID impacts have diminished. The industry is now making investments in new airplanes and other equipment to meet ongoing changes in business and leisure travel demands. All told, we continue to experience a dynamic market, with some industry still on the upswing, some that are stabilized, and others that are trending down. And while our customers will face different levels of impact as we navigate through this inflationary period, we know that Grainger wins because of our ability to add tangible value to our customers' operations through inventory management, digital solutions, and product substitutes. This has been true in past economic cycles, and we expect to continue as more and more customers turn to us for solutions, thanks to our relevant product offering, know-how, and advantaged supply chain. Turning now to our results. We performed very well in the third quarter with sales growth of 16.9% or 20.3% on a daily constant currency basis. This normalizes for the impact to the significantly depreciating Japanese yen. Our results this quarter include strong growth in both segments as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. We outgrew the US MRO market by 700 basis points in our US High-Touch business and delivered over 23% sales growth in Endless Assortment on a daily constant currency basis. Total company gross profit margin finished the quarter at 38.5%, expanding 145 basis points over the prior year third quarter. Profitability was strong throughout the quarter, was especially strong in the month of September as we benefited from a confluence of factors, including some timing benefits that provided a tailwind to gross margin. Steve will outline the details in a few minutes. Strong gross margin performance, coupled with solid SG&A leverage, helped us achieve 15.3% operating margin, an increase of 230 basis points over the prior year third quarter. We delivered adjusted ROIC of nearly 42%, up over 1,000 basis points compared to the same period last year. We also generated $380 million in operating cash flow and returned $286 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Due to the strong results achieved in the quarter and continued strong trends in October, we are again raising our 2022 full year guidance, starting with the customer and living our Grainger Edge principles is helping us deliver value to all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to discuss the details.
Dee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. As D.G. highlighted, it was another quarter of exceptional results, which are summarized at the total company level on Slide 7. We delivered strong growth and gross margin performance across both segments and also manage our SG&A well, driving 85 basis points of leverage in the quarter as we continue to stay disciplined, while investing to support long-term sustainable growth. This growth in profitability resulted in diluted EPS for the quarter of $8.27, up 46.4% versus third quarter of 2021. Turning now to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the third quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 19.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021. We saw a broad-based double-digit growth across all geographies and over 20% growth with both midsized and large customers in the US. Daily sales growth in the US of 20% was fueled by broad-based volume growth and strong price realization of over 12% in the quarter. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 11.4% or 15.5% in local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 40.6%, achieving 125 basis points of margin expansion. The increase is primarily due to product mix as well as favorable price/cost spread, realizing a timing benefit as we continue to work through cost discussions with our suppliers. Price/cost was also aided by some targeted customer and product actions as we work to ensure we are receiving the right economics for the value we provide to customers. These favorable contributors to gross margin were partially offset by heightened freight costs in the quarter. Our pricing team continues to do a really nice job managing through this highly inflationary environment. And while the timing will always be choppy from quarter-to-quarter, we remain focused on our core pricing tenets of achieving price/cost neutrality over time while ensuring our prices remain market competitive. Increased SG&A spend in this segment was driven primarily by higher headcount to support growth and compensation costs as well as continued investments in marketing. Even with the increased investment, we delivered 150 basis points of SG&A leverage year-over-year, and we're combined with the continued gross margin expansion, Q3 operating margin of 17.3% was up 275 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, a very strong quarter for the High-Touch Solutions business. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the US MRO market, including volume and price inflation, grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 700 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. As you heard at Investor Day last month, we're having great success gaining share as we execute against our strategic growth engine. Given our recent performance and go-forward expectations, as announced at Investor Day, we are now targeting 400 to 500 basis points of annual outgrowth going forward, a 100 basis point increase from our previous outlook target. The strength of our initiatives, coupled with our supply chain advantage, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against this commitment. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Reported and daily sales increased 8.6% or up 23.7% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for the significant impact of the depreciating Japanese yen, which is down over 23% versus last year. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 19.8% growth and Zoro US was up 27.4%. Revenue growth continues to be driven by strong new customer acquisition and repeat business for this segment as well as enterprise customer growth at MonotaRO. Gross margin expanded 130 basis points versus the third quarter of 2021 as we continue to see freight efficiencies from increased average order value. We also benefited from favorable business unit mix as Zoro grew faster than MonotaRO in the quarter. Segment operating margin declined 95 basis points in the quarter as favorable gross margins were offset by continued investments to support growth in both businesses as well as DC start-up costs at MonotaRO for the new Inagawa DC. The new facility is ramping nicely. As we exit our legacy facility in the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate that the business will return to normal operating margins thereafter. On Slide 11, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined, up 17% over the prior year period. On the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio, now at over 10.3 million SKUs. You'll see a more modest increase between the second and third quarter as Zoro -- is offering of SKUs that could not meet our service level expectations. We continue to target around 2 million SKU additions in 2022 and have a robust pipeline to meet that goal as we finish the year. Turning to guidance. With another very strong quarter and with sales in October trending up over 16% on a daily reported basis or over 21% in constant currency, we are raising our 2022 full year outlook. While we acknowledge that the broader market conditions remain uncertain and the risk of a potential recession has certainly increased, we have not seen any meaningful slowdown in our business and continue to outperform our normal seasonal trends. Our updated outlook for the full year 2022 includes: expected daily sales growth between 15.5% and 16.5% and EPS between $29.10 and $29. 70, a 48% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. This implies Q4 daily sales, which normally slowed due to seasonality, will grow roughly 9% to 13% as we face into difficult comps over the fourth quarter 2021, especially in November and December. We also continue to see further FX headwinds from the depreciation of the Japanese yen. We've included updates to our supplemental guidance as well, which can be found in the appendix. While it is not our typical practice to change guidance each quarter, doing so provides our most up-to-date expectations in light of the current economic environment. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. While this quarter brought more market fluctuation and potential uncertainty broadly, both our market and our performance was strong. I remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, deliver flawless experience, and gain share profitably over the long haul. We are grateful for our customers' continued confidence in Grainger. No matter what comes next, we will remain a trusted resource ready to help them navigate any cycle. I would also like to thank the Grainger team for all they've done and continue to do to support our customers. With our team's continued commitment to focusing on the things that matter, we are well poised to deliver a very strong finish to the year. And with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, we'll conduct our question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.
Tommy Moll: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Dee Merriwether: Good morning.
Tommy Moll: Dee, I wanted to circle back to your comments on High-Touch profit in the third quarter. You called out price/cost was a tailwind in the period, and there were some timing impacts, I think, related to discussions with suppliers, but if you could elaborate on what you were referencing there around the timing and whether that implies that it may look different next quarter or at some point in the future, that'd be helpful. Thank you.
Dee Merriwether: Thanks for the question, Tommy. So yes, we did perform well in the quarter, both top and bottom line and specifically related to the gross margin expectations. We did experience significant product mix tailwinds as well as favorable price/cost spread. And I did note that, that was due to a couple of factors: price/cost being favorably as we realize the timing benefit that we -- as we continue to work through cost negotiations with our suppliers, we do expect that benefit to normalize over the next couple of quarters. And so that really aided in some of the outperformance. In addition to that, from time to time and good hygiene, we continue to work with customers to make sure that we are receiving the value that we provide to them from an economic perspective. And so we also received some benefits in the quarter for that. We also expect that to continue.
Tommy Moll: That's helpful. Thank you, Dee. Shifting gears to capital allocation. If I'm looking at your guidance for this year correctly, I think in terms of operating cash flow, there's no update to your prior guidance, but it looks like CapEx and share repurchases have been pulled in a little bit. So I'm curious for any commentary you can give there. And then also as you think about CapEx for next year and some of the capacity expansion initiatives you talked about at Investor Day, if there's any early peak you can give us about priorities for 2023, that'd be helpful as well. Thank you.
Dee Merriwether: Sure. Yes, that is correct. We did -- based upon the range we had out there for operating cash flow less that as is. And just based upon where we were trending with share repurchases as well as we looked at what we thought will fall through CapEx by the end of the year, we made some tweaks in those numbers as well since we have the opportunity to do so. As it relates to 2025, we'll talk a little bit more about what we expect CapEx to look like in February.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. At the Investor Day, you discussed seller coverage and seller effectiveness as two of your strategic growth engines. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory there. How many outside sellers do you have today versus what you had last year? And what is the plan for 2023?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Sure. So thanks, Dave. We have -- we talked at Investor Day, based on our improved customer information, we have been able to identify a potential to add some sellers. We've added them relatively small percentages overall to a couple of pilot areas that we're running now, and we expect to have results of that early in the year, and that will inform what we do going forward. We do think we're going to have the ability to consistently add sellers and also improve the effectiveness of sellers based on the information we've now built and have on customers. And so that's a pretty exciting path. We won't have details for you in terms of what that looks like in the aggregate probably until second quarter next year when we start to hear -- get all the results back from the pilots.
David Manthey: Okay. So TBD. And then as a follow-up, could you tell us specifically when the MonotaRO occupancy expenses that are duplicate today drop off and approximately what the magnitude of that overage is right now?
D.G. Macpherson: Sure. I was over there--
Dee Merriwether: Yes.
D.G. Macpherson: I was over there four weeks ago. I'll let Dee answer the sort of exact timing. But just to give you sort of a magnitude, they're operating two buildings in the Osaka area. The new ones, a six-story enormous building that is coming up to speed and getting up to the line volumes to take over entirely, and they expect that to happen mostly by the end of the year. The other one has been running at the same time. So, that's a duplicate cost. And Dee, I'll turn it over to you for the numbers.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So just to add on what D.G. says, we expect the duplicative cost to drop off after Q1 of 2023.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning folks.
Dee Merriwether: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: I just wanted to focus in a little bit more on the outgrowth. I mean I think we've sort of transitioned here from a period of time with kind of more hyper-inflation and a little bit more scarcity supply chain-wise to what sounds like it's sort of an improving supply chain environment today just based on what some of your peers and broader industrial cohort have said. Any sort of change in the way customers or competitors are sort of interacting with the marketplace? Clearly, the background circumstances are changing. Just wondering if their needs or their priorities are changing as well?
D.G. Macpherson: I think that there's been a fairly significant increased attention to supply assuredness given what's happened in the last few years. And supply chain is improving. They've improved. They aren't fully back, but they are improving for sure, hasn't really changed those discussions. Customers still want to understand how they can make sure that they have what they need to get their jobs done. Obviously, we've always done that through different ways, whether having inventory in a branch or managing inventory on site or having next day delivery, all those things help customers. but we're still having a lot of conversations with customers about -- based on our ability to serve them during these challenging times, how can we continue to help them. And we think a lot of the performance we've had in our supply chain is going to be pretty sticky moving forward based on what we're hearing.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. And then, Dee, just a follow-up question for you on the margin tailwinds and those kind of, I'll call it, extra conversations you're having with your suppliers about that economic value, which -- it sort of sounds like a different way of saying rebate. Maybe I'm mischaracterizing it, but is that something that's on more of an annual cycle where that normalizes when the calendar flips, or what's the time line that we should think about there?
Dee Merriwether: Yes, I wouldn't think about it so much as rebates, but just we're constantly negotiating on price take timing with our supplier partners. And some of that timing, some has moved up, some has slipped out. And that's why we continually and talk about the lumpiness of GP because it's very difficult to time everything perfectly both from a price perspective and a cost actualization perspective. So, it's nothing more than that. It isn't. We really aren't focused on supplier rebates as a reason for this.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that’s helpful. And nice quarter. I'll leave it there.
Dee Merriwether: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jake Levinson with Melius Research. Please state your question.
Jake Levinson: Good morning, everyone.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Jake Levinson: D.G., if we did a postmortem, if you will, on the pandemic period over the last couple of years, do you have a sense of how many of these new customers that you picked up during COVID are still buying from you, or maybe just any color you have on kind of the retention rates?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Sure. So it's inherently tricky thing to figure out. What I would say is that our customer file has increased substantially versus 2019. So a lot of the new customers have stuck around. Our customer file was at its peak in the heart of the pandemic in 2020, both for Grainger and for Zoro and for MonotaRO. They all had sort of a similar pattern. And what was going on there was there was a lot of consumers buying and just trying to find whatever they could find for safety reasons. That's all gone back to normal. And so we think that what we see now is all of the business customers that we were able to acquire during the pandemic, either for pandemic reasons or other reasons. And we've had really healthy growth of the customer file. And I think that's probably the biggest signal that make -- that matters the most.
Jake Levinson: Okay. That's helpful. And just shifting gears on price. Are your suppliers -- I mean, certainly, you're still seeing price increases for you folks, well after that on a year-over-year basis. Are your suppliers still putting through broad-based increases, or is what we're seeing in the P&L today mostly just reflecting what's already been actioned?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So -- and Dee, you may have other adds to this. We continue to see through our cost cycle this year increases from a number of suppliers. I would say it's less intense now than it was certainly in the first half of the year. But most -- and what you're going to see in terms of price increase, a lot of it is sort of what's already been taken before. And so you're just seeing the impact of that. But we do expect some increases to continue to flow in as things continue to roll forward, but just not as intense.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to touch back on price realization. And D.G., can you give us a sense of how much of your price now is being driven by what you would call the value-based pricing as opposed to standard markup?
D.G. Macpherson: Deane, what do you -- what are you trying to understand? Go ahead. Go ahead, Dee. You can take that one.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. Deane, I want to -- first, I want to clarify, I want to make sure I understand the question. So do you want to add a little bit more color? Is there a question...
Deane Dray: It's more of a holistic question, but just give us a sense on pricing traditionally, historically with distributors was much more of a standard markup. And what you've seen is with the advent of more services being added and then understanding exactly the kind of value that Grainger is providing, you're actually able to gain more pricing and, under this umbrella, value-based pricing and wanted to get a sense of where you are in that transition. Do you feel like you've done as much as you can? Are you halfway through? Just any color there would be helpful.
Dee Merriwether: Sure. Well, I would say I think if you go back several years to the pricing strategy change to ensure that we could provide competitive pricing to all size customers, we're through that cycle. Now, we're in more of a cycle, I would say, with higher sophistication related to using our own internal information, product information and coupling that with market information to get to the best price for customers. And if it's High-Touch business, as you kind of articulated, it is making sure we get to the best price based upon the value we provide to those customers. And if it's like a midsized customer that has less -- with less services from us, price is relevant for them as well. So, I will say we are there. However, we always have opportunities with the broad assortment that we have, over 1.7 million SKUs, 2 million SKUs. Things are constantly changing. The market is changing. Costs are changing. And market price is changing. So, I will say our pricing sophistication continues to get better. From time to time, that leads to us being able to have some pricing levers in our benefit while we still remain competitive.
Deane Dray: Okay, that's helpful. And then, look, supply chain has come up a number of times. How would you characterize it in terms of product availability, lead-time, stock outs? And just also, if you could weave in if that's been the same for your private label offerings.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So, what I would say is that certainly, portions of the supply chain, I would say, are pretty much back to normal. But the portions that we control being able to pick back and shipping at things out were clean pretty much every night. A year ago, we had labor challenges and all kinds of challenges. Those have pretty much gone away in terms of our own supply chain. And then the outbound transportation is also pretty strong at this point and less of a problem. From a supplier standpoint, there's still suppliers that are catching up to challenge that they've had. And so lead-times are elongated in some cases. What I would say is that our service levels in terms of having product and being able to get to customers are high on a relative basis and getting back -- moving back towards what we'd expect to have from an absolute basis. So, we do see a lot of improvement. There's still long ways to go. I mean this is -- that was -- it's been quite a shock to the supply chain, and there's still long ways to go from our suppliers and from transportation entities. Coming from -- I think your question on global sourced product, certainly, we're seeing it become much easier to get sailings from Asia into the US, and the cost of that is coming down substantially from its peak, maybe back to where it was, but certainly coming down. And so we do see that starting to flow much better than it had earlier in the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.
Ryan Merkel: Hey everyone. I had a follow-up on gross margin. Can you help quantify the price/cost timing benefit in 3Q and just speak to sustainability into 4Q?
Dee Merriwether: Sure. Well, if you look at -- maybe if I take it to the over in the US, gross margin was up like in the 125 basis points. About half of that, I would call it the price costs of benefit and again, we see that price costs benefit normalizing as we get into 2023 or during the fourth quarter.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. That’s helpful. And then I had a follow-up on price. Really, I'm trying to get at how much price is going to carry over into 2023 just based on what you've passed through so far. And when do you lap sort of the bigger price increases that you took in 2022?
Dee Merriwether: Well, let me start 2021. Like when you look at this quarter here, it's going to be -- especially November and December, we'll be lapping 2021. That's our first, I would say, significant price inflation period. So that's why it's going to be a little bit tougher comps for us, we believe, the last two months of this year. Our rep for price, we're thinking it will be in the single -- mid-single-digits, low to mid-single-digits will -- looks like what the rent will be heading into 2023.
Ryan Merkel: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your question.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. So in the past, the company has spoken to an ability to hold North American High-Touch gross margins. So does the fact that 2022 is running a bit hotter than expected change that at all? Should we expect maybe some slight easing or normalization lower in 2023?
Dee Merriwether: Yes.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Maybe let's just talk about philosophy here, and Dee, if you want to add to it again. I think that we -- as Dee mentioned, there have been some tailwinds that are probably modest and might come back -- drop down a little bit. I think the overall algorithm hasn't changed at all. There's been a lot of messiness the last two years. Obviously, we had deflated GP given all the pandemic product and challenges with that, which was all the right things, and right things to do to serve our customers. And now you're seeing sort of the normal GP with probably a little bit of tailwinds that may bleed off. But the algorithm is still the same. We're going to -- our plan is to grow faster than the market in the High-Touch model, 400 to 500 basis points, to have consistent GP and slight SG&A leverage as we go forward. And that's the algorithm and the algorithm for the High-Touch DNS server models exactly the same as well.
Chris Snyder: Appreciate that. Thanks for all that color. And then my follow-up on that outgrowth in the US. So obviously, the company raised the target to 400 to 500 bps, and it's really substantially above kind of the pre-COVID run rate for the business. But I guess my question is, year-to-date, the outgrowth is running in the 700 or so bp range. When we think about that compression from, say, 700 down to 400 or 500, what does that reflect? Is it just maybe some level of conservatism? Is it the fact that maybe 2022 is seeing outsized pricing versus the market, or that some -- maybe some of the product availability share gains that the company has realized is going away? What's that kind of delta, that compression back? Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean it's a great question. So I think we mentioned this at Investor Day, but just to put maybe a finer point on it. When we look at what we get from a share gain perspective, we're looking at cause and effect for the actions that we take. This year is higher, obviously, than our target. And we've actually been able to determine that we think some of that might be availability-related just having product when others didn't. And some of that becomes sticky, as we've mentioned before. But when we look at the 400 to 500 basis points, that's looking at the actions and seller coverage, seller effectiveness and keep stock to drive share gain, and that's where that number comes from. So, we've had a little bit of benefit, we think, this year that's due just to having a better execution around the supply chain than maybe others have had.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. So, D.G., building off the immediately prior question for Chris, I want to kind of bridge that to the medium customer discretely. The large customer is obviously a bigger revenue base, but you have lower share there. You're doing 20% on 20%, and a lot of your capabilities do seem to be ramping as you've hit on some nice algorithms. And you have a long-term CAGR for the Endless Assortment. Should we start to think about medium customer along those lines? Can you hold the 20% with that lower share demographic?
D.G. Macpherson: What I would say is that we think we can grow midsize customers faster than large customers through the cycle. A lot of that has to do with the lower share we have, but also some of the actions we're taking are allowing us to acquire and penetrate midsized customers. Whether that's 20% or not, I won't comment on that. But I'll just -- if you recall, we were in the high 1.5 billion -- 1.8 billion number 10, 15 years ago, and we're going to break through 1.5 billion here in the next year or so, we think. And so we're getting back to where we were, but there's still long ways to go. So, we do feel comfortable that there's going to be faster outgrowth of midsized customers than there are for.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then just to revisit the gross margin algorithm. You had the 37% target in 2025 that was based on a 30% -- or a 30 basis point kind of tiny mix impact over the interim based on kind of a 37.3% this year. Should we just shift that algorithm thinking about the multiyear target?
Dee Merriwether: Are you talking about the GP mix effect?
Christopher Glynn: Yes. Using the minus 30 basis points as the driving force, and maybe you want to shift my thoughts relative to that.
Dee Merriwether: Not necessarily. I think the only thing that's probably changed on a consolidated basis is the yen continues to depreciate, but that's going to impact on the topline. The GP rate should be the same algorithm that we've discussed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question. Patrick Baumann, your line is open. Please state your question, unmute yourself.
Patrick Baumann: Can you hear me?
Operator: Yes. We got you.
Patrick Baumann: Sorry about that. So, you mentioned product mix as a favorable factor in the quarter year-over-year. Can you elaborate on that at all? I thought we'd move past kind of the pandemic versus non-pandemic stuff. So I'm just wondering what that might be now related to.
Dee Merriwether: That is true, but don't forget that the pandemic stuff that was also safety equipment, which is a significant piece of our business, and we continue to sell more safety. But the other piece is that we're also selling a whole lot more technical products. And technical product, that's also a product mix for us. And generally, those SKUs have a little bit better margin rate for us.
Patrick Baumann: I'm sorry. What are some examples of that, technical product? What is that?
Dee Merriwether: Material [ph] handling products, things that are more technical, help in manufacturing processes, pieces and parts as it relates to assembly lines and things like that are the more technical product. When we say safety product, I think a lot of people think about vest and gloves and things of that nature. So these are more products that are utilized or adjacent to manufacturing.
Patrick Baumann: Do you view that piece of the expansion that you're seeing as more sustainable? Like is that a function of like maybe some of your remerchandising efforts or anything else, or is that temporary?
Dee Merriwether: Absolutely. You hit it on the head. Our remerchandising efforts are making sure that those products are much easier for our customers to find and are helping them solve their business problems.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up is on Zoro. Can you give a sense of how fast you think that market for Endless Assortment, that, that business model is growing in the US? The Zoro growth in kind of the 27% range this quarter, obviously very strong. Just curious like how you think that market itself is growing. It's obviously taking share from, like, I think, traditional distribution. But I don't really have a good sense of how fast it's growing.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean we don't -- we think that market is growing similar to what the whole market is growing, which would be sort of low double-digits, 10% to 13% in the quarter is kind of the market growth that we saw.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I'm guessing the mix of -- heat manufacturing has grown high 20s. Light manufacturing, mid-20s. Commercial, up low 20s. Government, up mid-teens. I'm guessing that -- you talk about technical products and payable mix. I'm guessing that's what comes down to. But I do want to go back to the -- this kind of mix or temporary kind of gross margin benefit. Did you say 25 bps, Dee? Did I get that right?
Dee Merriwether: No. What were you -- you're talking about how much the price/cost one versus...
Nigel Coe: Yes. That's just the temporary supplier negotiation benefit.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. Well, I noted was the US over make year-over-year was about 125 basis points, and I said about half of that -- roughly half of that, so call it, 50 basis points – 50 so basis points is what we're saying is the price/ cost favorability that we believe will normalize heading into...
Nigel Coe: 50 basis points. Okay. So about $20 million. Okay. Got it. That makes a lot more sense. And then just thinking about your sort of APAC supply chain, we're seeing some big movements in currencies, the change yuan. So, to the extent that you still manufacture -- sorry, source white label products from China, given the move in the yuan, given the move in ocean freight rates, what kind of benefit do you realize, or does that benefit get fully captured by your suppliers?
D.G. Macpherson: So what I would say is that as we think about next year, as we think about any year, we try to think about the total cost we're going to see and the -- make sure we're pricing the market and get the best cost we can get. In many ways, those cost improvements will be embedded in price/cost because we will understand how those movements, and everybody else is going to have similar movements. The portion of product that comes from China is actually pretty similar across major competitors today. And so we don't think we are disadvantaged or advantaged necessarily on that. So we would expect that to sort of flow through in sort of normal ways from the competitive environment.
Operator: Thank you. And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: All right. Thanks for joining us today. We really appreciate you being on the call. As we said, we're certainly happy with the quarter, probably happier with sort of our longer-term ability to consistently gain share and do it in a profitable way and feel really good about the things we're doing in -- as we face into an uncertain market. I hope all of you have a great weekend and a great rest of the year and look forward to talking to you in 2023. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q2 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on our second quarter 2022 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for the respective quarterly periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from US GAAP, and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. Now, I'll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter performance and pass it to Dee to walk through the financials. Before I get to the quarter, I'd like to start with our Grainger Edge framework, which guides our strategy and behaviors across the company and with our customer and supplier partners. Over the last several years, this has been critical to our response to COVID and our efforts to gain share. Importantly, these principles that you see here for the basis of what we expect of each other. Team members have embraced these principles to build better customer solutions, focus on what matters and move faster to deliver value. They are more than words on a page. They are how we work together to support our customers and team members. One example of the Grainger Edge helping guide our efforts is around ESG. Our principles of starting with the customer investing in our success and doing the right thing, heavily influence our approach. At Grainger, we operate sustainably and with a long-term approach to critical issues. Our ESG approach, which we have reported on now for 11 years, is tightly integrated into the Grainger Edge and increasingly tied to our daily operations. In our recently published 2022 ESG report, we discussed how we are organizing our environmental, social and governance practices, as well as our four near-term priorities, which is where we believe we could make the most impact. These near-term focus areas are: diversity, equity, inclusion, making sure that Grainger is a place where each team member feels welcome and able to give their best work; energy and emissions, we continue to make great progress on improving our carbon footprint, and we have significant plans moving forward; customer sustainability solutions, helping customers reduce energy and water consumption; and finally, supplier diversity, which helps us identify and support great supplier partners to propel the business. Our team members have brought and will continue to bring these priorities into their work with our customers, helping them to achieve their ESG goals and creating even more value. As highlighted in the 2022 ESG report, we have recently worked with the state university to retrofit parking garage lighting, creating over $200,000 in annual energy savings, assisted a CPG company as they build out their supplier diversity program, and partner with a nationwide hospital system in identifying a roofing vendor to install bio-based materials on roughly 500,000 square feet of rooftop, which will reduce greenhouse emissions by 39 million pounds over a 40-year period. These are just a few examples of ESG in action, and I am incredibly proud of how our teams are continuing to live our principles each day as they work with our customers, suppliers and each other to further our efforts in this area. I hope you will take some time to review our full 2022 ESG report, which can be found on graingeresg.com. Turning now to our second quarter results. We had another strong quarter with sales growth of 19.6% or 22% on a daily constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. This included 1,000 basis points of market outgrowth in our US High-Touch business fueled by continued solid execution on our strategic initiatives and strong returns on our inventory and supply chain investments. Total company gross profit finished the quarter at 37.6%, expanding 255 basis points over the prior year second quarter. The largest driver of our expansion in the quarter was lapping the prior year pandemic-related inventory adjustment. Even when excluding that adjustment, however, we were still up around 60 basis points year-over-year with both segments contributing to the favorable results. We delivered 13.9% operating margin, an increase of 350 basis points over the prior year second quarter. This is primarily a result of the improved gross margin performance as well as our ability to continue to drive SG&A leverage on the top line growth. In the quarter, we delivered adjusted ROIC of 40.5% and a significant increase over the 29.2% generated in the second quarter of last year. We also returned $219 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. It was an excellent quarter all around. As a result of the strong performance and the continued momentum we are seeing through July, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance, which Steve will discuss in more detail And with that, I'll pass it over to Dee.
Dee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. Turning to Slide 8. We covered revenue and margins at a total company level, but I'd like to highlight a few other key points. Our total company SG&A as a percent of sales was 23.7%, a 95 basis point improvement over the prior year second quarter as we drove leverage from our top line performance. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives but remain committed to not adding unnecessary cost to the business. And our resulting EPS in the quarter was $7.19, up 68% versus the second quarter of 2021. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the second quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 22.2% compared to the second quarter of 2021. We saw broad-based double-digit growth across all geographies and over 20% growth in both midsized and large customers in the US. In the US, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth and price realization of around 11%, all helping fuel 23.1% daily sales growth. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 11.1% or 15.5% in local days in local currency. It's been a long journey, and we are proud of the traction the Canadian team has gained with their now fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. For the segment, GP margins finished the quarter at 39.7%, up 275 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by lapping of a $63 million pandemic product inventory adjustment in the prior year period. Excluding this inventory adjustment, we achieved gross margin expansion of over 25 basis points as favorable product mix and largely neutral price cost spread were partially offset by heightened freight costs. As we manage through this highly inflationary period, while there will be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to timing, our goal is to remain price competitive, while achieving price/cost neutrality. Increased SG&A spend was driven primarily by higher variable compensation expense as well as continued investments in marketing, payroll, and benefits to support growth. Even with the increased investment, we delivered 150 basis points of SG&A leverage year-over-year and when combined with strong growth margin recovery, Q2 operating margin of 15.6% was up 425 basis points versus the prior year period. Overall, the performance in our High-Touch Solutions business remains strong as our powerful value proposition continues to resonate with customers. Looking at market outgrowth on slide 10, and we estimate that the US MRO market, including both volume and price inflation, grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 1,000 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. While we know that our advantaged supply chain contributes to our success, we also continue to see strong growth with our strategic investments. We are excited about the returns that we are seeing on these investments, most notably with our remerchandising and our data-driven marketing programs. Our continued success gives us confidence in our ability to consistently achieve 300 to 400 basis points of annual market outgrowth on an ongoing basis and through the cycle. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, reported and daily sales increased 11.4%, up 21.1% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for significant impact of the depreciating Japanese yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 21.9% growth and Zoro US daily sales were up 23.2%. The segment growth continues to be driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and enterprise and repeat customer growth at MonotaRO, an impressive quarter of growth across the segment. Gross margin expanded 100 basis points versus the second quarter 2021 and was primarily driven by freight efficiencies as average order values increased at both Zoro and MonotaRO as both continue to focus on B2B customers. As planned, segment operating margin declined 25 basis points in the quarter, consistent with the first quarter. This decline was primarily a result of the new DC at MonotaRO coupled with continued investment in technology, marketing, and payroll costs to support growth at Zoro. Despite the increased investment, Zoro operating margins still improved 85 basis points over the second quarter of 2021 as strong GP -- on strong GP improvement. As a reminder, the increased cost at MonotaRO will continue for the remainder of 2022 as they transition to their new Inagala DC. We anticipate that the business will return to more normal operating margins in 2023. In addition, we also continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. On slide 12, you can see total registered users across MonotaRO and Zoro combined are up 18% over the prior year period. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro key portfolio. We are targeting about 2 million SKU additions in 2022 and will likely exceed that given our progress after the first six months. At the end of the second quarter, we have around 10.2 million active SKUs on the website. Now looking to the back half of the year. With another very strong quarter and with July total company daily sales of 19% or 21% in constant currency, we are raising our 2022 full year outlook. While we acknowledge that the broader market conditions remain uncertain, we have not seen a slowdown in demand in our business and continue to hear positive sentiment from our customers, further supporting our revised outlook. Our updated outlook for the full year 2022 includes expected daily sales growth between 14.5% and 16.5%, and EPS between $27.25 and $28.75, a 41% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We've also updated our supplemental guidance in the appendix, which reflects improved segment operating margins and net ranges for all other metrics. While it is not typical for us to change our guidance this frequently, our objective is to provide our most up-to-date view with each earnings cycle. Given the strong revenue and profitability performance to date, we felt it was necessary to update our segment metric again this quarter. With that, I will turn it back to DG for some closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. While we may not know exactly what the rest of this and next year will bring from a market perspective, I'm confident in our team's ability to execute, drive market outgrowth and invest in the areas that matter most. The time that I spent with customers this past quarter has reinforced the pride I have in the Grainger team and our ongoing commitment to remain customer-focused. I hear consistently that we have delivered to keep our customers working. As a result of our team's efforts, we have deepened customer relationships becoming the trusted partner to many. We performed extremely well in the quarter, and I am confident that we will produce a strong finish to 2022 and remain well positioned to serve our customers for the years to come. And with that, let's open the line up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.
Ryan Merkel: Thanks, good morning and very nice quarter.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Ryan.
Ryan Merkel: So I wanted to ask a question on the share gains, which have been really impressive. I guess it's a two-part question. So first, is the key driver of the share gains, the advantaged inventory that you have, or have the initiatives also maybe added a couple of hundred basis points above that 300 to 400 target?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking. Yes, the initiatives have added more than 300 to 400 basis points, we do on many of the initiatives we do A/B tests and we're able to track what the initiatives are bringing and they've been very, very effective in the last year or so. So we continue to see very strong gain from the initiatives. We are getting some tailwind from our inventory position as well. But the initiatives have been very strong in terms of their performance.
Ryan Merkel: Okay. And I guess, the follow-up is, why don't you raise the share gain target if these initiatives are adding more than the 300 to 400, is it not sustainable, or you just not have enough evidence yet?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I think more time will help us understand if this is going to be -- if we're going to get to a new norm in terms of higher share gain. Thus far, we've committed to the share gain targets and we'll continue to talk to you about what we expect going forward.
Ryan Merkel: Perfect. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.
Tommy Moll: Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Tommy Moll: I was going to ask if you'd seen any slowdown in demand and Dee beat me to the punch. So I guess I'll ask it a different way. Is there any end market or customer anecdote that's not as positive as you could even hope for at this point? Is there anything at all that's changed? I just want to circle back on that, because your comment, you haven't yet seen a slowdown. It was pretty clear at the same time, investors are searching closely for any sign of anything that's changed and there have been at least a few macro indicators that have been met.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. No, so let me just -- we're not showing experts on every segment, but I will give you some observations. And a lot of this probably has to do with what we've seen through the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic. So if you look at our segment performance in the appendix of the materials, you'll see that slower growth markets, but still growth markets are retail, which is a lot of distribution centers, typically for us, that market was way up the last couple of years. So that has certainly slowed down, but still growing. Health care and government have -- are still growing and have sort of accelerated recently again, but they were -- they're not as strong as general manufacturing, the industrial parts of the economy are certainly growing faster for us than the non-industrial parts right now. So that would be my observation. I think that's certainly consistent with what we're hearing from others as well. But I think the nice thing here is that we are seeing growth in all segments and the share gain is helping us.
Tommy Moll: Yes. That's great. Thank you. Pivoting to a question on your technology investment for high touch. D.G., you've talked for some time about some of the investments you made in the website, the product information systems, customer database, et cetera. Can you bring us up to speed on those initiatives? What inning are we in for this investment cycle? And I was going to ask -- 
D.G. Macpherson: Yes.
Tommy Moll:  -- if you could identify any of the fruit that's been borne out of these initiatives, which you've already touched on a little bit, but maybe you could give a few more examples.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. And I would say, and I'll just plug for the Analyst Day, we'll talk a little bit more about this during Analyst Day for sure. But what I would say is, the things we started earlier have proven to be very, very valuable around product information and publishing, which allows us to help -- helps our merchandising efforts and website efforts and print publications as well. And so we've seen really good results from that. We started to see really good results from the investments in customer information as well, in terms of things like improving seller coverage, improving marketing outreach, making sure we're sending the right message to the right customers. So we'll talk more in September about sort of what we have and what we plan to work on from a technology transformation, but we really like the signs we've seen so far, and we've had some very significant results.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just first a clarification for Dee on the price cost neutrality. Just -- is that on the margin basis, I trust?
Dee Merriwether: So that is on product cost. And so -- if you kind of go back, when we've talked over a period of time, we try to focus on the inflation that comes through product versus what comes through like transportation. And what we have noted is that we -- our goal over the cycle, any cycle is to be price cost neutral as it relates to our product costs, and to cover a majority of any incremental freight costs on a go-forward basis. And as you all probably know, we saw a significant acceleration of fuel pricing during the quarter. And we are working very hard to look for ways to cover some of that incremental freight costs. So it is not -- when we say price/cost neutrality, we're not talking about overall gross margin. It is a component within gross margin.
Deane Dray: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And this is more of a nuance, but you lowered the high end of the buyback guidance and this quarter, share count creep was up, and it costs you $0.03. I don't know that it's more of a nuance. But just why would you lower the buyback? And how do you feel about trying to contain share creep? Thanks.
Dee Merriwether: Yeah. So thanks for the question. And we are generally always in the market from a repurchase perspective. We're not specifically looking to attempt to try to time the market with our repurchases. And we really try to balance that with our cash generation. And so it was nothing more than Q1 and Q2, we have some large cash payouts during those periods as it relates to our bonuses, some tax payments. So it's generally just timing for us.
Deane Dray: Got it. Thanks for all the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. The high-touch gross margin has seasonality, so I get the second half operating margin guidance relative to the first half. But in Endless Assortment, the op margin looked like it averaged about 8.3% in the first half. Your guidance for the second half implies lower than that. And I'm just wondering if you can outline what are the key factors that are pressuring second half profitability relative to the first half in Endless Assortment?`
Dee Merriwether: Well, I'll start D.G. Well, generally, we're continuing as it relates to MonotaRO to ramp up our investments there and fund those investments for carrying two DCs Anegawa and Amagasaki at the same time. So those ramp costs continue to have an impact on us. And similar to the High-Touch segment, the Zoro business is continuing to invest in marketing, payroll costs, as well as technology to drive their long-term revenue growth. So it is just investments during the period of time. And as we get to 2023, specifically for MonotaRO, we expect their operating margins to normalize back to historic levels. And so we'll see some settling out at that point.
David Manthey: Okay. Thank you for that. And then second, could you outline the impact of LIFO accounting on your results? We don't talk much about that, but can you talk about sort of gross margin impact in the current quarter, the recent past, the near future?
Dee Merriwether: Sure. We generally speak to or share our LIFO impact on an annual basis. So what I will say is that with us being in an inflationary period is very important as you can imagine, to stay on top of standard cost increases with product. And so we are doing that. And so we continue to have increased cost inflation within our inventory and COGS related to LIFO, but we feel like we're fairly on top of that now that we've been in this situation for going on two -- well, I won't say two years, close to a year, a year now. So materially, in the quarter, it was a really immaterial impact, but because we continue to update our standard costs on our inventory and cover that LIFO impact with price.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please state your question.
Hans Hoffman: Hi. This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamza. On the endless assortment segment, specifically Zoro, where do you think profitability can go longer term from where we sit today and where SKU count can go? And then just what does the competitive set or competition look like for Zoro? Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean, so with Zoro, what we've talked about is we're going to pass 10 million items this year, unique SKUs. We expect profitability to get to the high single digits over the next several years. It's on a very good path to do that. And from a return on invested capital perspective, it's obviously very profitable given it doesn't have the inventory position. So profitability is getting better. It's going to continue to get better. We think we can get to probably 20 million SKUs at a minimum through Zoro over time, but that's sort of a long-term effort, probably four or five-year effort to get there, we'd expect. And yes, and so competitive set wise, it's a lot of digital players that we see, and there's a lot of them out there, but we continue to perform well and I think we can gain share consistently through that model.
Hans Hoffman: Got it. Thanks. And then could you just talk about how you're thinking about headcount additions going forward? What you're seeing in terms of labor inflation, turnover and labor availability?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So it's been a challenging labor market to say the least, over the last year or 1.5 years, I'd say. We feel like we are in a good position from a staffing perspective, particularly in areas that are so important like our distribution centers, we've been able to add significantly to our headcount. We still need to manage that effectively on an ongoing basis. And we're looking at what turnover we have, typically at the distribution center, if we -- our biggest turnover is in the first year, people come in, they don't realize the jobs as challenging as it is and may not like the job. So we do see high first year turnover once we get people through that first year, they typically stay and become long-term team members. That continues to be the dynamic, but it's been certainly challenging. We've had to hire a lot over the last couple of years, and we have a turnover in those population pools. Generally, we're very focused on making sure that we have the right staffing levels for the volume that we see and then not adding costs where it doesn't make sense in the business. So we are being careful about sort of headcount additions outside of areas that are sort of volume dependent.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.
Nigel Coe: Hi, guys. Good morning. I got a couple of clarifications and then one question on assortments. Just on the market outgrowth definition. The 12% growth in the market this quarter, is that price and volumes, or is that just volumes? Just want to make sure we're comparing like-for-like?
Dee Merriwether: Yeah. Price and volume, the 12%.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Great. That's what I thought. And then just on the price cost. So essentially, it's an invoice price. So basically, your invoice minus supplier invoice, that's how you define it?
Dee Merriwether: Well, are you talking about price inflation?
Nigel Coe: Price cost. So your definition, you said it's based on product price minus product costs. So that -- okay. Like an invoice spread basically?
Dee Merriwether: Yeah.
Nigel Coe: Yeah. Okay. Great. Just on the Endless Assortment, the growth in users is pretty consistent and pretty impressive quarter-by-quarter. Just wondering, what is the typical profile of the active users you're adding? How do you reach these users kind of acquisition cost? Any kind of help there would be helpful. And then just kind of how do you expect Zoro to perform in a recession. If these are sort of smaller users, do you expect it to be more volatile, more cyclical perhaps, or do you think that the underlying structural growth in that business can offset any pressures in a downturn?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah. So what I would say is the typical customer that we acquire is a small business customer. We have actually gotten out of some of the lower-value marketplaces where we weren't getting business users as frequently as you want. So mostly business customers and relatively small business customers. We are then really focused on getting those customers to repeat. And we've seen really nice results through MonotaRO or over the last year in terms of increasing repeat rates for existing customers. And so that's been a nice trend and a very positive trend. In terms of a downturn, we would expect the underlying growth to be able to sort of power through the downturn, we would be affected by the downturn, but we still think we'd have significant outgrowth from the Zoro model given the way the model works and what we've seen in other downturns in MonotaRO and other places.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Great first half. And curious on the second half outlook, the HTS margin guide implies a little bit of a softer sort of tail off on the margin versus normal seasonality. I know last year was bent a little differently. So looking past that, but I think the tape is usually a little more than what's implied here. So curious if you could comment on that?
Dee Merriwether: So this is, again, another year that's been difficult to forecast based upon what's going on in the marketplace. But as you know, seasonally, Q3 is a lower gross margin point for us in high-touch US. And we're planning and forecasting for that to be the case. And then we usually see a deceleration, seasonal deceleration with customers on the top line in Q4. And so we feel confident in how we have planned out and provided updated guidance for High-Touch. Nothing to read into that other than, we don't think the last couple of years are necessarily a great benchmark. And so we've gone back and looked at longer term trends to actually forecast how we believe the High-Touch US business will perform for the remainder of this year, taking into account our jumping off point from H1.
Christopher Glynn: Great. And just on this price level getting 10%, 11%, what scenarios within reason, would you see maybe price giving back and reversing a little bit, or are you pretty confident this is a new baseline?
Dee Merriwether: So what we're seeing right now is fairly steady. It's hard to see it reversing itself. And I think if you go back and look over a number of prior cycles, there -- I think there's only one instance where there may have been a true give back versus just a slowdown in price inflation, but I think time will tell.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning all.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Just a question on the inbound inflation that you're seeing, how that's progressed over the last couple of months. I think you're starting to see some of the PPI indicators plateau a little bit. Obviously, you guys are diverse across your purchases. So just wondering what that looks like in terms of what you're seeing today in the marketplace as you go out to make purchases and maybe how that's trended over the past quarter?
D.G. Macpherson: So, do you mean inbound transportation or amount product cost or all of it?
Josh Pokrzywinski: All-in, but I guess more product than transportation?
D.G. Macpherson: Okay, yeah. Yeah. So we have not -- we've seen a stabilizing of purchase prices from our suppliers. We have had fewer requests for price increases in the last several weeks than we had several months ago, for sure. But we really haven't seen any backtracking at this point. So it's stabilized, but still not -- not going down, going up slightly, going up less than it was going up.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And on the -- I guess, kind of related to that on availability, I think there's probably a point in time further back in the pandemic when there's a wider spread between what Grainger could get and maybe what some of your smaller competitors can get? How would you characterize that spread today?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, of course, we don't know exactly what our competitors can get. So this is all speculation. It's still a pretty challenging availability market. There still is certainly, the China shutdown didn't help anything and there's still areas of supply that are challenged. So I suspect we still have an advantage on some level. And I think some of the things we've done with our product information, management system has helped us get to crosses, which has been very important in the last 1.5 years to be able to cross to a functional equivalent, so we can get -- if a product is not in stock, we can actually get customer solutions. So I think we have some advantages. And I would say that we are not out of the woods from a global supply chain in our industry yet. It's going to take some while to get out of this.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Jacob Levinson: Good morning, everyone.
Dee Merriwether: Good morning.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Jacob Levinson: At the risk of beating a dead horse here on price. Certainly, the 11 points to go in the high touch business is quite a bit higher than we've seen at some of your peers. But I realize there are going to be some nuances. But if we peel back the onion, I guess the question is what's really changed the cycle that's allowing you to stay ahead of cost. Because certainly, DG, when you took over that, maybe that muscle memory wasn't there. So just curious what's happening under the hood, if you will.
D.G. Macpherson: Well, I think one thing I would say is that, it's -- there's -- the signal to noise in some cases is probably lower than you'd like, if you're looking from the outside, because some competitors are taking price at different times. And so what's changed is, we know we are market price competitive now. And we spend a lot more time focused on that. And the pricing changes we've made have been in line with market. Now we may have taken them at different times, later, earlier, depending on how things go, but we we're very confident that we are market priced at this point. And that's our primary tenant for pricing.
Jacob Levinson: Okay. That's helpful. And just changing gears a bit on Zoro, still seeing the growth accelerated over time, and that's a different tone, I guess, than what we're hearing from other e-commerce players more broadly. So, I guess, the question is, how much of this is that, you built a better mouse trap with the investments you've made over the years and the IT and the buying experience itself. Or how much of that is SKU additions or you're spending on advertising? Just trying to get a sense of what you feel like is really contributing to that success there.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I think few additions are a big part of it. I also think that the customers we're going after are business customers. And so, I think, most of what you would see as compares in the digital space would not be business focused, so we think business customers are probably doing better than consumers online right now. And so that's a big part of it too.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask about customer inventory levels. One of the concerns that investors have on the distributors is that industrial companies are reporting outsized inventory levels. Obviously, a good chunk of that is price. But I would appreciate any color or views you have on MRO inventory at your customer base?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. And just to -- I'll try to take this one. I think that the industrial manufacturers that are reporting higher inventory levels. My guess is that, most of that is actually WIP. When you visit customers now, there are many cases in which product is not MRO products. I will get to MRO product in a minute. The product generally is sitting around and you see it, and the reason it's sitting around is they don't have everything they need to actually produce. So they have strong demand, but they just can't get it out the door because they don't have everything they need to produce. And I've seen that at many, many customers that I visited in the last three or four months. I think that's the bigger issue. We don't -- our customers don't have stockpiles of MRO product. That's not the way it works. And in fact, our value proposition is to make sure they have only what they need. And so, our inventory management solutions and such, make sure that we don't have too much stock. And so -- and I'll talk with any customer, it was a backlog of MRO product. I do see supply chain-driven work in process inventory issues at a lot of manufacturers.
Chris Snyder: I appreciate that color. I guess, I wanted to follow-up for my second question on previous commentary around product availability across the industry, so at your competitors. I guess as industry-wide product availability gets better and starts to normalize. What do you think that means for your business? It sounds like some of the market outgrowth could compress back to the target range. Do you think that carries any risk of price cost, as I'd imagine maybe some of those smaller competitors will look to get back to their market share? Any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean, of course, we haven't really gone through a period driven by a pandemic like this. So any answer here is speculative. I would say that more customer visits that I'm on, our ability to keep customers going has actually led to a lot stickier relationships led to us connecting more directly from a digital perspective, led to us managing our inventory pools, we see very strong growth with our key stock. And so things that we're doing on site are really valued right now. So I'm not overly concerned that, that will be a detriment. Are we going to grow outgrowth of 1,000 basis points every quarter now or not. But we feel like we can gain share consistently and that we've built the right relationships and processes to do that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Chris Dankert: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. It looks like the operating cash flow guidance increases based principally on that better sales and profitability outlook here. But has anything changed as far as working capital requirements for expectations into the back half of the year here?
Dee Merriwether: Well, I mean, as you can kind of see our working capital needs have kind of grown with trying to ensure we have the right inventory in stock to meet demand, and to support our customer sales. And so we see that trend continuing. I will say some of the AR growth is starting to stabilize here for us a little bit. And just inside, collections are strong, so we have no issues with collecting from our customers. But it's more a matter of ensuring that we have the right inventory on a go-forward basis. We still will have strong growth, as you know, in the back half that's implied by the guidance. So no big material changes. I would just say a little bit more stability as it relates to working capital needs.
Chris Dankert: Okay. Well, I guess inventory specific we had expected some of those purchases to taper a bit or flatten out a bit. Is that kind of still the case?
Dee Merriwether: Well, I mean, based on what you just heard, D.G. say, we still -- as our customers continue to operate, they will still need MRO product. And we're building inventory on some SKUs. And on some SKUs, we still can't quite build inventory. So we will continue to attempt to get inventory back -- levels back to where we feel they need to be to meet demand.
Chris Dankert: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then I guess switching gears to analyst assortment. Is the value per order there continue to trend higher? And I guess, how does that trend on value per order compared to what kind of the internal targets are for that metric?
D.G. Macpherson: We see nice increases in average order value for the Zoro business. And I think a lot of that has to do with whom we're targeting. We're targeting only business customers. And we found ways to avoid acquiring consumers, I would say, through that process that helps average order value. We expect that to continue to get a little bit better as we continue to refine our processes and continue to get more repeat business from these business customers. But we feel like we're on a trend. It's been a little bit better than we expected actually this year from an average order value. So, probably a little better than expected, but we're basically on the path we want to be.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ken Newman: Hi, good morning.
D.G. Macpherson: Hi, good morning.
Ken Newman: I just wanted to follow-up on the comments you made earlier in the call about your retail and e-commerce sales. I think they were up mid-single-digits in the quarter, but -- can you just talk a little bit about what's embedded in the sales outlook for that portfolio? And maybe just a little bit more color on how customer behavior has changed through the quarter and into July?
Dee Merriwether: So, we really aren't changing the outlook for -- I believe you're talking about our Endless Assortment segment?
D.G. Macpherson: No, no, I got it.
Dee Merriwether: Okay.
D.G. Macpherson: So, you're talking about our retail segment within Grainger. Just to make sure you understand what that is, that is a lot of distribution centers, some is e-commerce some is not. So, we do a lot of work with big retailers that are that are traditional as well in terms of helping them. We don't -- we expect that segment to grow slower the rest of the year versus other segments for sure. We don't typically give out sort of segment-level growth guidance, but we certainly are seeing trends that everybody is seeing. And again, I think there's -- the single noise there is probably not that as strong as it might otherwise be because what we saw during the pandemic was those channels explode. And so a lot of our growth was in retail, government, healthcare and now that's reversed because the compares are so high. So, I don't think it's like activity is not strong, it is. It's just not growing as fast as some of the other segments are.
Ken Newman: Understood. So, it’s a deceleration rather than a true year-over-year decline with that customer mix. Is that fair?
D.G. Macpherson: Correct.
Ken Newman: And then for my follow-up, I know there's been a lot of questions on pricing this call. Just again, can you just help me what are the expectations for pricing momentum in the second half within High-Touch, I think we are closer to pricing peaking here within the second half or how we already approached that.
Dee Merriwether: So, as we go through the Q3, I kind of noted it ends up being low point for GM for us. We're looking at continuing to pass on any inflation that we may see. We have another opportunity to potentially do that within the third quarter, but it will be nowhere as meaningful as like our first quarter increases have been. So, we're looking to -- from a full year perspective for price to end around 9% to 10% range, and we're a little bit higher than that now. And so we're just looking to end the year, price cost neutral which is our overall goal. And so -- and as D.G. noted, while remaining price competitive.
D.G. Macpherson: And the other thing I would say there to add to what Dee said is that the slowdown in inflation in the second half isn't really -- it's not resetting prices or lowering prices. It's basically the comparisons, because we started taking inflation last year in the back half of the year. So it's basically just on the compares to last year, that's the reason.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Patrick Baumann: Hi. The math on the guide suggests you expect SG&A to level off in the second half of the year versus what you just reported in the second quarter around $900 million. Maybe my math is off, but that's kind of what I was coming to? It looks like in prior years, those costs can increase second half versus the second quarter. So the question is, if my math is right, which might be wrong, you could just tell me it's wrong. If it's right, though, what causes those costs to be flat sequentially this year?
Dee Merriwether: So I think it's just timing of our investments. And so earlier this year, like in most years, we have our variable comp payout, and this year based upon performance, we were able to accrue some of those expenses based upon how we were running in H1 and settled out in line with our guidance and our forecast. So we don't see a lot of incrementality in the second half from that perspective. And we're continuing to invest at a more steady rate. And again, as D.G. noted, we started some of those investments a little hotter last year in the second quarter. So we're comping some of that year-over-year from an SG&A perspective. But the numbers are right.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. So my math is right. Got it. Helpful color. And then Dee, also in the past, you've been more specific on month-to-date trends, when you report the quarter. Is there any way to put a finer point on July when you say that there's no slowdown in demand – can I take that to mean that July sales are still running 20% plus at constant currency?
Dee Merriwether: Yes. We noted that, yeah.
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah. It is in the script. I think you said, we're running close to 21% on a constant currency basis.
Dee Merriwether: Currency basis. That's correct.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: All right. Well, thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to have you on. I hope you all get to enjoy the rest of your summer. As a quick reminder, we are hosting our Investor Day on Wednesday, September 21. We hope you can join us in person, if possible, at our Northeast Distribution Center in New Jersey or virtually. We really look forward to spending time with you there. And again, thanks for the time, and take care.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Kyle Bland, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me are DG MacPherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures, are found in the table at the end of this presentation and in our Q1 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on our first quarter 2022 results, which are consistent on both the reported and adjusted basis for all periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP, and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. Now, I'll turn it over to DG.
Don Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter performance, and then pass it to Dee to walk through the financials in detail. I'll begin by quickly highlighting our strategic operating framework, the Grainger Edge. I am proud of our team members as we embrace the edge at every level of the organization and in everything we do day in and day out. This framework serves as the basis for our culture and define how we work together to serve our customers and communities. I'm excited to share that earlier this month, we were recognized as one of Fortune 100's -- Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. This award is attributed to team members across the organization. Turning to Slide 5. Not unlike the past 2 years, the first quarter of 2022 threw us some challenges, including the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, heightened inflationary pressures, supply chain and labor challenges and now the Russian war in Ukraine. I'd like to spend a few minutes on how we are managing through these challenges. First, we continue to manage through the highest inflationary period in our careers. On the cost side, we are leveraging our purchasing scale and working closely with our supplier partners to chart a shared path forward. Despite high inflation, our goal remains to be price competitive while targeting price/cost neutrality. On the supply chain front, we continue to work with our supplier and transportation partners to ensure products are available and delivered to customers on a timely basis. U.S. customer service levels are starting to improve as carrier capacity increases. Overseas freight remains pressured with delays, port congestion and container challenges and when coupled with increasing fuel prices, is pushing costs higher than historical trends. We expect these costs to remain elevated throughout the year. We remain focused on securing product for our customers as we navigate through the continued product shortages and delays. We expect the ongoing COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai and broader China will further challenge supply chains over the coming months. We have been increasing our inventory position since the middle of last year to maintain service levels and continue to monitor developments to stay ahead of the game. In my visits to our customers in Q1, I continue to hear that we are performing well, relative to the market, on securing product. We also continue to stay focused on hiring and maintaining competitive payroll and benefits to ensure we attract, engage and retain high-performing teams. This is especially important for customer-facing and support roles within our distribution and contact centers. We continue to receive feedback that Grainger is a great place to work, and our team members still value as they work to support our customers each day. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives like marketing, remerchandising, KeepStock and technology. These efforts, coupled with our advantaged service, have allowed Grainger to have strong outgrowth versus the broader MRO market. Switching gears to our financials. Demand remained robust, and we finished the quarter with sales growth of 18.2% or 17.9% on a daily constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. High-Touch Solutions North America had exceptional daily sales growth of 18.2%. In the U.S., we outgrew the broader MRO market by 550 basis points for the quarter as our supply chain and inventory investments helped us meet our customers' needs. Total company gross profit margin finished the quarter at 37.9%, expanding 245 basis points over the prior-year first quarter. The largest component of our expansion over the prior year was lacking the pandemic-related inventory adjustment that we took in the first quarter of 2021. Even when excluding that adjustment, however, we were still up nicely year-over-year. We delivered 14.6% operating margin, an increase of 305 basis points over the prior year as the improved gross margin performance was further aided by top-line leverage and disciplined cost management. In the quarter, we delivered an adjusted ROIC of 41% and returned $163 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Yesterday, we announced an increase in our dividend, which marks our 51st year of consistent increases and continued commitment to our shareholders. As a result of our strong performance, we are raising our full-year 2022 guidance estimates. I continue to be impressed with how our team has come together to deliver such great results. Earlier this year, we talked about our focus areas for 2022, executing on our key growth initiatives, driving operational excellence and strengthening our culture. We've made strong progress in all 3 areas and continue to build the company for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter and our guidance. Dee?
Dee Merriwether: Thanks, DG. I'd like to echo DG's sentiments. Our execution and teamwork in the first quarter drove very strong results. Turning to Slide 8. We covered revenue and margins at the total company level, and I'll get into more detail on the segments in a minute. Before we do, I'd like to highlight a few other key points. Our total company SG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.3%, gaining solid leverage over the prior-period first quarter. Given our investments in the DCs at MonotaRO and our continued strategic initiatives in High-Touch Solutions, I am proud of the way the team concurrently managed these investments as well as operating expenses to support strong top-line performance in the quarter. Finally, resulting EPS in the quarter was $7.07, up 58% versus the first quarter of 2021. Turning now to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the first quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 18.2%, compared to the first quarter of 2021. We saw impressive growth across the board with double-digit revenue growth across all of our North American geographies and both large and midsize customers. In the U.S., we saw a strong price realization from our recent pricing actions and delivered strong growth in every end market, with particular strength in commercial, transportation and heavy manufacturing. In Canada, the economy has rallied back, and the business saw year-over-year sales growth in nearly every end market, with manufacturing especially strong this quarter. Canadian daily sales were up 10% or 11.8% in local days and local currency. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 40.4%, up 310 basis points versus the prior year. If we exclude the first quarter 2021 pandemic product inventory adjustment, we still achieved gross margin expansion of roughly 80 basis points. This expansion was largely driven by favorable product mix and also aided by the return of the in-person Grainger Show in February. While the sale provided a modest tailwind in the quarter, it is expected to net out as we move through the balance of the year. Given the timing of price and cost increases in the quarter, our price/cost spread was favorable. However, when netted against increased freight costs, it was largely neutral. I'll also note that our pandemic mix at the end of the quarter was back to near prepandemic levels at just above 20% of sales mix, and we continue to see similar results through the first few weeks of April. While we have included our pandemic-related sales in the appendix for this period, given that we have returned to prepandemic mix levels, we do not expect to provide this information in subsequent quarters. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 395 basis points year-over-year as the strong gross margin recovery was aided by 85 basis points of operational expense leverage. Overall, an extremely solid quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 550 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. As I've gone out and spent time with customers and investors over the last few months, we often are asked about the drivers of our share gain. We know our supply chain scale and our ability to deliver products to customers has been strong. We also know that by focusing on and investing in the right areas like remerchandising our assortment, increasing our use of analytically-driven marketing and improving the effectiveness of our salesforce, we can consistently deliver growth above the market. We continue to execute well, and our goal to achieve 300 to 400 basis points of annual market outgrowth remains intact. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 12.1% or 10.4% on a daily basis. Results were heavily impacted by foreign exchange, given the depreciation of the Japanese yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 18.4% growth, whereas Zoro U.S. daily sales were up over 19%, both very strong. Growth continues to be driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and MonotaRO's continued success with enterprise customers. GP expanded 10 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, while operating margins declined 95 basis points as planned. This decline was primarily a result of our increased DC investments at MonotaRO and was partially offset by Zoro's operating margin expansion, which improved 90 basis points over the first quarter of 2021 on strong GP improvement. Please note the slide covering channel-specific performance for Zoro and MonotaRO is included in the appendix. In addition, we've also continued to see positive results in our key operating metrics. On Slide 12, you can see registered users are up 20% over the prior period. You'll see the count of registered users for Zoro has been restated for prior reporting. In 2021, Zoro made a strategic pivot away from certain less productive channels, allowing them to focus on more profitable B2B customers, who also have a higher likelihood to make repeat purchases. These all drives higher lifetime-value customers to Zoro. As a result, we've elected to remove these customers from this metric, which lowers the nominal user count for Zoro, but the growth rate remains relatively consistent to what we have shown in the past. We think this is a more accurate way to reflect this metric, and we will use this new definition, going forward. On the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio. We are targeting around 2 million SKU additions again in 2022 and are off to a good start as we continue to onboard more strategic third-party partner -- supplier partners. Now looking forward to the rest of the year. We're off to a great start and results remained strong in April, with total company daily sales trending up around 20%. While we don't typically adjust our guidance expectations after a quarter and acknowledge the broad market uncertainty, our conversations with customers' results to date and continued momentum give us confidence to make a change at this time. As a result, we are raising our 2022 full-year guidance. Our new outlook includes expected daily sales growth between 11% and 14% and EPS between $25 and $27, representing over 30% earnings growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We've also updated our supplemental guidance in the appendix, which reflects a slight upward revision in the High-Touch Solutions operating margin and an increase in total company operating cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to DG for some closing remarks.
Don Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. First, we performed extremely well in the quarter. I'm proud of the team and the way we've executed, focused on serving customers well and navigated through some of the bigger challenges that we discussed at the beginning of the call. We continue to execute on our growth drivers, drive operational excellence and strengthen our culture. We are well positioned to continue serving customers well and they have a very strong 2022. As we shared last quarter, I'm excited to provide some information on our upcoming Investor Day. We will be hosting it on Wednesday, September 21 at our Northeast distribution center in Bordentown, New Jersey. We will be focused on providing more details on our strategic initiatives and longer-term outlook, as well as provide a tour of our DC, where we will highlight some of our automation and ESG investments at work. More detailed information will be available in the coming weeks, and we certainly look forward to an exciting day. With that, we will open up the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jake Levinson from Melius Research.
Jake Levinson: I just wanted to see if we could get a little bit more color on what's happening with our neighbors in the North. I know you folks used to break that out a little bit separately, but maybe you can just give us an update on how things are progressing in Canada. It seems like the end markets have finally turned in your favor, but are we kind of on the sustainable path to profitability there?
Don Macpherson: Yes, yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking. So I think the business is on a very sustainable path to profitability. We have reset the way the business operates over the last 3 or 4 years. We're seeing signs of share gain returning into that business. The cost structure is in a good place, and we're seeing growth with some attractive customer segments, most notably manufacturing in healthcare. And that business just continues to get better and better, from a profitability perspective, and it's steady, and it's going to continue to be a steady rise in profitability, but we feel pretty good about the path we're on.
Jake Levinson: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a quick follow-up, I'm looking at the safety side of the business. You mentioned that, that's back to kind of prepandemic levels as a percent of sales. I guess the question is, what does the new normal look like for your customers, in terms of buying those products? Obviously, the mandates seem to be changing or social norms around mask-wearing and what not, so are your customers still buying masks and hand sanitizer and things like that at elevated rates, I guess, you could say?
Don Macpherson: Yes. I think Dee talked about it. We're pretty much back to prepandemic mix. I'd say, there's a slight elevation in some of those products. I can't really predict what customer behavior is going to be around those products, given the way the virus proceeds. But what I will say is that we see most customers going back to some normalcy. I've been in a number of manufacturing plants the last couple of weeks. And in almost all cases, there isn't a lot of new PPE versus what was borne in 2019 being used. So we don't expect it to be hugely elevated, mask and sanitizer sales, going forward. And we're pretty much back to normal, still elevated, but not that much.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Ryan Merkel from William Blair.
Ryan Merkel: First off, I was hoping you could unpack the comment you made about speaking with customers and they expressed a lot of confidence about demand. In particular, I'm curious if you spoke with energy customers, if they're seeing a big uplift here?
Don Macpherson: I can give you my perspective and Dee, if you've talked to customers that have a different perspective. I have not talked to all that many energy customers. I have talked to a lot of heavy manufacturing, line manufacturing commercial customers. And despite -- we talked about -- a little bit about it despite sort of the uncertainty of the world, everybody right now would say super busy, just hanging on. If I can get the supply chain parts into my operation, I have the demand, and we see that through most of the customers that we're talking to, right now. So a lot of positivity. I haven't been -- I'm trying to think, it's been a while since I've been in an energy plant. So I don't have that perspective. But generally, customers are pretty bullish on demand, right now.
Dee Merriwether: I was just going to concur. My time with customers is similar to DG's experience up to this point in the year.
Ryan Merkel: All right. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, what really stood out to me was the profit margin in the High-Touch business. And I'm curious, the guidance seems to imply that 1Q will be the high watermark. So can you just unpack why that might be the case?
Don Macpherson: Sure. Dee, do you want to take that one?
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So when we talked about guidance last year, I think a lot of the underlying assumptions really stick, even with some strong performance up to this point. We, of course, had to lap for the E&O adjustments. The first quarter is the time when we work with our suppliers on some of our largest price increases in line with our cost cycle that we work with them. I know the cost cycle has been a little unusual, but I will say, the seasonality related to our price changes, we are assuming the same types of outcomes. So you are exactly right. We feel like Q1 will be a higher watermark as it relates to that, and we will moderate as we go through the year. Again, some of the tenants are the same. We're still focusing on price/cost neutrality and remaining price competitive in this market.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: So I wanted to just return to Canada. That business, in days gone by, it was tracking low double digits until the oil and gas bubble burst in 2014, but any reason why it can't get back to those kinds of levels? I mean there's been some changes in the business profile and the cost base. So just curious on that. And then on the midsized customer margins, they used to be running, I think, about 10 points above the average in that segment. Are they still in that kind of zone?
Don Macpherson: I think, Nigel, your question on Canada is revenue growth, can we get back to sort of double-digit revenue growth, is that your question?
Nigel Coe: No, no, no. Margins, margins.
Don Macpherson: Oh, margins, yes. Yes. Structurally, we don't think there's any reason why we can't get there. Given the path of the business, we're focused on sequential improvement, and we do feel like we can build to that, but it's going to take multiple years to get back to that 10%. They're going on a good path. I am very confident that we will continue to improve margins in Canada. But structurally, there's no reason why we can't get back to double-digit margins there. And then Dee, do you want to take the second half of that?
Dee Merriwether: Yes. Yes. And on midsized customers, I think it's a good assumption now to use high single-digit number.
Nigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then just April, any comments on how April has been tracking relative to the strength to the 1Q?
Don Macpherson: Very well. It's -- Dee mentioned that it's 20%. It's, if anything, it's been slightly better than what we saw for 1Q revenue in April. But generally, it's very, very good.
Operator: Our next question is coming from David Manthey from Baird.
David Manthey: And congrats on the Fortune designation. It's a great honor. Could you please update us on High-Touch and some of your efforts there? I mean you had really nice outgrowth, and I'm trying to understand the factors there. I'm sure it's a combination of these things. But if you could talk about customer receptivity? And then, any idiosyncratic things that are going on there, in terms of a better offering or changes in incentives, anything that you're doing inside Grainger to drive those better results?
Don Macpherson: Yes. And we've talked about some of these things before. The primary initiatives for us are around continuing to improve our product assortment through merchandising efforts and making it easy for customers to find what they need. We continue to make great progress there. We see cause and effect in terms of driving share gain through that effort. Our marketing efforts, we're getting more capable in terms of marketing, spending money in the right places and getting really strong returns out of marketing, and that's a big piece of it. We see a nice expansion of our KeepStock offer, so becoming more integrated with our customers' inventory management practices and supporting their inventory management practices. Those are things that have been very consistent and are a bit evergreen for us at this point, in the sense that we're always getting better at those and we -- those -- cause actually drive significant share gain. I don't think there's really anything even idiosyncratic. I think the core thing that we are working on, I would add providing better insights to our customers to help them manage their business, they cost out, and I think we're getting better and better at that as well. But the only idiosyncratic thing would probably be supply chain related. I think, through this time, we've done a better job than most of managing, adding product of finding customers' substitute products, if we don't have products, and being able to serve them. And so we're probably getting some -- it's hard to quantify from just having inventory and being able to serve customers where others cannot.
David Manthey: Got it. That sounds good. And then just quickly, if you could zoom out on gross margin kind of 5-year plus sort of basis. Do you expect gross margin to continue to decline gradually over time, all else equal?
Don Macpherson: Yes, go ahead, Dee. You can take that.
Dee Merriwether: I was going to add that -- DG, you can continue on. In the High-Touch business, we've kind of noted, specifically for this year, that we're focusing on gross margin stability around 40%. And DG, were you going to talk about the outlook?
Don Macpherson: Yes. Yes. I mean -- so what I would say is, we feel like we are price competitive at the gross margins we're at. We feel like within the High-Touch, the 40% number is going to be a fairly stable number over time. Our company gross margins are likely to go down slightly, just given the assortment growth continues to be -- to grow faster than the business, and then they tend to operate at a lower gross margin and lower SG&A. But in terms of the segment performance, we actually expect pretty stable gross margins over the next several years.
Operator: Your next question today is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.
JoshPokrzywinski: Just first question, I guess, a clarification. Dee, you mentioned, I think, in some of your opening remarks about kind of a seasonal benefit in 1Q kind of tied into a sales event in February, I just -- starting to unpack -- hoping to unpack that a little bit more and maybe add some numbers to it.
Dee Merriwether: Well, sure. Yes. We returned to an in-person Grainger show in Orlando in February. That's what I meant in my prepared remarks related to a show. It was really great to be back in person. Our show was well attended. We heard great feedback from our customers and from our team members. From a Q1 GP perspective, the show provides a modest tailwind for us year-over-year. And that's due to supplier funding, as you can imagine. And this favorable impact through the year will moderate versus prior year as we will go through the year.
JoshPokrzywinski: Okay. Got it.
Dee Merriwether: Verified [ph].
JoshPokrzywinski: Understood. And then a competitor of yours, pretty recently, talked about some supply chain stabilization, maybe not seeing as much inbound inflation outside of freight-related items. What would the Grainger take on that be? I mean, obviously, the freight environment has gotten more difficult, and China has a bit more of wild COVID lockdowns. But would that be your take as well? Or do you see that differently?
Don Macpherson: We certainly have seen some improvement in -- particularly, domestic freight, in terms of service. And price increases have certainly moderated. They were starting to moderate a little bit on ocean freight as well with the lockdown in China. You know how that's going to play out. But yes, we would say something similar, where things were easing a little bit and continue to do that domestically, the overseas piece is probably the more complicated .
Operator: And your next question is coming from Chris Snyder from UBS.
Chris Snyder: I guess, so first, I kind of wanted to follow up on DG's prior commentary around the longer-term gross margin drivers. And certainly, I understand that Endless Assortment outgrowth is a structural gross margin, I don't have the consolidated level. But what gives the company confidence that it can hold business line, gross margin steady beyond '22? This is a pretty competitive business. So it is the midsized outgrowth. What gives you on that?
Don Macpherson: Yes. I think, just working with our customers, understanding the value we provide, the value we create, seeing some midsized outgrowth and having confidence as we continue to return to more industrial product as we've seen. We just feel like our price is in a competitive place. And we can continue to support our customers and provide what they need and sell on the value that we provide. And that's really what our business is based on. And we're going to continue to do that.
Chris Snyder: All right. And then I wanted to also follow up on the last question and commentary around potentially maybe easing some of the domestic freight costs or supply chain, and I understand that part of it. But has supply chains overall eased? Or has procurement gotten more difficult with the China shutdowns, even at -- some of the domestic freight market has opened up a little bit?
Don Macpherson: Yes. So I would first comment that the China shutdown is going to take weeks and maybe longer for that to flow through, in terms of understanding the impact. I would say that ex that, what we were seeing before was still significant supply chain challenges but more isolated to specific suppliers that were having trouble getting product to meet their manufacturing needs. And so it wasn't as widespread as transportation improved. And we do buy a lot domestically as well. And so for customers that have the materials that we haven't seen, labor has gotten a little bit better and transportation got a little bit better. There's still plenty of pockets of challenges though. And we still see -- it's still a challenged supply chain, from our suppliers' perspective, in many cases, but it is more isolated to specific suppliers rather than -- it was broad-based this time last year. You would have just said, it was kind of chaos, and it's less chaos now, but there's still plenty of challenges.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.
Hans Hoffman: This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamzah Mazari. My first question is just on the cyclicality of the portfolio today. Can you just walk us through how to think about how your business performed in a recession? And maybe any differences in the mix of the portfolio today versus past downturns?
Don Macpherson: You're talking about if there's a recession, how have we performed in past recessions? Is that your question?
Hans Hoffman: Yes. Yes, yes. If there's any difference in the mix of the portfolio today versus past downturns.
Don Macpherson: I don't think -- so to answer the second part first, I don't think there's a significant change in the mix of the portfolio. We have more on those assortment business, but I don't -- that will probably perform similarly. The short answer is, we generally perform well in downturns. We look at share gain during downturns, and it's usually been very good. Part of that is because we are steadfast in maintaining service to customers in downturns, and that allows us to serve customers better than many others can. And we generally still generate a whole bunch of cash during downturns and still perform well. Obviously, everybody takes a hit. We take a financial -- you can go back and look at 2008, '09, is probably the most severe one we've had, and you can model what happened there. But we're -- one of the things that I would sort of say is, we are -- while we don't know when a recession will hit, we are certainly aware of the uncertainties of the world and we are being very mindful of the cost of running the business. So we are prepared for anything that happens. But in general, we performed well, and we would expect to do that again.
Hans Hoffman: Great. And then, could you just walk us through where your market share is today with midsized customers? And what the total addressable market there is?
Don Macpherson: Yes. So -- and Dee, do you want to -- you may have the details. Roughly, if you go back over a kind of 10-, 12-year period, we were at about $2 billion of midsized customers. We dropped below $1 billion. We're now, I think, $1.5 billion or more, $1.6 billion, maybe this year, something like that, is the expectation. We're still to and change market share with midsized customers. We feel like we've got a long road ahead. And we continue to do a really nice job of reacquiring customers that left us, and then growing with existing customers and building solid relationships. So we think we've got a long runway, in terms of share gain, with midsized customers.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: But DG, I was hoping you could expand on what types of products are in short supply? Did you have any missed sales because you would blame it on the supply chain?
Don Macpherson: No, I wouldn't say we had many missed sales. We have -- I mentioned this a little bit before, more than ever, probably we're relying on some of our product information investments to make sure we can get customers to substitutes. But we wouldn't have any sort of things that wouldn't be in the news already. Obviously, if a product has a chip in it, that's been a challenge. There are certain commodity products that have been challenged. So I won't call out specific products, but I would say, we've done a nice job of finding alternatives in most cases, and it's hard to argue that we're missing too many sales. I'm sure we are missing some sales and they're just not occurring because nobody has those products.
Deane Dray: That's helpful. And then just qualitatively, can you comment on the mix with regard to a typical reopening? Coming out of the pandemic, you've got a number of your customers opening up shop, back to work. And so that's when Grainger typically gets a nice lift as they haven't restocked their shelves but now they have to. So you typically get a bigger lift during the, like reopening or restarting process. Is that still reading across in your North America businesses? Or is this kind of the steady MRO run rate?
Don Macpherson: This is -- first of all, we have not had many customers that closed shop. I mean, we've been with our customers throughout. There were a few in certain categories that shut down. So if you said cruise lines, which we have cruise line customers, obviously, they shut down. And you'd see a little bit of that type of growth potentially there, but it's a very small portion. Hospitals, governments, manufacturing plants, retail organizations in terms of distribution centers have all been open the whole time. So one of the things that's been maybe surprising through the pandemic is just how consistent the growth has been. If you go back to 2019, we've seen substantial growth, and we saw really growth only in the front end of the pandemic in 2022 that we really see a drop because most customers actually kept operating. And so, I think it's just normal business. We don't see much restocking going on.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Chris Dankert from Loop Capital.
Chris Dankert: I guess, and forgive me if I've missed it, but can we get a little bit more detail on the Zoro strategic pivot? I mean, it sounds like you're moving more into productive channels. I mean, does this merely change the TAM? Does it change the growth outlook for that business? Was it a margin-driven decision? Any color on that strategy change would be great.
Don Macpherson: Yes. We've been making a strategic pivot with that business for the last several years, dramatically expanding the product line, building new data analytics capabilities, getting that business independent from a technology stack. So there's been a lot of investment that's happened. In terms of the question specifically you're asking, we have done a whole bunch of analysis, working with the team in Japan, on customer profitability. And customer profitability, not in terms of the first transaction but in terms of lifetime value. And we are skewing our efforts to attractive business customers. And so what you've seen is dropped some volume that we certainly could have in the short term because it's just not helpful in terms of creating a profitable long-term business. I think, ultimately, it actually will accelerate our growth rate as we get better at acquiring and getting attractive customers to the second, third order, where they become more frequent buyers. But certainly, we have made a little bit of a shift in getting out of some channels that were lower lifetime.
Chris Dankert: Got it. That's really, really helpful. I guess, kind of, with that as a backdrop, any kind of color you're able to provide in terms of kind of price versus volume inside of the Zoro business this quarter?
Don Macpherson: I think the price volume wasn't much different than what we saw in the whole business that we talked about before. So high single-digit price and substantial volume growth is what we're seeing in that business at this point.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: So I appreciate the comments that reopening isn't causing really episodic demand that you can really think of. But I think Dee maybe referred to some idiosyncratic benefit from competitors that are in relatively less supply chain wherewithal than you getting product through. I think, historically, when you accrue volumes in customers, it's pretty sticky base for continued scaling. So I just wanted to kind of revisit that there might be some reversion, once everyone has sort of democratic access to process or to procurement. But yes, just -- I'll listen from there.
Don Macpherson: Yes. It's a great question. I think what I'm hearing from customers is, most of the work that we've done has been highly valued to support their operations and to keep them up and running. And in many cases, we've actually added inventory management solutions to our KeepStock solutions or further embedded in customers really, really want to continue to have long-term relationships. So you could argue there may be some pullback, but that's really not the behavior we're seeing, and it's not what we're hearing from our customers. Our customers are saying, if anything, we've learned a whole lot about who we want to partner with and why we want to partner with them through this. And our ability to keep customers going is super valued, and I think it will continue to help us be sticky with those customers.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Patrick Baumann from JPMorgan.
Patrick Baumann: Can you talk about the approach to pricing this year? Should we assume the 8% in the first quarter is a good level to work from now? Or have you taken more actions that are providing another boost here in April and for the rest of the year?
Don Macpherson: Yes. Dee, why don't you -- do you want to jump in? I can not hear you, Dee. I can take it then. So what we basically have been looking at is, we took price, obviously, through some of the back half of last year as well, as everybody has. We think prices will moderate a bit. So we don't think the level we're at will be the full-year number year-over-year because we think that the price increases will moderate. That doesn't mean prices will go down, they won't. But relative to some of the changes that we made last year, you'll start to see a bit slower -- a lower difference. So we would expect them to moderate somewhat, still a pretty healthy price, obviously, this year.
Patrick Baumann: Got it. And then with all this -- oh, sorry, Dee, go ahead.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. Sorry, I don't know, there was a problem with my line, I apologize for that. Yes, we -- in High-Touch U.S., I know specifically, we usually talk a little bit about our pricing outlook. And so we're expecting price to be about 6 to 7 for the year.
Patrick Baumann: Helpful. And then with all the pricing and the positive price/cost in the first quarter, just curious, why you aren't able to increase the gross margin guide? Can you just talk about the puts and takes there? And whether you may see some benefit if cost inflation moderates, given that the LIFO accounting dynamic you mentioned last quarter?
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So we've kind of usually talked about the lumpiness of price for us and how it impacts gross margin through the year, with a large portion of our High-Touch U.S. business being contract based. So in light of still saying suppliers continue to come in, with cost inflation request and our ability to continue to work with them on that, when we look at the outlook, we believe that staying in line with our current gross margin is most feasible right now, knowing that we're going to have some lumpiness as we continue to appropriately pass through some inflation as it comes through off-cycle. As the year progresses, as you know, the math works, you have less months to push some of that through.
Operator: We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to DG for any further closing comments.
Don Macpherson: Sure. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It is a pleasure to have you on and hope you're all doing well. I would just reiterate the fact that we're completely focused on what we can control, and that's making sure we advance our strategic initiatives to grow profitably. Building the culture, we think, is really, really important and making sure that we serve our customers well. And while there are many things going on, the market right now is very, very strong, and we feel good about the share gain performance we're getting. We feel good about what we're seeing in both models. And really optimistic for the future. So thanks. I hope you all have a great rest of the week, and take care.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.
Irene Holman: Good morning, and welcome to Grainger’s fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q4 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning’s call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our release. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP, and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO’s public statements. Now, I’ll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I’m going to provide an overview of our full year highlights and fourth quarter results, and I’ll begin, as we always do, with the Grainger Edge, our strategic framework that defines who we are, why we exist and where we’re going, as well as how we’ll get there using our operating principles. This framework has been foundational for our team to work through another challenging year with resilience and strength. We remain relentlessly focused on our customers and building the company for the future. I am tremendously proud of what we’ve achieved and want to thank our team members for their commitment as well as our suppliers and transportation partners for their shared passion to support our customers throughout the year. It is always a privilege to help customers keep their people safe and their operations running, and even more so over the last two years. While 2021 was our second year navigating the impacts of the pandemic, it certainly brought us some unique challenges. Labor material shortages train supply chains throughout the industry. We demonstrated our agility and leveraged our supply chain scale to deliver strong service. Our customer satisfaction remained high. And in my regular interactions with customers, I continue to hear appreciation for our ability to deliver over the last two years. We invested in inventory, which enabled us to improve our availability and meet growing demand, especially in the back half of the year. We’ve also invested in our team members with increased wages to make sure that our DCs are staffed and able to get orders out the door. I can confidently say that the Grainger team navigated these challenges extremely well and put us in a good position as we enter 2022. While we continue to focus on customers’ needs, I’m pleased with the team’s progress on our strategic initiatives that we know drive short and long-term growth. Our merchandising team reviewed $1.5 billion of the assortment last year, continuing to make it easier for customers to navigate our website and find the products they need quickly. That brings our total re-merchandise assortment to $4.4 billion, which helps our customers choose products with confidence. We’ve also increased our marketing investments, especially in areas like paid search, digital and radio ads, which have driven share gain and improved our brand recognition. We’re excited by these results and the traction we’ve gained with both large and midsized customers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our KeepStock teams have served customers on site, supporting their inventory management needs and offering valuable insights to help them save time and money. This, in conjunction with our e-procurement services has continued to make it easier for customers to do business with Grainger. Around 60% of U.S. revenue now comes from customers with multiple solutions that embed us in their operations. Our technology investments have been critical in supporting these efforts. Over the last two years, we’ve developed new product information, publishing, customer information and marketing support systems. We continue to improve our technology capabilities to help us win in the market. Our endless assortment segment continues to grow as we made progress on our strategic initiatives. Zoro U.S. achieved its full year SKU count goal, adding over 2.5 million schools this year alone, which brings a total assortment to 8.7 million SKUs. We’ve expanded to new customer segments and new categories driving both new and repeat business. And in 2021, MonotaRO opened the Ibaraki DC in Japan, allowing them to stock high demand items locally with plans for another DC [indiscernible] Japan in 2022. And finally, we are making strong progress on ESG. 2022 will be our 11th year publishing a corporate responsibility report. We’ve elevated its importance in our organization through our ESG leadership council, which I chair. In 2021, we reviewed and updated our materiality metrics to ensure our ESG priorities are in line with customer needs and to those of our stakeholders. And we continue to make progress across our ESG pillars. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and driving diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, improving supplier diversity and helping customers meet their ESG goals. All in all, 2021 was a strong year, which positions us well moving forward. Turning to financial highlights. We achieved the full year expectations that we set earlier in the year. Demand was very strong, enabling us to finish the year at $13 billion in sales at the high end of our guided range. Organic daily sales growth was 12.7% for the year, 12.4% on an organic constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. Most notably, high-touch solutions in North America had exceptional growth at 10.8% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we outgrew the market by 100 basis points for the full year 2021, above where we expected to be and outgrew the market by 450 basis points on a two-year average. We faced our fair share of gross margin challenges throughout the year, primarily tied to inventory. We were able to recover well to end the year at 36.2%, resulting from our ability to manage price/cost spread and improved product mix. We delivered 11.9% operating margin, an increase of 65 basis points over the prior year. And lastly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and delivered a strong ROIC of 31.9%. We met the challenges of the year head on and delivered on our commitments for the full year. Turning to our quarterly results for the company. The story is similar with strong results to share. Baby sales exceeded our expectations and were up 16%, 16.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by double-digit growth in both segments with robust demand. Gross profit margin was 37.3%, 240 basis points above the prior year and in line with our expectations. Dee will go into more detail, but at a high level, because we follow the LIFO method of accounting, our results include an adjustment to reflect the building of core product inventory at higher costs in the fourth quarter, which allowed us to finish the year with a strong inventory position. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales was 24.9%, flat to prior year. When comparing to 2019, which is a more relevant comparison point, our SG&A leverage improved over 200 basis points in the quarter. SG&A was $836 million, driven by higher variable compensation as a result of our strong top line growth. We also saw elevated hourly wages and increased health care expenses and continue to invest in marketing. We gained operating margin leverage of 240 basis points over prior year result of the gross margin improvement. Finally, our resulting EPS was $5.44 for the quarter, up 48.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. And with that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter and our expectations for 2022. Dee?
Dee Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment. For the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong results with daily sales up 16.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, and up 21.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw continued strong growth of our core non-pandemic category. And as a result of our growth investments, we’re seeing continued growth with both large and midsized customers at 16% and 25%, respectively. The U.S. business also had strong price realization in the quarter. We’re encouraged by how Canada and Mexico finished the year both with positive daily sales growth in the fourth quarter. In Canada, the business saw a year-over-year sales growth with 11 of its 14 industries, most notably in our targeted in segments like manufacturing and higher education. Canadian daily sales were up 12.2% or 6.8% in local days local currency. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 39.6%, up 250 basis points versus the prior year, a very strong quarter for our High-Touch Solutions segment. We once again achieved price cost spreads slightly above neutral, and our pandemic product mix returned to near pre-pandemic levels, both driving positive improvement in gross profit. At the operating margin line, we saw an improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year, overall, a solid quarter for High-Touch Solutions. I’d like to go into a bit more detail specifically on our U.S. GP run rate. During the quarter, we achieved a gross margin rate of 40%. We’re encouraged by these results and the GP stabilization achieved in the fourth quarter. The pandemic product mix, our pricing actions and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges supported this achievement and will be the foundation for our GP expectations in 2022. As you’re aware, Grainger follows the LIFO accounting method, which requires us to revalue the majority of our mentors sold during the year based upon the most current purchase price. At the end of every year, we calculate our LIFO adjustment based upon our ending inventory balance. This year, we increased our inventory balance significantly in the fourth quarter to set us up for 2022, and our most recent purchases were at higher costs due to inflation. As a result, our LIFO adjustment is larger than we’ve historically seen. You’ll see this adjustment disclosed in our 10-K, and it’s important to remember that is a non-cash LIFO accounting impact and not a reflection of our operational performance. Moving to Slide 11. During the quarter, our core non-pandemic product sales were up 28% over the prior year fourth quarter. Compared to 2019, sales growth was quite strong at approximately 17%. In addition, our pandemic product sales were down year-over-year, remained elevated, up around 41% over 2019. As it relates to mix, our pandemic products totaled 21% of sales in the fourth quarter, very close to our pre-pandemic mix. We're excited that our product mix is stabilizing as customers return to more normal operations. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business was up 17% versus the fourth quarter 2020 and up 22% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 12. We estimate that the U.S. market grew between 10% and 11%, and we achieved 650 basis points of market share outgrowth in the fourth quarter, largely driven by returns on our key strategic initiatives. For the full year and slightly above our expectations, we achieved approximately 100 basis points of outgrowth. To normalize for volatility over the past two years, we're continuing to calculate and show the two-year average, which was about 600 basis points over the market for the fourth quarter of 2021. We remain committed to our U.S. share gain goal of 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth on an ongoing basis. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 15.2% or 20.6% on a constant currency basis driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and continued growth with enterprise customers in Japan. When we account for local days in local currency, MonotaRO daily sales grew 20.2%. GP expand 60 basis points year-over-year. As a result, operating margin for the segment fished up 45 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to improved gross profit margin. Zoro operating margin improved as a result of freight efficiency, specifically from its continued focus on B2B customers. MonotaRO operating margin was down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower gross margin, a result of their product mix in the quarter. Please note the slide covering both Zoro and MonotaRO financial performance is in the appendix. In addition, we also continue to see positive results in our operating metrics. Registered users are up 16% over the fourth quarter prior year. And on the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio with great progress this year. Overall, we continue to be impressed by the results of our Endless Assortment segment as we grow with the right customers. Moving to 2022 guidance. For the total company, we expect revenue between $14.1 billion and $14.5 billion, with daily sales growth between 7.5% and 10.5% driven by strong top line performance in both segments. It's worth noting there is also one more selling day in 2022. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily sales growth between 6.5% and 9.5%. For the U.S., we anticipate growth between 7% and 10%, 300 basis points above the estimated MRO market of 4% to 7%. We expect our share gain to be driven primarily by growing volume as a result of our strategic initiatives and that will continue to price to the market. In Canada, we expect to see mid-single-digit top line growth as we continue to diversify our customer base. In the Endless Assortment segment, we anticipate daily sales to grow roughly 14% or 18.5% in local currency and local days. Zoro's growth is anticipated to be in high teens, reflecting further SKU expansion and a continued focus on acquiring and retaining high-value customers. MonotaRO expects local currency growth rates in the high teens as well as they continue to grow with both small and enterprise customers. From a profitability perspective, total company GP is expected to be between 36.8% and 37.3%, up between 50 and 100 basis points in 2022. Consistent with 2021, we expect a similar LIFO accounting adjustment as we continue to see cost inflation and build inventory. We have factored into our guidance this impact. The gross profit margin expansion is driven primarily by the High-Touch Solutions segment as GP stabilizes near pre-pandemic levels and as we continue to target price/cost neutrality. Endless Assortment gross profit is expected to be essentially flat as GP expansion at Zoro is offset by a modest GP decline at MonotaRO. Total company operating margins are expected to be between 12.5% and 13.1%, and expand between 65 and 125 basis points versus 2021. These top line and profitability targets as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program, are expected to produce earnings per share between 23 50 and 25 50, and equated to growth between 18.5% and 28.5%. Both segments are expected to deliver high ROIC. Continuing on Slide 17, in addition to total company guidance, we wanted to provide operating margins by segment, along with our plans for capital allocation. For High-Touch Solutions, we expect operating margins between 14.4% and 15%, up between 130 and 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by gross margin expansion. SG&A leverage is expected to be modest, primarily due to continued investment in growth initiatives, anticipated health care expenses and higher wages. Endless Assortment operating margins are expected to be between 7.5% and 8.2%. This is primarily driven by MonotaRO as they continue to invest in DC capacity. Zoro continues to increase operating margins in line with our previous expectations. Cromwell represented and Other is expected to further reduce its operating losses. We anticipate closing the year with operating margin down at negative 6%. Our Cromwell improvement plan is behind our original expectations, driven primarily by business closures in the UK and the slowdown in the aerospace industry, one of their primary end markets. We remain confident in your ability to improve performance as during the pandemic, they have been able to grow with new customers and maintain high levels of service. Their results will primarily be dependent on the speed of recovery across different customer end markets. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. Our capital expenditures outlook for the year is between $275 million and $325 million. This includes DC investments in North America and Japan, ESG investments to improve sustainability of our facilities, KeepStock and IT enhancements in the U.S. and a normal level of maintenance capital. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and to continue share repurchases. For 2022, we are expecting between $600 million and $800 million of share repurchases, which continues to reflect our confidence in successfully executing our strategy and in our growth initiatives. We're optimistic for a more normal year with reasonable, sequential trends. As a result, we are now resuming more standard guidance practices. Similar to our approach before the pandemic, our guidance will be limited to annual expectations, and we will provide commentary and/or updates to our full year ranges as launch hits. With that, I will turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I want to really reiterate my appreciation for the Grainger team and our partnership with our customers and suppliers in this challenging year. While we all hope that 2021 will bring more normalcy than it in fact did, the team remained steadfast in our purpose of keeping the world working and in turn achieved outstanding results for the year, both financially and operationally. In the coming year, we will continue to focus on serving our customers better than anyone else, profitably growing market share and making Grainger a great place to work. We have three core priorities: first, execute on our growth drivers that provide customers with a flawless experience and tangible value to help them operate safely and effectively; second, drive operational excellence and productivity in all that we do to support our growth investments; and third, strengthen our culture and focus on talent development at all levels of the organization. We will execute these efforts with our long-term environmental, social and governance objectives in mind. Finally, I'm excited to announce that we'll be hosting an Analyst Day in the fall of this year, where we will be focused on providing more details on our strategic initiatives and longer-term outlook. With that, we will open the line, up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is Sophia [ph] on of for Nigel Coe. Congrats on the blockbuster quarter. It was amazing.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: So, my question was really on like the 2022 guide, you've kind of put forth HTS U.S., you see 300 bps of market outgrowth. How much of that do you really see volume versus the 3% price, I think, you've quoted in that particular segment?
D.G. Macpherson: So just to be clear, thanks for the question, and that's a good clarification point. And I can turn it over to Dee for specific. But in general, we talk about share gain, we're talking all about volume. So, our philosophy is to price to market, and then we expect to get volume share gain. That's how we think.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So, as it relates to the components for the U.S. market, we anticipate low single-digit volume growth at about 4% to 5% in price, which results in a market of about 4% to 7%. And there we expect to grow 300 basis points above the market which gets you to high-touch U.S. guide of between 7% to 10% growth.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That’s all for me.
Dee Merriwether: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. So I also want to follow up on the U.S. 2% outgrowth guidance. So certainly a positive level when we compare to the long-term outgrowth that the company has achieved. But it is below, I believe, 2021 came in at 4.5% outlook on the two year. In Q4, you guys add a very strong at over 6%. Is there anything specific that is kind of pushing that guidance down to just 3% in 2022?
Dee Merriwether: Yes. We expect 300. We’re really confident – at a minimum, we’re really confident in the first half outlook, and we anticipate robust growth and some price inflation there. But the second half remains really harder to predict for us. And so based upon having better visibility, we feel pretty confident in the outlook that we’ve stated right now. And know that as things change, we’ll be more than want to talk about that and talk about the changes in the future how does impact our results.
Chris Snyder: Appreciate that. And for my follow-up, I wanted to talk about Zoro margins. Previously, the company has communicated a pathway to getting sort of to high single-digit margins over three years. But over the last couple of quarters, Zoro gross margin has really surprised and impressed to the upside. Does that change the operating margin outlook for Zoro? And if you could just kind of refresh us on what’s the latest expectations for there? Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I guess I can start with that one. So we have not changed our expectations for Zoro operating margin. We still are on the same path. We talked about. We have gotten strong gross profit improvement in the business. Some of that – most of that is squarely focused on quality growth, so making sure we are acquiring business customers that have long-term positive value and really focusing our efforts there, which means we’ve gotten out of some lower quality growth avenues that we’ve had in the past. And that has shown a pop. That pop is going to stick, but you’re not going to see similar growth in the gross profit line like we’ve seen. That has been very specifically towards actions to improve the quality of our growth, and we think we’re on a good path now. But we’re still on the same operating margin.
Operator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Look, I fully respect that you guys are not a manufacturer, and that’s part – that’s a big advantage in this environment for sure. But you do have some manufacturing exposure with your private label. Just any update there, how you’ve been holding up in terms of supply chain issues there?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Yes. It’s a great question. So it’s – there’s a lot of chaos in the supply chain for sure. It has been very costly to get containers out of Asia. We have been prioritizing what we can get in. I think we’ve done a nice job of navigating the things that we can control. I think the other thing I would point to is we’ve done a really nice job of crossing items to more locally sourced items to help support customers during this time. And I think our ability to improve our product information has helped us navigate this. We are starting to see some loosening coming from Asia now, and we do expect things to get at least modestly better through the next couple of quarters. And so it’s been a challenge. I think it has been a constant seed if you’re working in the supply chain, certainly, the last year, our team has done a great job with navigating it. I think relatively, we’re doing well, but it’s challenging for sure.
Deane Dray: Yes, it really does look like you’re holding up well, so congrats there. And then second question, maybe some color on the CapEx plans. It’s an uptick from last year pretty noticeably. We’ve heard some companies say, Hey, look, they couldn’t – because of supply chain issues, they couldn’t do as much in the way of projects. There were delays there. So was this a catch-up and maybe some color on where that money is being spent? Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, I’ll turn it over to Dee in a second. I mean so it’s not necessarily a catch up. I’d say our CapEx is almost always in supply chain investments and in technology, and that will continue to be the case. I’ll turn it over to Dee to talk about specifics.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. Just a little bit more to add to that, D.G. I agree, really not a catch-up. We’re really focused on maintenance capital in the DC. The DC have been running hard. As you can expect, we’re trying to keep up with demand. And so we’re making sure that we’re spending the right amount of capital there. In addition to that, you hear us continue to talk about continued capacity investment in Japan. So that is a portion of that as well. We mentioned our focus on ESG. So that’s about 10% of our capital spend going into next year. So really just getting back to what we would call normal levels of capital as we come out of the recovery.
Operator: Our next question is from David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David Manthey: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Could you share with us the amount of the LIFO adjustment? And just to be clear, is that – is it still in the adjusted results you present here in the slides? Or is that factored out?
Dee Merriwether: So yes, the LIFO adjustment is in the adjusted results. And just want to remind everyone again that this is a noncash accounting entry and really is not reflective of operational performance. And so this year, at the end of the year, because we invested heavily in growing our inventory, so that it set us up well for the start of this year. That, coupled with cost inflation is the result of a larger adjustment than normal. And that adjustment, which you'll see in the 10-K is more than two times what it's historically been. So you'll see the net of tax around $49 million.
David Manthey: Okay. And I was under the impression that Grainger historically at least, was something like 30% FIFO in part of your business as well. And I'm just wondering, was there any kind of an offset from FIFO to offset some of that LIFO gain? Not explicitly in that number you just mentioned, Dee, but just operationally if you have some business on pipe when that might have benefited from the inflation.
Dee Merriwether: So you're correct. It's about 25%. That is factored into our numbers. We really didn't get a benefit from that this year. We don't expect to on a go forward basis unless inflation changes materially.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Merkel: Good morning. And thanks for all the details and guidance. My first question was on gross margin for 2022. Could you just unpack it a little bit more 4Q is exiting at 37.3%, but the low end of guidance for 2022 is 36.8%. Is that the LIFO impact? Or just what are the puts and takes?
Dee Merriwether: So if I just start back with the U.S. GP probably be a good place to start there. Our goal was to exit the year in line with pre-pandemic levels for high-touch U.S., and so we achieved that around 40%. We will expect high-touch U.S. GP to stabilize into 2022, but we're also expecting a little bit more normal seasonality for our plan this year. We do expect to continue to manage price cost were added to 2022. And then we'll have a little bit of compression potentially from EA. Even though the high touch business is growing much faster than it has historically been, it is still a little bit lighter than the EA business, so that causes a little bit of compression for us.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then pandemic sales flat in January, it's been negative, so the trend is looking good. I'm just wondering on the outlook there because I think you said it's still 40% above 2019. Just wonder, is there any give back as things sort of normalize? Or what's your feelings there?
Dee Merriwether: No, I don't see that. I think we're about where we expect to be. If you look at our January results sequentially, we're still up a little bit on pandemic sales, but – so we have a little way to go that we hope will help us in our current outlook. We've embedded that we get back to normal levels in 2022. So we've embedded that in our plan and in our guide.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Looking at the six points compound to your market outperformance in the fourth quarter, as everyone is talking about supplychain has got worse and tighter in the quarter. Are you a net beneficiary of that dynamic that everyone else is more bothered by just strictly from a volume perspective?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, I think there's a number of factors that go into that. We think we probably had some net benefit in the sense that we have product there, there's probably we don't have. And we've been able to navigate the challenge as well. And I talked about it before, but almost every customer call I have now talks about finding alternates that are in stock as opposed to waiting to get received from Asia, and we are aggressively helping our customers find solutions to keep them up and running. And I think that – all of that in our scale and the inventory pools we have help. We did build inventory in the back half of the year pretty significantly, and that has been a help as well. So I'd say we're a net beneficiary. And I think it's also helped us develop stronger relationships with our customers because we've been able to serve them during this time.
Christopher Glynn: That makes sense. And how do you assess the risk, if any, of that 4Q volume strength with being a net beneficiary on how you process the transition to the expected 2022 volume growth?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, I think Dee talked about this a little bit before. We have a lot more clarity about what we'd expect in the first half of the year. Just on compares, we would expect the first half of the year to be stronger in terms of revenue growth. That said, we look at run rate volumes, and we understand how our initiatives impact volume and we're confident in at this point and what we've talked about from a range and feel pretty good about the year in terms of our ability to grow.
Operator: Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning, thank you. My first question would just be just coming back medium customer strategy. We saw the growth numbers were pretty good. Could you maybe just remind us where you are in the process of gaining market share with medium customers? And is that number – could that number be similar to your large customer wallet share over time? Just any thoughts on where that's trending?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So just as a reminder for everybody, I think we've talked about this before. At our peak, we had about $2 billion worth of midsized customer sales. We went down to $800 million. We have recovered a portion of that, but we still have a long ways to go. And our share with midsized customers is still smaller. We are getting smarter in terms of our ability to acquire and develop relationships with midsized customers. It's hard to argue that we'd ever get to the wallet share in any reasonable time horizon that we have with large customers, we do think we can grow it faster than we grow large customers for years to come. So we're pretty confident in the growth path that we expect.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question, and I'll turn it over, is just – as you think about MonotaRO, you had strong enterprise customer growth. Is there an opportunity for enterprise customers at Zoro? Or is the market just different where you service that through the high-touch brand? Just any thoughts there would be great, too. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. And I think it's a really good question. The short answer is the competitive market is very, very different. In Japan, the market typically goes through wholesalers to local distributors to customers versus what we have in the U.S. with the big distributors that serve customers with all kinds of services today. And so we don't see an opportunity for Zoro and our enterprise customer business. We see that squarely on the shoulders the Grainger brand and the high-tech solutions and the competitive environment makes that very different in the U.S. And so that's our growth path there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: So just a follow-up on some of the market share dynamics. Maybe if you could talk about how kind of supply chain inconsistency has helped Grainger. I got to imagine that for maybe your smallest competitors, those guys are still having a hard time getting product and or maybe the most likely to use price as sort of a competitive weapon. How do you think share gains sort of attributable to that have trended here kind of through the second half? And what do you expect as we kind of continue in this tighter supply chain environment at least through the first half of this year?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean, I think through the last two years, we have done well in terms of navigating the supply chain. At first, it was pandemic product. And this past year, it was mostly non-pandemic product, where we have been able to find solutions and work with our customers and our suppliers to figure out how to get the right solutions for our customers. I don't see that changing at all in the first half of the year. I think we're going to be constrained. I know we're constrained now and we'll continue to be constrained as an industry. So I think the things we've been working on figuring out how to help customers find the right solutions in a constrained world will continue to be beneficial. And certainly, we don't really know how every distributor is doing. But having the inventory pools we have, having the information we have, having the data, having the deep customer relationships all helps us help our customers navigate through these really challenging times.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just from an end market perspective, what percentage of the portfolio, if any, because I know you have some important customer groups and maybe some hospitality, airlines, things like that, is still below pre-pandemic levels.
D.G. Macpherson: I'm not sure if I've got the exact numbers. It's – I would say most industries are above pre-pandemic levels for us now. Pretty much all manufacturing would be – there might be some sub-segments. We mentioned aerospace in the UK, aerospace has been challenged, for sure. And then there are certainly industries that we supported like cruise lines and hotels and airlines that are still below. It's a small portion of our total, and we continue to support those customers well and expect to continue to support those customers. But I think it's sort of we aren't talking as if the large portion of our customer base is challenged right now. We're seeing very strong demand in general, and we know there are sub-segments that are still struggling. We would expect those to recover over the next couple of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Michael McGinn: Hey, good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to the cash flow conversation. It seems like it's a little heavy on working capital or at least the conversion is a little bit below historic levels. Any comments on the timing of the MonotaRo DC load-in process, also general inventory, how you're preparing for pre and post Chinese New Year?
Dee Merriwether: Well, you want me to start, D.G. and then maybe you can talk about operations?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes.
Dee Merriwether: So when you look at our operating cash flow for the year, really two components contribute to that. And neither reasons – neither of them is really a reason for concern for us. And so the major factor was really our decision to invest in inventory later in the year, so we could have a strong start. And the second one was we had a very robust sales growth in the U.S. in December, really exceptionally strong. And so accounts receivable – our accounts receivable balance increased based upon the number of orders, but most of those payments are going to come due early in the year. So we're already seeing a consistent trend to what we've seen in prior years related to AR developed. However, as long as we continue to drive very strong sales, our AR balance would be higher than what it has traditionally been, and we expect to continue to support growth with inventory investment. I know you have a question specifically about inventory related to Chinese New Year. So I'll turn it back to D.G. for that.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean without going into too many details, we always look at Chinese New Year and try to get out in front of it. Part of the inventory build that we had was being able to pull full containers in earlier, clearly, things are still backed up coming out of China. The Chinese New Year, we're in the midst of it. When it comes out, it typically takes two to four months for things to get totally back to normal. We do expect some ease of supply chain, some more flow to come in. We're starting to see signs that, that is likely to occur. But certainly, this year, we – it wasn't just Chinese New Year. We're just managing constrained supply chains, and so that was part of it.
Michael McGinn: Great. And then somewhat more of a longer-term question with Zoro SKUs fast approaching the $10 million benchmark. Can you talk about the addition and curation process? And are you now able to leverage search on the platform to target potentially high-volume value-add SKUs that would benefit or versus using external search dynamics in the past? And then also maybe the general learnings and mix improvement from last quarter, where I think you mentioned some channels were turned off.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, yes. So we expect to have a strong SKU count addition this year, the team is working on analytics and works with the team in Japan as well to understand which customers and which product pairs we want to go after. So we do most of that analytically. We use some platform, artificial intelligence type tools to help with that. But a lot of it's good old-fashioned analytics and understanding which target segments we want to go after small business segments we want to go after and which products to add. We continue to have a lot of success with getting those products in and having them be a source of growth for those customer segments.
Operator: Our next question is from Pat Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Pat Baumann: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go at the share gain thing in the High-Touch business from a little bit different vantage point. Can you talk about the revenue growth you saw for the year in that segment broken down between like the digital piece, whether that's EDI or website? And then how that compares to kind of the growth rates you're seeing in KeepStock and the branches. Just curious where you're seeing the most growth across those different channels and then how you see that playing out into this year?
D.G. Macpherson: I'm sorry, just to clarify the question. Did you say Endless Assortment or?
Pat Baumann: No, no, no, specifically High-Touch, just thinking about the different channels in High-Touch that you touch the customer with.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Yes. So we had strong growth through almost all the channels. I would say that KeepStock grew faster than the core business last year, continues to be a really core driver of growth in serving customers on site. As does ePro, which is typically connecting our systems directly to purchasing systems. So we continue to have a lot of large complex customers that have multiple points of stickiness and helps the customer manage their purchasing process and their inventory. We have seen, obviously, strong growth with digital, grainger.com has continued to grow very quickly. I think if you looked at it with midsized customers, you'd see digital as the primary source of growth. And if you look at it with large complex customers, you'd see more balance with strong growth in cube stock and ePro is what you typically see.
Pat Baumann: Understood. So that would mean that if those are all growing faster than branches are growing slower, I guess, than the rest?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I think over the last two years, branches have grown slower than e-commerce. That doesn't mean they aren't growing. They've actually had solid growth. But yes, I think Dee, you correct me, I think I'm pretty sure that branch, if you look over the last few years, walk-in traffic has been down, and the pandemic is probably contributed to that. We saw a nice bounce back this year after a pretty significant down in 2020.
Dee Merriwether: That's correct, D.G. Right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Ken Newman: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Ken Newman on for Steve. Thanks for taking the question.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Ken Newman: Good morning. I just wanted to circle back on the December ADS number. I think you guys had mentioned. It did see a pretty decent sized jump up from October, November despite it looks like it would be a slightly more difficult comp. Can you just talk through what drove that jump? And where is ADS kind of trending now through January?
Dee Merriwether: So again, you've also Slide 11, you'll see in High-Touch U.S., our January estimate up about 15%, and that's posed by the pandemic and non-pandemic sales at answers your trending for January question.
Ken Newman: Sure. That makes sense. Okay.
Dee Merriwether: And then for December sales, I think I'd go back to like what D.G. has articulated, a lot of customers are finding our product availability to be appealing, and we believe that led to a lot of our growth in the U.S. later in the December time frame driven by core pandemic or non-pandemic products.
Ken Newman: Understood. And then for my follow-up, I'm just curious if you can give a little more color on the capacity investments in Zoro and MonotaRO. Any color on the timing of when you expect the margin trends to kind of return back to normalized levels? Or how do you view the ramp of more normalized ROIC for those investments?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, that's a good question. So it affects MonotaRO only. Zoro is not having unusual investments at this point, and we expect the operating margin to continue to expand for Zoro the next several years. MonotaRO has – given the Japanese geographic footprint, it's not as broad or as big as the U.S., obviously. And they have very high-volume DCs but very few of them. And so what you're seeing right now is expansion – capacity expansion around Tokyo and Osaka, which are the two primary places where you need distribution capacity. And you're going to see a lot of redundant assets this year, which is why costs go up, and you're basically running two buildings and doing the transfer. That falls off in 2023. So in 2023, you'll see more of a normal return to SG&A for the MonotaRO business. It's just the – I think they're going from a 1.1 million square foot building to 1.7 million or something like that around the socket. These are very large buildings. And when you're running both of them at the same time, you have a lot of redundant costs during the transition.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: All right. Well, thank you. I appreciate everybody's questions, and thanks for the time today. We obviously feel good about the way the year ended and are excited about 2022. We're going to stay focused on making sure we provide the right solutions to our customers, and investing in things that I think the thing I'm most excited about is we have a lot of things we can still get a lot better at. And so it does feel like we are working on the right things, and we'll stay committed to making sure that we build the right systems and processes to support our customers and win for the future. So I hope you all stay warm and you're not getting hit too hard by the storm and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-29 18:13:03) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the WW Grainger Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference, call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require Operator assistance during the conference, please press star 0 on your telephone keypad.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcoming to Grainger 's third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially due to various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q3 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website.  This morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public Company and follows Japanese GAAP, which just differs from U.S. GAAP, and is reported in our results, one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed today will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. With that, I'll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The Grainger Edge is a framework that defines who we are, why we exist, and where we're going while establishing a set of operating principles. I'm proud of the ways that we use the principles to guide decisions and deliver results. I want to start this quarter with a big thank you. Things are very challenging on many fronts.  Given the ongoing pandemic in labor and material shortages, nothing in the world seems to be working exactly the way it should. Our manufacturing partners, transportation partners, Grainger team members, and certainly our customers are all finding harder than ever to keep the world working. I want to thank all of them for their tremendous efforts. I also want to offer particular thank you to front line workers who continue to go above and beyond.  Grainger is proud to support the hospital staff, government agencies, teachers, and many others, who continue to do great work in a very challenging environment. I might say that in spite of these challenges, we performed very well, but in reality, it's partly because of how we're wired that Grainger is doing so well. We've seen strong demand this quarter, especially in the U.S.  We have product available in our network and have been able to ship it to customers quickly. Our service to customers has been exceptional given the circumstances. We're leveraging our scale, demonstrating our agility, and gaining share. Our goal is to always be in an advantaged position to help our customers solve their problems. As I've been out with customers this past quarter time and again, I hear that Grainger is executing well. Customers tell me that they are pleased with our performance and you can see this in our revenue growth.  While the current supply chain environment is volatile and uncertain, we are confident in our current plans and our readiness to respond to any evolving dynamics. In the face of labor and material shortages throughout the supply chain, we are providing strong relative service and helping our customers avoid disruptions. We continue to actively leverage our network, even if sometimes we have to get the orders from less optimal locations at a higher cost. We are investing in inventory, while actively monitoring the freight market in the West Coast ports.  And as it relates to labor, we have made great progress, including staffing gaps and training team members, which has resulted in improvements, especially in our DC operations. Our customer research shows that this is driving customer satisfaction. Turning to our financial highlights, demand in the quarter was robust, resulting in strong revenue and gross margin performance, and well-managed SG&A. We achieved organic daily sales growth of 11.9% for the total Company on a constant currency basis.  When compared to Q3, 2019, the quarter was up 17.3% on a daily organic basis, driven primarily by core non-pandemic product sales, which is a positive indicator of our underlying run-rate performance. Our High-Touch Solutions, North America segment grew 11.6% on a daily constant-currency basis. In the U.S., we drove approximately 100 basis points of share outgrowth versus the prior year, and 475 basis points on a two-year average.  We remain confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. Our service to customers, especially the last two years, has contributed to meaningful share gains. Our endless assortment segment finished the quarter with 14.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis. I'd like to note two things that temporarily moderated growth in this segment. First, Zoro lapped a very strong third quarter in 2020.  For context, we opened up pandemic product supply to Zoro customers in Q3 2020, that was previously reserved mostly for government and healthcare customers. In the third quarter of 2021, Zoro managed to drive 11.9% revenue growth. And when we compare that to Q3 2019, we're up 30.6%, which is really strong. Also, MonotaRO was impacted by several external factors, including a slow start to vaccinations and a generally slower Japanese economy.  In local days and local currency, sales were up about 17.5% compared to Q3, 2020. And MonotaRO continues to take share, especially as COVID restrictions lift, and we grow with our targeted enterprise customers. And as we look at results versus Q3 2019, MonotaRO 's sales are up over 37%. We feel that the comparison to 2019 for both businesses is more indicative of our underlying business strength.  We still expect the segment to close the year with growth at about 20% above prior year. We saw strong gross margin expansion across all segments even above our expectations that we discussed last quarter. High-Touch Solutions North America was up 140 basis points over Q3 of the prior year, and Endless Assortment was up 115 basis points. Dee will cover the drivers for both segments.  Last year we returned $327 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter, and we maintain strong return on invested capital of 31.4%. Turning to our quarterly results for the Company, I discussed most of what's on this slide, but I wanted to point out a few additional items. First, our SG&A was $812 million, right where we thought it would be. We continue to invest in marketing and labor primarily to increased variable compensation and great wage rates in the DCs.  And like many companies, we're also starting to see increased healthcare costs as team members return to routine medical visits and undergo deferred elective procedures. And while overall spending is up versus the prior year, we're still gaining significant leverage when compared to 2019. Our operating earnings were $438 million, up 17.4%, and our resulting EPS is $5.65 for the quarter, which is growth of 25%. Overall, this was a really strong quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail. Dee?
Dee Merriwether: Thanks, DG. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continued to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. In the U.S. we saw strong growth, especially in our core non-pandemic product categories. Both large and mid-sized customer saw significant growth at 10% and 19% respectively.  Canada continues to be slow as recurring shutdowns in many of the larger provinces had businesses closed or operating at minimal capacity. As vaccination rates improve and businesses reopen, we expect more typical purchasing behavior to resume and sales to follow. Canadian daily sales were up 11.7% or 5.7% in local days and local currency compared to the third quarter of 2020. For the High-Touch Solutions segment, GP margins finished the quarter at 39.4% up 140 basis points versus the prior year Third Quarter.  Our focus and diligence on managing price cost spread contributed to our GP improvement. In the quarter we saw strong price realization to customers, both on-contract and wet pricing. Our realization was better than anticipated, and as a result, price cost spread was above neutral. In addition, consistent with the Second Quarter, our U.S. pandemic product mix was about 22%, an improvement versus 28% in the Third Quarter of 2020.  We are confident that our run rate GP remains strong and we'll finish in line with the expectations we set forth for the Fourth Quarter. On slide 20, you will find a chart with details on the U.S. and Canadian businesses. This information has been provided to help bridge our prior reportable segments to our new High-Touch Solutions North America segment. I'd like to give you some advanced notice that we will continue to show daily sales and gross margin by business.  However, as our operating expenses across the segment have become more intertwined, our operating margin by geography, will no longer be provided in our 2022 reporting. On slide 9, taking a deeper dive into High-Touch Solutions for the U.S., the Delta variant and the renewed mass mandates in July reversed the declining trend we were seeing in the second quarter for pandemic products.  As the virus surged, we saw pandemic product demand pick back up, especially for mass. However, a particular note, our core non-pandemic sales growth was at or above 20% every month in the third quarter. We are encouraged to see this growth as a sign of more regular business and economic activities. When comparing core non-pandemic sales to Q3 2019, sales were up 12%, which is quite strong. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business is up 12% for the third quarter 2021, and up 16% as compared to 2019.  Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, in the third quarter as expected, we saw our share gain grow as we let more reasonable yet still inflated Q3 2020 comparisons. In the quarter, we estimated the U.S. market grew between 10.5% and 11.5% resulting in our estimated outgrowth of approximately 100 basis points versus Q3 2020. To normalize for volatility, we're continuing to show the two-year average share gain, which was about 475 basis points over the market for the third quarter of 2021, a really exceptional result.  Given the noise and fluctuations in the market number across industrials, the 2-year average is a better estimate of our true market outgrowth. We remain focused on our key initiatives, which give us confidence in our ability to achieve our U.S. share gain goal of growing 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market. Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. We saw a significant lift in the High-Touch U.S. GP performance in the quarter.  Sequentially, we wanted to comment on two of the biggest factors that make up the difference between the Second Quarter and the Third Quarter. First, the biggest contributor, the inventory adjustments are behind us as anticipated. In addition, we're seeing greater price realization than expected. I'll note that while we sold some of the pandemic inventory that was previously written down, the impact of GP was immaterial.  We're encouraged by these results, and are confident in our ability to achieve our expected 40.1% GP rate in Q4 based on continued pandemic mix improvements, our expected price realization in the Fourth Quarter, and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges. Moving to our endless assortment segment, daily sales increased 12.7% or 14.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO, as well as growth of larger enterprise customers at MonotaRO.  GP expanded 115 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by Zoro U.S. We took a number of pricing actions based on evolving market conditions and we de -emphasize lower margin channels. In addition, we experienced improved rate efficiencies to Zoro primarily as a result of fewer B2C customers who typically place smaller orders that are more expensive to ship. Operating margin for the segment finished up 80 basis points over the prior year third quarter, due primarily to improved gross profit margin.  I'll go into more detail on the next slide as we provide further transparency on the results for both businesses. Moving to Slide 13 in local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 17.5% compared to the third quarter of 2020. GP margin finished the quarter at 25.8%, 30 basis points below the prior-year third quarter, as we continue to grow with enterprise customers.  As a result, operating margin decreased 65 basis points to 12%. Switching to Zoro U.S., daily sales grew 11.9% as compared to the strongest sales quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 375 basis points to 33.9% and achieved 325 basis points of operating margin expansion. In addition to the strong financial performance in this segment, we also continue to execute well on our key initiatives.  First, when it comes to our registered users, we saw continued growth across both businesses, which is an important driver of top-line performance. And on the right, Zoro continues to actively add skews to the portfolio. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, we had a total of 8 million skews available online, achieving our goal for the year a quarter early. Adding nearly 2 million skews in the last 9 months. We remain encouraged by our progress with skew additions.  Once again, I would like to provide some color commentary as it relates to the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, for revenue, we expect total Company daily sales to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. We anticipate Company gross margin will fall between 37.2% and 37.4%. As discussed before, we expect the U.S. GP rate to exit the year at or above pre -pandemic levels.  And for SG&A, we expect a similar level of spending in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter between 810 million and 815 million, with increased variable compensation, wages, and healthcare expenses. And while it's unclear at this point, we may have some additional risk as it relates to vaccine mandate costs. Given the strong performance in the quarter, we remain confident in our guidance range.  For the full year, we expect revenue to be at or above the midpoint, and all other metrics to be stronger than the low end of the range we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but likely still below the midpoint, given the pandemic inventory adjustments taken in the first half. With that, I'd like to turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks. Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I have just a few points.  First, I am immensely proud of the Grainger team and their commitment. It's been very challenging, but we continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our team and our supply chain. Second, it was a very good cut quarter across the board, the results were above our expectations. And finally, despite the current market and supply chain uncertainties, we are confident in our ability to deliver solid performance in the Fourth Quarter and into 2022. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, we'll be conducting our question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press one -- >  One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your question.
Chris Snyder : Thank you. So, my first question is on North America High-Touch growth relative to Zoro. Is it fair to assume that the Company prioritizes High-Touch volumes over endless assortment during periods of tight supply? just given the better margin and more important customers ally, stickier customers on the high margin side?
D.G. Macpherson : Thanks for the question, and the answer to that question is no. In terms of inventory position, we've been able to serve both the High-Touch model and Zoro well throughout this period. What I would say is that if you're thinking about Zoro's growth, there's a couple of things that are impacting Zoro 's growth rate in the quarter and they will get better as we move forward.  One was last year we opened up in the third quarter, the safety products to Zoro and as a result, customer acquisitions and revenue were extremely high and a lot of the customer acquisitions were consumers as well as people are just looking and scrambling to find product.  The other thing is we've been very clear and focused on attractive business acquisitions. And as a result, we have shut off some channels for acquisition that weren't as profitable long-term. And that's going away moving forward as well. And so that's been a bit of a drag on Zoro, but it hasn't been because we haven't been shipping product from Zoro. We've been serving customers well across both models.
Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then second question, I just want to talk about the mid-sized opportunity. Prior to the 2017 price reset, if I remember correctly, the Company had lost a lot of that mid-sized business prior to the reset, but it's coming back really strong up almost 20% in Q3. Can you just help us frame this opportunity going forward? Is there any risk around Zoro cannibalization? And then what kind of gross margin tailwinds could this bring to the Company?
D.G. Macpherson : Sure. That was a big part of the reason for resetting prices, was we had gone through a long period of decline with mid-sized customers. And here we're really talking about mid-sized customers that have some sort of mechanical complexity. So, think about mid-sized manufacturers or companies that really value some of the technical products support, search capabilities of the Grainger model.  Obviously, since the price reset, we've captured a lot of that back. We're still fairly significantly below our high point with mid-size customers. We feel like we've got a long runway ahead of us. We're getting smarter all the time. We're not seeing much cannibalization with Zoro. Zoro tends to focus on smaller businesses and businesses that are maybe a little narrower in what their needs are, and so they tend to segment to different types of customers more.  The Grainger midsize customer typically has fairly high mechanical complexity or complexity of some type. And so, we are really pleased with what we're seeing. I would say I think we went from 2 billion to less than 1 billion in that space over a 10-year period, and now we've covered some of that, we haven't covered all that, we think we can get back above 2 billion, so we think we've got a long runway ahead.
Dee Merriwether: And D.G., I would just add as it relates to contribution to gross margin. In the quarter it helped us about 10 basis points. And based upon the difference in the large growth rate versus the medium growth rate, if this around that amount, 10% versus 19%, 10% of gross margin, basis points improvement is reasonable.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your questions.
Christopher Glynn: Yes. Thanks. Congratulations on a good quarter. From the approximately 20% outlook for Endless Assortment for the year, it does imply pretty decent sequential ramp into the fourth quarter. I'm just curious, you've mentioned the Japanese economy. I don't know if you're seeing a pivot there right now. And you also mentioned the channel emphasis shifts at Zoro. Does that imply they're lapping or something?
D.G. Macpherson : Yes. Get it. Both of those things are correct. So, in Japan, they got a really slow start to vaccinations and had fairly hard shutdowns over the summer, and they've rectified their problem. They now have pretty high vaccination rates and we're starting to see more activity with larger manufacturing customers, in particular in Japan.  So, we are seeing some improvement there and expect to see that continue. With Zoro, yes, we have effectively lapped some of the actions we took to focus more on profit and customer acquisitions so both of those things should help us moving into the fourth quarter.
Christopher Glynn: Great. And then the price realization obviously came in better than you expected, as you said. You have a lot of freight contracts that have been good. At some point, those come out and you also at times in the past have had ability to defer costs increases from suppliers at times. So, I'm wondering how those figures in given that you've been really locked down really tightly on the gross margin view here and how it transpired. We in a sweet spot there as you pivot into '22 with some of those things I mentioned come into play?
D.G. Macpherson : Let me try to answer the question. We generally try to think about managing cost as well as we possibly can. We are obviously working with our suppliers on a constant basis in this environment to make sure that we are taking cost increases that makes sense and pushing back things if they don't make sense. Our spires have been great about working with us to find the right path for cost increases. And then on transportation, sort of the same thing.  We really are focused on understanding what cost increases are reasonable in working with our suppliers and our partners to get the right outcome. We priced the market. I think in general when you have inflationary periods, not this type of inflationary period but normal inflationary periods, we've historically probably been able to take market price increases and not have as much cost increase or have it delayed.  And so, we will sometimes have a period of advantage. I think right now given the pace of cost increases, I think we're pretty well matched and we'll continue to be pretty well matched. And that's our expectation given there has been a lot of off-cycle cost increases and we've been able to price this through as we go. I would say I don't think there's a big gap right now, or a big benefit right now. We're just -- it's a fairly wild time obviously in the supply chain, and we're -- I think we're navigating through it well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.
Ryan Merkel: Thanks. Good morning. D.G., you mentioned that your navigating supply chain costs will create challenge as well. Can you talk about some of the actions that you took?
D.G. Macpherson : Well, you know, I guess the probably can't talk about all the details, but there's challenges at every stage of the supply chain at this point. And so, I think the amount of work that's required to navigate here is much more than you would find in a typical setting. One of the things we did do is we saw some challenges coming on the horizon, we actually pretty ordered a bunch of products early in the year, try to get inventory and we have been able to build some inventory throughout the year.  Maybe not as much as we'd like, but we have been able to build some inventory that helped us. Our supplier management team and product teams are working very closely together to find -- make sure we've got the right substitute products so we can serve customers if there's a gap in a particular supplier that can't provide us the product. We are actively prioritizing product coming off of Asia.  We have up-wages and distribution centers and gotten staffing right, so we are basically clean, consistently now, which is good. That was a little bit a bit of a challenge back in May. So basically, if you follow the supply chain view at every single step, we are working it every single step of the way. And there's really no other path right now but just to make sure we are executing as well as possible at using our agility and our scale to try to make sure we can service our customers, and we've done that well.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Makes sense. Okay, and my follow-up is on SG&A leverage. I know in '21 you had costs returning and then of course higher costs from the supply chain issues. My question is, how should we think about SG&A leverage in '22. Are you able to have productivity offset higher costs or do you expect costs to ramp further off of the 4Q baseline?
Dee Merriwether: Well, I can take that D.G. Our focus right now is making sure that we can continue to serve customers well. Some of the rampage you've noted is due to some of the actions we took last year to really have tight cost controls around that time period. So when -- I think a good measure is probably to look at our 2019 costs and look at some of the SG&A leverage we have been able to gain over that time period since we haven't provided maybe real guidance related to 2022 yet.  But that's how we're focusing on it. And we are still looking to continue to gain leverage as we head into 2022. Very similar to what we were doing around 2019-time frame is the best I'd be able to tell you at this point in time. But we are not getting off the fact that we're focused on continuing to gain SG&A leverage over the longer term.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
D.G. Macpherson : Morning.
Dee Merriwether: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Hey, good morning. I appreciate you gave price costs for the U.S. High-Touch Business. What was price costs for the total Company, if you can be specific or directionally? And then do you have a target for 2021 just given the circumstances in terms of supply chain pressures, inflation, etc.?
Dee Merriwether: Yes. Yeah. We don't measure EA on price, cost basis, so that's why you don't hear us talk about total Company price costs. But the thing I will say is, all of the segments and all of the businesses are very focused on 1, maintaining price competitiveness, and 2, in this inflationary period, being able to pass on cost to customers. So that is a consistent tenant for us, so that is what I can say. And the other thing I would say.
Deane Dray: Got it.
D.G. Macpherson : Deane, to your question, clearly Zoro had very high price costs leverage given the GP improvement. Like we said, some of that's just segment-specific, which customers they're acquiring and how they're thinking about acquiring it. But we do expect their most assortment to continue to have strong profitability and profitably improvement in Zoro.
Deane Dray: Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up just related to price, the 3% points in price and High-Touch this quarter, just what's the expectation for 4Q? Does that carry -- are there other price actions that you've taken? And do you -- was that -- will that all carry into 2022? Is there any sense of some pushback, receptivity issues in terms of pricing? Do we carry that into 2022 or not?
Dee Merriwether: We did take some pricing actions in September. And we saw some good results there, and also through the month of October thus far. So, we expect that momentum to carry us through Q4. And like always, D.G. mentioned our supply management team is continuing to work with our supply base on what increases look like for 2022. And we expect to continue. We do get more costs to pass that through early in Q1.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. As a percentage of sales gross margin and OpEx, I think will be very different in 2022 versus what they were in 2019. And the reason I mentioned that, Dee, you made a comment about leverage in 2022 being similar to 2019. Were you referring to contribution margins there? Or if you can just help clarify that statement.
Dee Merriwether: Sure. So was trying to get some contact since we are not talking about 2022 at this point, just to help you understand that we're focused on gaining leverage and back in 2019, we had set out a path to say that we were looking to continue to focus on growing expenses less than sales. So that's the tenant that I was trying to articulate since we are not giving guidance on 2022 at this point.
David Manthey: Okay, understood. And then as it relates to your pricing mechanisms, I think you talked before about the open pricing on the website. You can just adjust immediately, but could you talk about contract pricing and what I'm wondering is where are you being most effective in recapturing inflation these days? Is it just the low spot prices or is it surcharges or renegotiating contracts, how are you being so effective at this point?
Dee Merriwether: So, we are capturing price inflation in all areas. I would say with customers that primarily by on web price, and we've contract customers. Earlier in the year, we talked about the fact that it would be a little lumpy because of the timing as it relates to when we could pass on price with customers, but similar to some of the actions that D.G. articulated, that we are executing as it relates to supply chain.  That also goes for the commercial teams, as they are working with customers to pass on price. So, we're close to the end of the year now and a lot of those discussions that both our sales team and then online, we've been able to pass on these costs pretty effectively. So that applies to contract customers, as well as web-based customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please state your question.
Adam Uhlman: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing with your Keep Stock business, how sales have been unfolding there. And it would seem like you should be having better access in the customer side. So, I'm wondering if you could share any insights about new customer wins or any new initiatives recently or maybe what you have planned for next year.
D.G. Macpherson : Sure. We continue to -- the Keep Stock is really a critical portion of our business. It's been -- a portion of our business has been obviously busy throughout the pandemic. We've had access to all of our customer inventory, well, not all but the vast majority of customer inventory locations and have continued to serve customers well through Keep Stock. We have put in a number of improvements to help us be more effective in planning. customers inventory and fulfilling customers inventories to Keep Stock.  We continue to get significant growth out of Keep Stock. Certainly, heavy manufacturing has come back this year. It's been very, very good for our Keep Stock business and that because of the heavy Keep Stock area. I won't talk too much about what we're investing in, other than to say we are investing significantly in improved software capabilities to enable us to provide better service to customers and better analytical insights to customers. And that's going to be a continuous focus for us around the Keep Stock area.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Dee, I think you had mentioned vaccine mandate costs, and I believe that there's some element of -- with the G&A contract, there might be a requirement for vaccination. Could you just help me understand what all that might mean for Grainger and the potential cost for the business?
D.G. Macpherson : Do you want -- I'll take this one. This is a kind of challenging one in many ways, we are certainly a federal contractor. We will comply with G&A order. We have planned in place to comply with that. I would say the OSHA ruling, and how that comes down, is probably more of a question mark in terms of vaccine mandate cost. We are ready to do what we need to do, and prepared to do whatever needs to happen. We are hopeful that the vaccine mandate is done in a way that doesn't hurt the supply chain.  I've been in our transportation depo's and our facilities and our customers' facilities and a vaccine mandate that's not well thought through could cause significant problems to an already challenged supply chain. And so, we are -- we don't know where all that's going to land just to be clear. But we are prepared and we've done some things to prepare for any eventuality there and trying to understand what the best path forward is going to be depending on how  vaccines go.?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Levenson with Melius Research. Please state your question.
Jacob Levenson: Good morning, everybody.
Dee Merriwether: Morning.
Jacob Levenson: Just wanted to -- you guys have a pretty clean balance sheet at this point and DG and I are new. When you took the helm a couple of years ago, you flexed up a little bit, and that's more aggressive buybacks. So maybe you can just help us think for higher look in the balance sheet today and maybe secondarily to that, whether M&A could play a role over the next couple of years.
Dee Merriwether: This is Dee, I'll start off. We like our credit rating, of course, and we don't see any big changes related to our capital allocation strategy. We did provide guidance that from a share buyback, we thought we would be somewhere between the 600 to 700 million range for the year. And we think we're going to be at the high end for this year. And so no real, I would say changes to our philosophies that we've had in the past, that's working well for us.
Jacob Levenson: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe this is a bit of a   something that we don't -- doesn't get a lot of airtime is maybe you can help us understand that are how the -- how that business is doing and how the turnarounds were going on the update there.
D.G. Macpherson : Maybe --
Dee Merriwether: D.G. you want to start?
D.G. Macpherson : I'll just get past it. Cromwell is a relatively -- it's obviously not a huge business for us, but it's an important one in terms of understanding whether we can get the growth we need to get in the U.K. I said, UK market has been challenged. Team's done a nice job of improving service and serving customers through this time. They have over the last few years, they will consistently lower the loss.  And we feel like it's a business that has a potential to be a strong contributor from a profit perspective over time. But we still have some work to do. But I would say that they've reset their cost structure, they're providing great service to customers, and they have lowered their losses over the last few years. And we would expect them to show profitability coming out of 2022.
Dee Merriwether: The only thing I'd add there is that on the quarter, Clan well was able to cut their losses year-over-year, and we expect them to come close to cutting them in half, which is what the focus has been, year-over-year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please state your question.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. My question was just around Zoro U.S. Maybe just talk about the competitive dynamic in that market. I know its smaller customers online-only et - cetera. But just maybe talk about who you're competing with there. And then I guess you have 8 million skews. Where could that skew count goes eventually?
D.G. Macpherson : Well, so on the second half of that question, we have 8 million skews today, we would expect to get to 10 million in the next couple of years at a minimum. And whether or not it goes to 15 or more is probably still open for debate, but we know we've got a long way to go to get the skew count t right. In terms of the competitive market, it's really very, very broad online. It's big Internet players. It's certain marketplaces.  Customers sometimes buy through smaller local retailers as well. And so, there's a very broad competitive set when you look at small businesses and how they buy, sometimes they buy through hardware stores.  And it's pretty fragmented today and there's a lot of different options for small businesses to buy MRO products. And so that market in particular super fragmented. And so, we feel like we're growing and gaining share from a number of different sources, but it's not like there's one or two players that are dominating that space, it is very, very broad in terms of competitive set.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And my follow-up question, I'll turn it over just on achieving pre -pandemic gross margin s in the U.S. business exiting this year. I know you've talked about price realization, you talked about inventory adjustments, etc. But maybe just talk about the confidence level there and what could go wrong for you not to achieve that? I know we are already in the fourth quarter, so there's two months left or whatever, so any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson : Go ahead, Dee.
Dee Merriwether: Yeah. What I would say is, we're pretty confident, and that's why we continue to focus on showing you where we've come from and where we're going in the decks, and continue to talk about it.  But the two biggest factors that really give us confidence is the product mix. Where we are versus last year, we were at -- in the U.S., we were at 28% on pandemic, and now we're at 22% and trending as we would expect. And then price, which we've talked quite a bit about here today. So, I noted earlier that we implemented some price increases in September, and the realization in September and October is looking good.  We expect that to continue through the fourth quarter, and we expect it to cover costs that we have visibility to. And as it relates to anything else related to supply chain challenges, D.G. talked a lot about that. We are very focused on it and we believe our scale puts us in a unique position to deal with some of those challenges today. We have good availability and we're managing the cost process well, so I think we're pretty confident.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Luke Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Dankert: Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just thinking about the Endless Assortment business here. Again, 20% growth over the medium-term, aggressive -- very impressive growth, but I guess, strategically what's the biggest bottleneck to growth in that business? When given the scalability of digital, if it is simply customer awareness and engagement, which obviously takes time, but what -- why couldn't that be 30% or something even higher at this point?
D.G. Macpherson : Yeah, I think if you look at the long history of MonotaRO you start to understand the limits. Obviously that business has gone from nothing to over $2 billion and has a very long history of growing very, very quickly. But 20% has been a number that they've been at for a long time.  Most of that has to be -- is really about making sure that you have the process' systems in place to acquire attractive small business customers or business customers. And then you have to work very hard to get them to repeat and to become regular purchasing customers. And that is not something that throwing a whole bunch of money at necessarily helps.  You've got to be very targeted in how you're acquiring customers and you have to be targeted about how you're working in identifying what segment they're in and what matters to them so that you can actually get the growth that you want to get. So, it isn't an easy thing. It is a scalable business for sure, but our experience has been that the team's ability to build the capabilities, learn, and have high-quality growth, limits you at about 20% in many cases. And we've seen that through 
David Manthey: That's very, very helpful. Thank you. I guess, again, fairly sizable investment in that business this year. As we go forward, just how do we think about SG&A growth in that business. At this point, is it principally advertising analytics spend, or is there -- do we need any additional, kind of physical assets there? Just how we think about SG&A growth in Endless Assortment?
D.G. Macpherson : Yeah. I would say -- I would have different answers to MonotaRO and Zoro. Zoro, it's mostly around marketing data analytics systems. They've built much of their own system infrastructure now they continue to invest in systems.  The investments aren't huge physical assets in Minoterie, we have that plus you have given their growth and their size, they're going to be investing in the next 3 to 4 years, 5 years in pretty significant distribution center efforts as well. While we don't talk about that much, they have been exceptional actually building physical assets to serve their customers and they have more of those investments that they will make over the next 3 to 4 years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning, guys. Well, just a first question on I guess kind of the competitive benefit of just having a better supply chain and some of your smaller competitors. How do you go about ensuring that the share you've picked up on that converts at some reasonable level to something permanent and like?  It just means you can point to in the past, maybe even the pandemic-related stuff in terms of like converting those marginal customers or stop by customers and something more structural like, how is -- what's your approach been like on that?
D.G. Macpherson : Yeah, it's a great question. I think the reality is that when you are out served customers that becomes a pretty sticky growth. It always has been in our business. And so, when you're able to have better service than the market in general, typically you see a fairly long-time horizon when you can continue to grow.  Right now, I'd say our customers are having all conversations with us about the sustainability of the supply chain, and how we can leverage our capabilities to help them grow into the future. It certainly doesn't feel like this is a one and done advantage. It feels like people are trying to figure out how to make sure that they can function really effectively going forward, or having all conversations about how to help customers lower their processing costs, improve their inventory management, the core things that we typically work on with customers we are really engaged with right now.  So, I would just say that we feel like certainly there'll be some of this -- we talked about that last year, having pandemic products, some of our very outsized share growth last year was not going to repeat. But the 475-basis point per year share growth feels like that's repeating. And it feels like it's sustainable in terms of the volume that we've captured as sustainable.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then I appreciate the color on the inventory repricing and above one-for-one or matching that in real - time, not a lot of temporary benefits. But maybe just looking at the other side of the equation with some bigger customers on contract, how are you keeping up with the price cost equation there? Is it getting a little bit more kind of exotic with things like surcharges? And then what are you anchoring that sort of stuff to? Because inflation feels a little bit more unusual than just like pay steel is higher, everything is higher and not every product category has the same pain points. So how are you managing with that, when customers that are maybe on a bit more long - term contracts or tend to be a little bit more inflexible on price?
D.G. Macpherson : Dee, do you want to take that or let me --
Dee Merriwether: Yes. I was about to jump in Sorry. I'm not seeing a big difference between customers. I would say at this point, I think especially during this time our product availability is really what is at the forefront of some of our relationships, whether you are midsize, large local or large contracts. In addition to the things that D.G just noted related to the way we serve customers in a multichannel way, right now, I think there's also boarding very well for us.  In addition to how easy it is for them to find the products on our website, which time is money for a lot of these customers. Right now, they are dealing with a lot of challenges, like we are experiencing, and I think that availability is what's really making the big difference. Even for large contract customers, there is some inflexibility in some pricing, but we do have more flexibility right now than I would say we've had of late.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your questions.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Wanted to ask a short-term question and then a more strategic question. But last quarter, you were pointing towards the low and the margin range anyway. Now you're pointing towards the low-to-midpoint.  So, I'm just curious. I think I know the answer, but I'd be curious D.G, Dee, what's changed from your perspective from July to now? And I'm specifically interested in whether pricing has been stronger, whether the retention on pricing has been stronger, that surprise is the upload.
Dee Merriwether: You just said it there at the end, Q3 was better than what we expected. We had improved mix and improved price, and that favorability of flooring through the full-year EPS for us. And revenue, that volume coming through with that price was better than what we expected.  And so just to reiterate the total Company expectations, we've  that through to talk to you about where we expect to be on a four-year basis, Revenue being stronger and so then we said that we're going to be at the midpoint of the range there. And then for everything else, I reiterated that at least with these results, that we would be low end up to the midpoint. We've tried to pull in the improvement that we saw in Q3.
Nigel Coe: And the pricing part of that question is that being surprisingly good?
Dee Merriwether: Yes, price realization is better than we would have expected at this point.
Nigel Coe: Okay, that's great. And then the medium-sized customer growth market share gain strategy, the inside sales will be a very important part of that strategy alongside the repriced initiatives. So just curious, maybe just give us an update, DG, on what's happening with the inside sales force and some of the metrics around that and whether you've been investing in that capability.
D.G. Macpherson : Sure. I would say that inside sales have -- have had a really nice bounce - back this year. They cover ed customers last year, obviously, some of which have been struggling. But we've seen a really nice revenue path with inside sales. One thing I would point out is that during the pandemic, we have been fairly locked in our coverage. And the reason is we wanted the relationships to be stable as customers went through the pandemic.  And so, we haven't invested a lot more, and we haven't invested any less. In inside sales, we consider it to be an important part of our future, and we've liked the results we've had. But given the pandemic, we haven't really changed coverage anywhere during the pandemic. We're talking about adding some coverage, potentially in the future. But we'll talk about that as we head into the future. But so far, it's been a very stable and nice growth path for us this year. The inside sales team.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Patrick Baumann: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one is on Zoro gross margin. I thought that the view here was that Zoro was going to face some mix headwinds over time from more third-party products. And I could see the skews have gone up a lot in that area. Is that still the case? Or is this like shifts in customer channel enough to offset that such that gross margin there can actually improve?
D.G. Macpherson : Well, yeah. I mean, I think what you saw is that the shifts we've made in terms of how we're acquiring customers and focusing on acquiring really strong business customers, has helped gross margin more than the third-party shipping has had it.  Third-party shipping will be a small drag we think over the next several years, as it becomes a bigger portion of the mix, but we still think we've got ways to continue to improve gross margin. We've seen that this year in the hold, whole gross margin closer to steady moving forward.
Patrick Baumann: How biggest is third-party shipping now as a percentage of mix, or whatever?
D.G. Macpherson : What's that?
Patrick Baumann: As a percentage of scales, I guess or wherever you want to talk about?
D.G. Macpherson : It's a growing portion of sales. I don't think we typically talked about that number. We'll probably talk about that at the end of the year when we talk about the path moving forward.
Patrick Baumann: And then a quick one on receivables. Can you just talk about the comment in the release about like that $268 million of growth being driven by growth in credit sales? Is that a change in how things are normally done? I just -- I'm asking because I don't recall seeing that language from you before. Maybe I've missed it.
Dee Merriwether: Yeah, it's not a change. It's just in relation to the fact that our sales are up and as a result of that, that's driving accounts receivable up as well.
Patrick Baumann: Okay, great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please state your questions.
Michael Mc Ginn: Hey, just a quick one for me. Do the majority of your contract’s re-price at a certain time like calendar year-end or are they're kind of staggered throughout the year? And what percentage of your contracts have yet to reset at the new pricing?
D.G. Macpherson : Contracts can be of different durations. They can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years. I'd say 3 years is a more common version. But in general, when we set contracts, we set specific times, multiple times a year, when we can alter price either up or down based on market Conditions. So most of our contracts have the ability to reset price multiple times during the year. 3 times a year is the most common number of times you can reset price.
Michael Mc Ginn: Thanks.
End Of Q&A :
Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to A - D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson : Great. Well, thanks everybody for joining us, we really appreciate it. Hopefully you can tell we feel good about the quarter, but more importantly, I think we feel good about how we're growing, how we're gaining share, our ability to navigate the supply chain issues, and still continue to invest in core initiatives that we think are going to be important to our long-term success. So, we feel really good about the path forward as well. Wish all of you a safe Halloween, and look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference; all parties may disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger’s second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning’s call will focused on adjusted results, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release. Now I’ll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today I’ll provide an overview of our second quarter results and progress toward our goals as the economy recovers. Before we get into details on the quarter, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting our Grainger Edge framework. Two years ago, we launched this framework that defines who we are, why we exist, and where we're going. It covers our purpose, aspiration, strategy and the principles that drive our actions. It all starts with our purpose. We keep the world working. We shared this with all team members across the company in 2019, while the concepts weren’t new and many were already part of our operational DNA, the framework provided clarity on who we are and what we do, as well as a common language for our team members. The Grainger Edge has guided us through the pandemic, and I'm proud of how the Grainger team has continued to embrace it. It's also been a strong foundation for how we serve our customers and helped us through the challenges of the last 18 months. Speaking of challenges, 2021 has provided plenty. The year has been characterized by strong demand, but a very challenging supply chain environment. Raw material shortages, labor shortages and transportation challenges have been the norm particularly in the second quarter. These challenges are industry-wide. And while we're not immune to them, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our scale and navigate through these ongoing difficulties. Importantly, this year, the supply chain has become a competitive sport. And while we've had obstacles and things are messier than normal, our customer research suggests we are navigating the obstacles well and providing very strong relative service during this time. We are actively leveraging our network. For example, for a customer located in New York, we would typically fulfill their entire order from our Northeast DC. Due to supply constraints or product delays, now part of the order may only be available in Louisville. In this case, the order may be fulfilled from Louisville, adding an extra day and incremental cost to the order. But we are able to leverage our network to provide and protect our great service. We are also leveraging our branches for more shipping in this environment. In addition, we have accelerated the ramp of our Louisville DC, which has helped alleviate capacity constraints. This building is a great asset for Grainger, and will continue to ramp capacity through the next 18 months. The good news is that we still have very high availability in our network even if the product comes from an alternate location. I've had the opportunity to be in the field quite a bit this past quarter and have been excited to spend time with the customers and hear their feedback. I'm hearing consistently that while we may be delivering a bit differently than the past, we are serving our customers better than the competition. We have validated this feedback on our recent customer service and a vast majority said we were doing better than distributors right now. We are also investing on non-pandemic inventory and partnering closely with our suppliers to work through any supply constraints, inbound lead time challenges and any potential cost increases. Additionally, shortage in the labor market have had a significant impact for all companies this year. In response, we have increased our wages to attract and retain talent, especially in our distribution centers. We've implemented robust training programs to onboard new team members and train existing team members to work throughout our buildings. We have made great progress in closing staff and gaps and will continue to do so over the third quarter. Finally, transportation has been very challenging. That is clearly linked to the product and labor shortages. While we have always prioritized optimal routes and cost efficiencies, over the last few months, we have partnered with our carriers in new ways to ensure we are meeting customer expectations. We have also added new partners to our carrier mix to handle our volume and provide us flexibility. It's important to note that the overall freight market is volatile and uncertain. While we are confident in our current plans to manage these challenges, there are a lot of moving pieces and constraints across all modes, parcel, LTL and ocean freight. For example, the ocean freight market has been uncertain as the pandemic surges again in Asia and container costs fluctuate. We are ready to respond to any of these dynamics. We expect the supply chain challenges to last through the end of the year and likely well into next year. I have no doubt, as we continue to live the Grainger Edge and follow our principles, we'll not only get through these challenges, but will deliver strong results and take market share. Turning to our financial highlights. The bottom line is that our performance has been in line with our expectations and what we communicated on our last earnings call. The only exception that this has been gross profit impacted primarily by the changes in May to the CDC mask guidelines halfway through the quarter. Heading into the second quarter, all external factors were pointing to a reopening in the U.S. around or sometime after the 4th of July, giving us a full quarter to sell through as much of our remaining pandemic inventory as possible. Based on our internal scenario planning, we thought that potential adjustments in Q2 would fall somewhere between $45 million and $50 million. We shouldn’t predict precisely how the demand curve has fall and when. Then when a CDC mass guidance change in mid-May, we saw demand for pandemic product especially in mask declined rapid. As a result of the sudden weakening in demand, we had more pandemic inventory remaining than expected, and we took a $63 million adjustment, about $15 million more than our internal scenario planning. We believe this completes, any material pandemic related inventory adjustments. Without this incremental changed we would have been roughly flat sequentially. We understand the CDC has just changed guidance again this week. While the situation is fluid, we do not expect any material change in our outlook as a result of this change. Shifting to the other financial results. We achieved strong organic daily sales growth of 15% for the company on a constant currency basis within our guided range. When compared to 2019, Q2 was up about 14% on a daily organic basis, a positive indicator of our strong performance and recovery beyond the pandemic. Our High-Touch Solutions North America segment grew 12.7% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we lapped the most extreme volatility of 2020. Looking at the 2-year average in the second quarter of 2021, we drove approximately 275 basis points of average market outgrowth. We remain very confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. We expect the volatility of 2020 and 2021 to average out and get back to normal heading into 2022. Our Canadian business drove positive operating earnings growth for the quarter and managed expense as well. We are seeing continued momentum in targeted end markets, especially heavy manufacturing and higher education as schools prepare to reopen in the fall. And we continue to diversify the business beyond natural resources. The Endless Assortment model had another impressive quarter with 23.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis, fueled by strong customer acquisition. Lastly, we generated $269 million in operating cash flow and achieved strong ROIC of 29. 2%. Turning to our quarterly results for the company. I've discussed most of what's on this slide, but I wanted to point out two additional items. First, our SG&A was $790 million, in line with the guided range provided on our first quarter call. As expected, we increased SG&A for the quarter as we continue to invest in marketing and in our people through increased variable compensation and wage rates in the DCs. This resulted in total company operating margin of 10.4%, down 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $15 million incremental inventory adjustment, GP would have been roughly flat sequentially and have been roughly flat sequentially and operating margin would have been 10.9%. Resulting EPS would have been around $4.50. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on our two segments. Dee?
Dee Merriwether: Thanks D.G. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 13.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 9.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth in our non-pandemic product category with product mix returning to more normal levels. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 36.9%, down 125 basis points versus the prior year. I think it's important to note that without the $63 million of inventory adjustment, GP would have been up 125 basis points year-over-year. This 250 basis point swing demonstrates that our underlying GP rate would have otherwise been a healthy 39.4%. Coupled with our focus on achieving price/cost neutrality, we are confident that our run rate GP remains strong. SG&A in the segment ramped as expected to $640 million, lapping the lowest point of SG&A spend in the second quarter of 2020. Canada continue to make solid progress and expanded operating margins, approximately 315 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last quarter, we have included a chart with details on the U.S. and the Canadian businesses on the first page of the appendix. On Slide 10 ,looking at pandemic product trends, I want to highlight two things before we dive into the Q2 numbers. First, we left the extreme growth experience last year and saw decreased demand for PPE products. Accordingly, pandemic sales declined approximately 28% versus 2020. However, that's an impressive 27% increase versus 2019. We estimate July 2021 will be down about 28% over July 2020, in line with what we saw in the second quarter of this year. More importantly, we see the trend in our non-pandemic sales as a positive sign of economic recovery. During the quarter, we grew 31% versus 2020 and up 7% versus 2019. We're seeing end markets like commercial, which include our severely disrupted customers in hospitality, along with heavy manufacturing, make a significant comeback. We estimate that for the month of July 2021, non-pandemic sales growth of about 22%. As it relates to pandemic product mix, while we expected it to taper off to near pre-pandemic levels to about 20% by year-end, we're seeing this happen more quickly now at about 22% of sales. In total, our U.S. High Tech Solutions business is up about 12% for the second quarter of 2021 and up 10% over 2019. Looking at market outgrowth on slide 11, we are lapping the highest concentration of large pandemic purchases of the prior year. At this time, the market declined between 14% and 15% and we saw outsized share gains of roughly 1,200 basis points. For Q2 2021, we're seeing the opposite effect. We estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 18.5% and 19.5%. The U.S. High-Touch business grew 12.4%, about 650 basis points lower than the market. To normalize for the volatility, we calculated the two-year average share gain to be 275 basis points over the market. There's some noise in the market number because across industrials, given the dynamics and fluctuations over the last two years. Therefore, the 2-year average is a better estimate of what's really going on. As I previously noted, our U.S. High-Touch business is up 10% over 2019. As the impact of the pandemic subside, coupled with our coupled with our strong progress on key initiatives, and our return on investments like marketing, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our share gain goals. Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. As previously discussed, our second quarter GP decline resulted from the $63 million inventory adjustment. This adjustment lowered U.S. GP by 270 basis points. Without this, our underlying U.S. GP rate is 39.8% in the second quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, it is important to note, we are operating in a very challenging and fluid environment. We're doing everything within our control to exit the year with a Q4 GP rate at/or above the Q1 2020 levels or 40.1%. We remain confident in our ability to achieve this target for a few reasons. First, as noted earlier, we anticipate no further material pandemic related inventory adjustments. Excluding the inventory impact, our GP rate is nearing this level already. As we discussed on slide 10, our pandemic product mix is close to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this to fully normalize in the second half. And we've seen evidence that we can continue to maintain price/cost neutrality. On the cost side, we have a robust process to partner with our suppliers and understand the specific raw material impacts as well as other conditions that may result in increased costs. As it relates to price, our goal is to continue to maintain competitiveness in the market and pass what is applicable. In the first half, we were slightly above neutrality. And as we expect to take additional price increases in the second half to offset what we're expecting in costs. Even in this inflationary environment, we are confident we will be able to execute and achieve neutrality through the remainder of the year. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 23% or 23.9% on a constant currency basis driven by continued strength in new customer acquisitions at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as growth of larger enterprise customers in MonotaRO. We did had 75 basis points year over year, driven by positive trends and both businesses and operating margins finished up 95 basis points over the prior year. I'll go into more detail on the next slide, as we provide further transparency on the results of both of these businesses  Moving to Slide 14, please remember that MonotaRO is a public company, and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclose will differ somewhat from MonotaRO’s public statements.  In local currency, and using Japan's local selling days which occasionally different from U.S. selling days, MonotaROs daily sales grew 16.7%. of GP finishing the quarter at 26.4%, 25 basis points above the prior year. Operating margin decreased 15 basis points to 12% as they continue to ramp up operations at the Ibaraki DC. Again, another strong quarter for MonotaRO. Switching to Zoro U.S., daily sales grew 32.6% as it laps its softest quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 95 basis points to 31.5% and achieved 320 basis points of operating margin expansion through substantial SG&A leverage in the quarter. All in all, very impressive results. Moving to Slide 15. In addition to the strong financial performance, we're seeing positive results with our key operating metrics. As you saw in the first quarter, we've listed total registered users for both businesses, an important driver of top line performance. Both MonotaRO and Zoro have shown progress and are up over 20% over the second quarter last year. On the right, Zoro continues to actively add skews to the portfolio. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, we had a total of 7.5 million skews available online. Closer. Our goal was 8 million for the year. We remain encouraged by our progress with SKU additions beyond traditional MRO. Now I'll provide commentary as it relates to the upcoming quarter and our expectations for the full year. For the third quarter, on a total company level, we expect our revenue growth to be between 10% and 11% on a daily organic basis. We believe any material pandemic-related inventory adjustments are complete, and we expect GP to be up between 100 and 120 basis points year-over-year and to improve sequentially. SG&A is anticipated to fall between $805 million and $815 million as we continue to invest in marketing and wages in the DCs to remain competitive. Transitioning to our total company guidance, I'd like to provide some brief commentary on how we're trending so far. We expect strong sales to continue, while GP operating margin and EPS will face pressure as a result of the incremental inventory adjustments and freight costs, along with increased DC wages and marketing. While we are maintaining our guidance, we expect results to trend towards the low end of our range with the exception of revenue. We expect revenue to be near the midpoint. As it relates to our segment operating margins, we think that some of the supply chain challenges as well as the first half inventory adjustment will weigh more heavily on the High-Touch Solutions segment, and therefore, High-Touch operating margin may trend at the low end of the range. At the same time, we believe Endless Assortment, driven by strong performance and improving margins may end the year at the high end, both helping to support delivery of total company results. We are not adjusting guidance as we are confident in our ability to deliver results within our guidance ranges. As we learn more, we'll continue to keep you apprised of any changes. With that, I'll turn it back over to. D.G. for some closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up questions, I wanted to share two recent company accomplishments. First, I'm proud to announce that earlier this month, Grainger was certified as A Great Place to Work, a true testament to the exceptional team member experience we've built and an important milestone in advancing the Grainger Edge. Second is our 10th year of publicly reporting our ESG efforts. I wanted to share highlights from our new corporate responsibility report. At Grainger, we embrace our obligation to operate sustainably and with a long-term fact based view of critical issues regarding the environment, society at large, and corporate governance. For example, in 2012, we became the first industrial distributed publicly disclose our carbon footprint. In 2013 we became the first in our industry to set a public greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, which we achieved two years early. We just set a new goal last year to reduce the absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. We're also committed to helping our customers achieve their ESG goals through our products and services. We now offer more than 100,000 environmentally-friendly products. Through this portfolio, we're able to help customers maintain sustainable facilities, the efficient energy management, water conservation, waste reduction, and improved indoor air quality. In 2017, Grainger signed the Chicago Network Equity Pledge focused on achieving 50% representation of women in leadership positions by 2030. And this year, we formed the ESG Leadership Council, which I Chair. The council is comprised of Grainger leaders who provide strategic direction and oversight on our ESG efforts. You can find the new report at graingeresg.com. With that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Christopher Glynn: Good morning. Congratulation on no adjustments, rare thing these days. Curious on the large customer contracts, you talked about having good price cost trends overall. Just curious how that works with the large customer contracts.
D.G. Macpherson: Dee, why don't you take that one?
Dee Merriwether: Sure. So as we've discussed in the past, we have about 70% of our business in the U.S. with large customers, and that business runs through their contracts. We have the right to pass on price increases to those customers at different times in the year. And so as you can imagine, our cost increases coming in from our suppliers and the timing of when we can pass on price increases to those contract customers do not always line up perfectly. So it ends up having some lumpiness as it relates to GP. But overall, those actions that we're taking with those customers are going well. And we have been able to pass on cost increases to those customers. I'd also like to remind you that the rest of the business, about 30% is on a wet price, which we have the ability to change in line with the market. And we do that to remain competitive with others in the market that have visible prices.
D.G. Macpherson: The only thing I'd add to that, Chris, and thanks for the question, is that we have a very - as Dee said, a very robust process in terms of managing costs. This is an environment right now where everybody is raising price on everything. And we are effectively working with our suppliers to mitigate the cost. And so the conversations with customers are well-understood and expected at this point. So I would say if we continue to do both of those things well, we feel like we can be in good shape.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Thanks for that. And on the guidance, kind of, separately heard at the low end in the slide, and then towards the low end. I don't know about other people, I read those a little bit differently. Just want to clarify your intent?
Dee Merriwether: So I think if you go back to our prepared remarks, we expect revenue to remain strong and fall within the range. And while GP operating margin and EPS will be pressured primarily due to some of the inventory adjustments that we have taken this year, we're happy to be back past that. But because of that, and some other pressures related to some wage increases and things like that that D.G. noted, we will - we're saying now that GP operating margin and EPS will fall at the lower end of the guidance range that we provided in the first quarter. So we are maintaining our guidance and giving color related to revenue, GP, operating margins and EPS.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your question.
Chris Snyder: So the company has demonstrated a pathway to get back to pre-pandemic gross margin, and when we see the inventory adjustments, we're almost already there. But I guess what's the outlook for either 2022, or 2022 and beyond once we get back there? Is the expectation that we can get to pre-pandemic levels and hold it? or should we expect moderation thereafter on competition? Or is there an opportunity to improve it, given what we're seeing with outgrowth from midsized customers?
D.G. Macpherson: So thanks for the question. I think if you step back, I think we find that comparisons to 2019 or early 2020 are probably better than last year at this point because there's so much messages in the year-over-year numbers. But our general thinking is, we will exit the year with having gained significant share and in a better spot from an economic perspective with similar GP and better SG&A leverage. And that's kind of the model going forward. We feel like we're priced competitively. We feel like we can hold GP in each of our business units fairly consistently over time and get some SG&A leverage. And so our whole model is based on consistent share gain and slightly expanding operating margins. Typically, we would expect GP to hold relatively flat as a percentage moving forward with some SG&A leverage.
Chris Snyder: I appreciate that. And then I wanted to follow up on the U.S. 2-year outgrowth, which fell to 275 bps a bit below the 300 to 400 the company was targeting. Is there anything specific there to call out? Or is that just quarter-to-quarter lumpiness? And then I guess what gives you confidence that we'll get back into that 300, 400 bp range, at least on a multiyear basis into the back half and then thereafter?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. For the year, we're still within our expectation. Now I would say, just to be frank, a lot of the comparisons, we had the market growing 18% to 19% in the second quarter. It's tough to find sort of any peers that have grown that way. Relative to peers, we think we're doing good. And we look at both our own metric, which is based on industrial production, and we look at peers. And so we feel very strong about our performance. We also feel and the returns we're seeing. We're tracking everything, and we feel very good. We think right, what you're seeing for the second quarter is a lot of messiness in metrics and pandemic-driven sort of ups and downs. But through cycle, we're very confident we're going to be able to achieve our target.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Deane Dray: And I also join Chris in saying it's great to see that you did flow through that inventory write-down through your operating results. So we appreciate the transparency there. And just - and D.G., you did say this is a fluid environment. We recognize that, and there are some regions that are going to return to mask mandates. Would there be any potential scenario where this inventory could eventually be sold? So are you still carrying that inventory? Because I think the way the accounting works, it would be sold at all profits since you've now taken the costs out. Is that the correct understanding?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So to be clear, our accounting for the quarter was what happened at the end of the quarter and through a couple of weeks after that when we actually put the results together, working with our team and our external accountants. And we just follow our process, the mask change that happened in a last couple of days, I will say that every single external announcement in the pandemic has driven behavior. So we are expecting in the short term to get some increased mask sales. We haven't flown that through. You're right, there's a potential, but it's so early, 48 hours' worth of revenue wouldn't give us any indication. And things are so fluid and change so fast, it's really hard to tell. Obviously, if we went into full lockdown with full mask usage, what you described could in fact could in fact be true. But it's just really uncertain right now.
Deane Dray: Of course, I appreciate that. And then I may have missed the explanation, but MonotaRO, the margin pressure this quarter was the 15 basis points. Is that pandemic related? What's the explanation there?
D.G. Macpherson: I think Dee talked about it. But basically, starting at the [Rocky] DC, which was an expected cost is a big part of that. So, given their growth, they have put significant investments in the distribution centers and that has added some costs. They're still very, very profitable and still seeing very good growth relative to what has been a pretty challenging market in Japan.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey, your line is open, please unmute yourself.
David Manthey: First off, I'm trying to understand the guidance as you put it to the low end, not the lower end of the range. When I run the numbers here, if I'm doing this right, $15 million is maybe $0.20 after-tax and relative to $1.50 range. I mean, if you're originally at the midpoint, now you're maybe $0.1950 something, I'm just wondering that excluding this write-down, have your expectations for the second half changed in the past 90 days? I know you said it's fluid, but it seems like to immediately go to the low end of the range seems a little bit much relative to the inventory adjustment that was unexpected.
Dee Merriwether: Yes, I'll start and then maybe D.G. can add on if he wants to add any more color. A couple of things have happened since the last time we talked. And we talked about it in our prepared remarks related to the messiness of the market and industry supply chain challenges, being able to make sure that we can hire and retain the right people in our DCs, which is critical to our business. And so we're seeing some labor inflation that wasn't projected at that time. So, that plays into it additional marketing spend to continue to focus on our brand and improve our web conversion with our customers as well. So, we talked about some of those things in our stated remarks as well. And so again, we're guiding to the low end of the range as it relates to that plus the inventory actions we've taken.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ryan Merkel: My first question is on freight. How much will freight hurt margins in 2021? And then how are the conversations going with customers where you're asking some of them to pay freight where they have been getting free freight in the past?
Dee Merriwether: So, starting last year, as you can imagine trying to work through somewhere north 2,000 type customers with conversations with large customers. Those conversations have been going well. But there's two things I think you have to take into account. Either there are some freight rate changes that have come from some visible partners that are easier to talk through. And so those things have gone extremely well and continue to go well. So, no problems up to this point with being able to pass on some freight costs to our customers.
D.G. Macpherson: I would add, Ryan, there's a number of factors. One is freight rates. The other is just the service challenges, and we are - we've certainly added some costs. We are going to recoup certainly some of that, if not all of that. But just to be able to make sure that we have delivery assurance they can actually get product to customers right now is not as trivial as it historically has been. So we're having to prioritize loads more than we've ever prioritized loads, containers coming from Asia or the cost is way, way up. And that, trying to avoid taking too much cost increase while still providing great service. So it's challenging. And certainly, there's some uncertainty. We do think that ultimately, it will balance out. But for right now, it's relatively chaotic in the freight market.
Ryan Merkel: And then for my follow-up, just a question on gross margins. It sounds like you expect neutral price cost in the second half for the High-Touch business, at least. So I'm just curious, how much confidence can we have in that? I mean it's a crazy environment right now. Would you say there's sort of above average risk versus normal that there could be some downside? Or do I have it wrong and you feel pretty confident based on what you know?
D.G. Macpherson: I would say, and Dee can add to this if she'd like. I would say we're pretty confident in that. We've actually had conversations through the summer with most of our suppliers about cost expectations, and we've already been managing those negotiations and getting to a place that we think makes sense. And we have we have price set for some increases in the back half of the year. So, most of that is already set. There are surprises that happen and are likely to happen this year. But typically, we're able to manage those and either push those out or find ways to mitigate those. So we're pretty confident that we're going to be within that sort of price cost neutrality range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Nigel Coe: Just a bit more detail on the 3Q guide. I think this is for Dee. So I think you said 110 or so basis points of gross margin expansion Q-to-Q, so that gets us flat year-over-year. Number one, is that correct? And I think the comment was 4Q exit rate kind of consistent with 1Q '20. It feels like that's now pushing to the right, just maybe confirm that? And the final comment, the SG&A in 3Q, the 810, it seems like your full year guidance seems that, that committee go it bit higher in 4Q. Is that the right way to read it? Thanks.
Dee Merriwether: Yes. So if you look at - I think I'll start with your question just around the gross profit for our total company, the guide was that we expect that to be up 100 to 120 basis points. And so that's really being driven by a little bit of the conversation we just had. Achieving price/cost neutrality, we're slightly above neutrality through the first half, but we think that we're going to maintain that and be neutral for the full year. And we believe that because of the pricing actions, as D.G. noted, that we expect to continue to take, our cost rigor with our supply base, gives us confidence in what we've been able to do up to this point this year. And as it relates to SG&A, the range of 8.05 to 8.15 is pretty solid in our mind on a go-forward basis, and it looks similar for Q4.
Nigel Coe: And then longer term, the customer base is, for both the MonotaRO and Zoro are now very similar. The ARPU is 2x for MonotaRO versus Zoro. I understand MonotaRO is a much more mature business. Is there any reason why Zoro kind of ARPU can't get closer to MonotaRO overtime?
D.G. Macpherson: You're talking about operating earnings, Nigel?
Nigel Coe: I'm talking about revenue per customer.
D.G. Macpherson: Revenue per customer.
Nigel Coe: Right.
D.G. Macpherson: Got you.
Nigel Coe: Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: So there's a couple of things that will make that be different going forward. And I would expect MonotaRO to have much higher sales per customer. One is, in the Japanese market, there is no industrial distributors - broadline industrial distributors like there are in the U.S. that direct to customer. So, actually, the MonotaRO business is starting to build a pretty strong enterprise customer solution, and they're having some success there. We don't expect Zoro to do that, because the competition in the U.S. is much more stiff on that front. And so, they have some larger customers that Zoro doesn't have. Zoro is focused on that small business more fully and really focused there. So I think that's probably the primary difference, and I would expect that difference to continue. We expect the growth rates to be strong in both businesses, and we expect the margins to improve to high single digits in Zoro over the next couple of years. And so, we feel like it's a great story. But I would expect that metric to be slightly different.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please, go ahead.
Tommy Moll: Just wanted to follow up on the point you just made about the continued margin progression for Zoro. Your leverage at the operating income line in the second quarter was impressive. Can you take us through some of the drivers there? And then looking forward, how sustainable some of those might be?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. We think they're very sustainable. So just as a sort of reminder, we made - a couple of years back, we made pretty significant investments to give that business more independence. And there were really two types of investments being made. One was in systems to allow them to have their own - for example, their own product management system. So they're pretty much clean now, in terms of their own systems infrastructure. And the second one is, building teams that could do things like add millions and millions of products a year, improving their marketing and data analytics capabilities, improving their IT team. A lot of those were one-time investments. And now, as we grow, we're starting to see the leverage and we expect to see that leverage moving forward. We feel like the GP is in a good place, and we think that price points are in a good place. So we don't see concerns there. And we just see a role where we can continue to grow the business fairly quickly and leverage the investments that we've made.
Tommy Moll: Following up on your High-Touch business for the gross margin trajectory versus what you talked about a quarter ago. It sounds like there's some incremental marketing spend that's in the budget now. What were the factors that changed over the last 90 days where you decided to go ahead and lean in heavier there? And as you look forward to Q4, does it feel like - or I should say, to just the rest of the year? Does it feel like you've now got pretty good grip on what the budget looks like? Or could it shift higher again potentially?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. We've got a really good handle on what the budget is going to look like on marketing. We just look at returns on a periodic basis, and the returns we're getting were really strong, And we had some - we've been running a number of tests and those tests came back positive. Some did not. But the ones that came back positive, we decided to push on. And so that's what drove that incremental money.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Josh Pokrzywinski: So, D.G., just on kind of your own kind of commercial initiatives getting out in front of customers, things like that with the markets being little bit more open to receptive, how do you expect some of those outgrowth metrics to sort of snap back from here? I know that there's some - a bit of a contortion in the metric right now because of the pandemic sales stuff. But are you able to kind of commercialize or get out in the field more than you were 90 days ago? And is that kind of bearing any fruit here in the medium term?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So, it's a great question. The answer is yes, we're getting out to our customers more. If our customers are accepting visits from us, we are going would be the answer to that question. I would say that the vast majority are. And as you know, our service team members have been there every day of the pandemic, basically. We've been able to visit customers to fill inventory bins and do the things that we do on from a servicing side. But in terms of customer discussions, we are pretty much running like normal. There's some customers that don't allow visits, but I've been in front of probably 10 to 15 customers in the last six, seven weeks. And those conversations feel very normal, and we're talking about how to expand the business, really leveraging the work we've done to help them stay up and running in the pandemic and keep their people safe to try to improve the relationship and grow. And I think that's going to be a positive story moving forward.
Josh Pokrzywinski: And then I guess sort of related to that, I think there's a whole litany of end markets and business activities that are sort of post-COVID change. Is it - whether it's a customer group or end market, where do you see sort of the biggest difference in that interaction, someone buying differently, wanting you to handle a bigger scope of what they're doing? Because I would imagine that we go through 2020 and even early 2021 and the recovery, everyone is just sort of too busy to make big sleeping structural changes, but maybe now with maybe the smoke clearing a bit more. Anything you've seen out there where someone used to said, here's how we're running this process differently. Again, it could be an end market, could be kind of a customer practice, but just curious high level where you guys have seen the biggest change.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, I think the customer changes or trend changes, there are two I would point to. One is the pandemic did teach a lot of our customers that having a digital solution is pretty important. And the other is having an inventory solution is pretty important. And so almost every conversation you have with customers now centers on how can we install processes so that it's really easy to order and that we can help them manage inventory and keep inventory levels where they need to be. Those are the two biggest changes. Those are really across all customers. Obviously, there's differences by segment. There are still some segments that are pretty significantly disrupted and some that are ranging. But I think from a customer interest standpoint, helping them manage their inventory and getting on the right digital solution are the two things that are even more intense even though they've always been important, they're really intent right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Michael McGinn: Thank you. I just wanted to go back to the SG&A and digital marketing that you were discussing earlier. If I'm looking at the Q3 guidance, SG&A is going to take a 15% up-tick year-over-year here, and that is about 500 bps greater than the sales growth you're guiding to. Can you just give us an update on what the structural SG&A savings that were discussed last quarter? And how much of that is going to roll into 2022 and what those initiatives look like?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, first, and I'll turn it over to Dee. I think that we expect to have better SG&A leverage in the third quarter than we do in the second quarter, but I'll turn it over to Dee to talk about the details.
Dee Merriwether: Yes, I'd agree. So when we talked about, at the highest level, daily revenue expectation of 10 to 11 in Q3 that implies SG&A leverage will improve and so we expect that. But again, we just talked about the fact that we are going to continue to invest in marketing spend as well as continue to see some uptick in the full quarter's worth of the - some of the DC labor changes and transportation changes that have happened. We are working on a number of mitigating factors to continue to see how much we can offset that over time. But we have laid into Q3 as far as providing color and expectations that that's where we're going to get to when you take into account those increases.
Michael McGinn: And on the freight conversation, I guess my assumption is that anything small standard would go on the contract rate. You guys are probably using your legacy relationships in the new carriers. Are you pushing the nonstandard product to those new channels, because there are more market spot-based freight costs? And is this something that you're going to lean into long-term? Or how should we think about that non-standard product shipments?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, the vast majority of our shipments do go parcel. And for those, we have obviously very big contracts and contract rates. And so that is correct. In terms of alternatives right now, the LTL market is probably the most challenged from a service perspective, from a driver shortage perspective, and as a result, from a cost perspective. And so there, we've developed new solutions. We're working with some new carriers, working with some existing carriers in trying to find the right solution. That would be where it is most messy right now, I would say. The other place would be on ocean freight, which is mostly a container cost issue and a capacity issue right now, where we're prioritizing more than we ever had to make sure that we get our contracted rates and don't have to get outside those, because if you get outside of this right now, that's very expensive.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.
Justin Bergner: My first question was on the outgrowth. I realize there's some squishiness to the market growth rate upon, which your outgrowth statistic was calculated. But just generally speaking, as we think about the 300 to 400 basis point sort of outgrowth target, everything else being equal, should the supply chain challenges favor Grainger being on the high end of that range simply because you have more capabilities to meet customer demand in a supply chain-challenged environment than some of your competitive set?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I think that's absolutely right. And I think that if we didn't have sort of our distribution center capacity right now, things would be a lot more difficult finding customer solutions. So we feel like the investments we've made which have been substantial over the last 12 years to get the network we have, is really helping us now make sure we can serve customers. And we think that's giving us a pretty significant advantage in the marketplace.
Justin Bergner: And then just a question on sort of free cash flow. Is it still the case that sort of you're going to be focused on deploying the vast majority of your free cash flow to dividends and repurchases? Or has anything sort of changed there?
D.G. Macpherson: So thanks for the question. No, nothing has really changed related to our capital allocation strategy. And so we're still sticking exactly to what we have said in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Patrick Baumann: Thank you for taking my question. On the Zoro growth, I mean, it looked really strong to me in the quarter. I'm not sure what the comp was. So I'm just kind of curious if you could tell us what it looked like on a tier stack basis? And then how should we think about growth there in the second half of the year?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So I don't remember the 2-year stack number at Zoro. But what I will say is there is going to be a lot of lumpiness in every quarter-to-quarter comparison this year for reasons that mostly have to do with supply. So last year in the second quarter, we prioritized supply for healthcare and government customers of pandemic products.  And so we turned off a whole bunch of volume that Zoro probably could have sold. So Zoro did not have the kind of growth last year that certainly it was used to. In this year's, we're very pleased with the trajectory they're on. They're ahead of plan and doing very well. But this year's number in the second quarter, I wouldn't assume that that's going to be the number we see going forward because that is off of a very low number, given the supply decisions that we made last year. We still have a lot of confidence in Zoro's ability to grow 20% going forward, but there's going to be some lumpiness in the back half of the year. There's going to be bad compares. In the summer last year, we had a bunch of consumer business as we were the only ones that have product that we're going to compare against still be strong growth but may not be quite as much as you're used to seeing. That will all work its way out, and we expect very consistent strong growth in our business.
Patrick Baumann: And then my follow-up is can you remind us where your freight costs are recognized? I'm not sure, if it's inbound or outbound or different areas of the P&L or maybe part of it is - SG&A part of it in COGS. If it's in COGS when you say price cost neutrality does this include freight? And then also, does the neutrality mean keeping profits neutral or margin rate neutral? I know there was a bunch of questions in there, but I just wanted to fit them all in?
D.G. Macpherson: So the freight costs are included in GP for us. And what was the - you were talking so fast? Can you repeat the second and third question again for me? Sorry.
Patrick Baumann: Yes. So I was saying, if it's in the GP, which it is when you talk about price/cost neutrality, does this include freight in that comment? And then when you talk about price cost neutrality also, does it mean keeping profits neutral? Or is it keeping the margin rate neutral?
Dee Merriwether: So, yes. So when we talk about price cost neutrality, it doesn't include the freight portion. And then to answer the second question, we're talking about rate. GP Rate not run rate.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kevin Marek with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kevin Marek: Maybe just one on Cromwell quickly where gross margins have improved this quarter. Can you talk about what's driving that and how sustainable the improvement is? I'm kind of wondering if we should still think about Cromwell losses being halved for the full year versus last year? Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we do think Cromwell is going to roughly have losses from last year to this year. The market in Cromwell in the UK has been challenged as most people are aware. But that business has done a really nice job of improving service and starting to see some growth now, which is great. And they're starting to bounce back a little bit, and they're in a good position from a cost perspective and from a service perspective. So we still have some of our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year for how that business will shake out through the balance.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. I'll turn it back to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Great. Thanks. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I really appreciate it. The one thing I'll just leave you with is, as we think about what has been a very strange period the last 18 months, our focus is clearly on the future. And we keep saying this, but I will continue to repeat this. Our goal this period is to exit the pandemic in better shape than we started, and that means consistent share gain. We believe we will have done that, and that means having better economics as we exit, and we believe we will be there as well as we exit the year and head into, hopefully, we put the pandemic behind us, although, of course, that's no guarantee. But that is our goal. And we continue to focus on making sure we deliver a great customer experience and manage the business for long-term share gain and long-term margin expansion. So we're going to continue to do that. And we feel really good about where we're at. And so I appreciate the time, and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-30 11:00:00) =====
Company Representatives: D.G. Macpherson - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Dee Merriwether - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Irene Holman - Vice President of Investor Relations
Operator: Greetings! And welcome to the Grainger First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q1 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks Irene. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today I'll provide a brief overview of our first quarter results, key initiatives and encouraging signs for our business as the economy recovers. Of note, this will be our first quarter with results aligned to our two new reportable segments. Also as MonotaRO, our majority owned subsidiary as a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we have now aligned the timing of our earnings releases. I am very proud of the way the Grainger team has continued to serve our customers through the recovery and has addressed new challenges as they arise. We're supporting many customers through vaccination deployment, including pharmacies and other large sites. Recently we partnered with the State University Medical Center, The National Guard, and The Department of Health to support a max vaccination site. We updated the site with important pandemic related products like safety equipment, as well as more traditional MRO products needed to support the operation, like power and extension cords, lighting and traffic cones. As it ramped up, this site has been able to facilitate thousands of vaccinations a day. We're seeing vaccination distribution progressing around the world, albeit at different speeds. In the U.S. as more of the population gets vaccinated, we are seeing many customers return to the normal operations and purchasing patterns. This is evident as our non-pandemic sales continue to return to normal levels and as sales in most end markets grow sequentially. In the U.K. we are seen business activity rise. In Canada solar vaccine distribution and potential shutdowns are slowing the business recovery. We're also seeing a modestly slower recovery in Japan. No matter what stage of the recovery our customers are in, our relationships with them are very strong given our support of their operations over the past year; part of being there for our customers and having the products they needed, when they needed it. To bring this to life, at this time last year when customers needed hand sanitizer, we sold them 55 gallon drums and they were filling their own containers. As supply constraints eased, customers reverted back to purchasing more normal PPE skews and far fewer 55 gallon drums. As I said before, we took calculated risks in procuring pandemic products and reasonable alternatives, especially in the second quarter of 2020. As the pandemic progressed and market dynamics changed, we had to revalue some of our inventory in Q4 and again in Q1. We anticipate further price deterioration on some of these non-core alternative pandemic products. While our profitability on these products, including all potential write downs was below normal, supporting our customers by taking these risks was the right thing to do. We improved relationships with our existing customers, developed new repeat business and delivered strong incremental growth at lower, but still profitable margins. On last quarter's call we shared our first quarter expectations. As it relates to revenue in the first quarter, all of our businesses surpassed our outlook. We expected first quarter company GP to be down 150 to 200 basis points versus prior year, and our actual results fell within the stated range. Excluding the inventory adjustment our U.S. GP was up versus the prior year, giving us further confidence in the path forward. Based on our strong results and improving economic trends, we are providing full year guidance which Dee will discuss in a few minutes. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to make progress on our key initiatives across geographies. The U.S. is seeing positive signs of economic recovery with growth of non-pandemic sales in virtually all segments. The exception is healthcare, which has very high pandemic fuel comps. Gross margin are returning to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S., net of inventory adjustments. In Canada the path to recovery is slower as they struggle to get the virus under control. Despite this, Grainger Canada achieved its revenue and margin targets in the first quarter. The Endless Assortment segment grew over 27% as we execute the playbook and gained momentum with our strategy. The team continues to add skews beyond traditional MRO products which helps grow web traffic, our continued marketing efforts, and more targeted discounting strategies are working well and driving operating margin expansion at Zoro. Also we are gaining real traction with new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO. Finally, I'm excited to announce that MonotaRO has opened its newest distribution center in Ibaraki, Japan, which will allow the business to stock additional high demand products locally. Shifting to the financial results, we achieved organic daily sales growth of 5.9% for the total company on a comp and currency basis. In the U.S. we started to lap the volatility of 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021 we drove approximately 250 basis points of market outgrowth. To normalize for all the volatility, we look to the two year average share gains, which we believe is a more reasonable measure of outgrowth. Using this we averaged 475 basis points of annual market outgrowth from 2019 to 2021. We anticipate showing both measures going forward. Endless Assortment had strong performance in the quarter at 27.4% daily sales grow. For the total company we delivered operating margin of 11.6% with 210 basis points in adjusted SG&A leverage, more than offsetting the anticipated GP pressure from pandemic inventory adjustments. To be clear, we expect to sell through the remainder of these non-core pandemic products and complete any potential market driven inventory adjustments by the end of Q2. Finally, we generated $294 million in operating cash flow, returned $256 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and maintained strong ROIC of 30.3%. All-in-all we are very pleased with the performance and our trajectory. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Dee to take us through our first quarter results. Dee.
Dee Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. As we move to our new reportable segment, you will continue to see a total company slide then a familiar four lines P&L for both High-Touch Solutions North America and Endless Assortments. We’ll also continue to provide transparency into the U.S., Canada. MonotaRO and the Zoro U.S. business. As we lap the pandemic, we will continue to provide pandemic related data to clarify our results, especially for the U.S. Turning to our quarterly results, organic daily sales which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory and China finished up 7% and 5.9% on a constant currency basis, underpinned by growth in both segments. Note that we have one less selling day in Q1, 2021 versus Q1, 2020. At the total company level, GP was down 190 basis points. 180 basis point of this was driven by pandemic fueled inventory adjustments in the U.S., consistent with what we shared in our Q4, 2020 earnings call. We anticipated the need for adjustment. As D.G. shared, we expect to complete any potential market driven inventory adjustments by the end of the second quarter and we estimate the amount will be similar to or lower than Q1. This expectation has been factored into our GP ramp, as well as our 2021 guidance. Endless Assortment expanded gross margins overall, driven by continued improvement at Zoro, while the mix impact of growing these businesses is alluded to company gross margin. It drives incremental gross profit and earnings dollars and is an important driver for the company’s performance. SG&A of $735 million was favorable by $43 million year-over-year, in-line with our expectation shared last quarter. We captured 210 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period and continued prudent cost control in the High-Touch Solutions segment and strong expense leverage in Endless Assortment. This resulted in total company operating margin of 11.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. The business continues to produce robust cash flow with operating cash flow of $294 million, 124% of net adjusted earnings and free cash flow of $221 million. We also returned $175 million back to shareholders through repurchases and $81 million through dividends in the period. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, daily sales increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We started to lap the pandemic sales by mid-February, resulting in more challenging comparisons. In the U.S. daily sales were up 3.5%. In Canada, daily sales were up 3.3% in U.S. dollars, however still down 2.8% in local days and local currency. Canada’s decline was primarily driven by pandemic disruptions, most notably with our natural resource customer. As we diversify beyond natural resources, we are seeing improvement in our targeted end markets, including healthcare, higher education and manufacturing. For the segment GP finished the quarter at 37.4%, a sequential improvement of 30 basis points versus Q4, 2020 and down 230 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was due to the inventory adjustment to U.S. and the pandemic mix in Canada. Excluding the adjustment, U.S. GP would have been up versus prior year, which is a better indicator of expected performance moving forward. We have included a chart towards the end of this presentation which highlights the impact of the pandemic inventory adjustments in the U.S. by quarter. Finally, we continue to gain SG&A leverage with our costs down $24 million, driven by reduced travel expenses and general operating efficiency in both the U.S. and Canada. Canada expanded operating margins 110 basis points over the prior year. As a part of our commitment to providing continued transparency of our U.S. and Canadian businesses, we've included a chart with details in the appendix. Moving on to slide nine. Looking at pandemic product growth trends, we have started to lap the spike experienced in early 2020. For reference, pandemic product sales grew 41% in the first quarter of 2020. Accordingly, growth rates have eased throughout the quarter this year, growing a very modest 1% year-over-year. Pandemic mix as a percent of the total remained elevated at 25%. As a comparison point, mix was 19% in 2019 and rose to 28% for the full year of 2020. Most importantly though, on the non-pandemic side things continued to improve. We started to see year-over-year sales growth and not-pandemic product sales in March of this year, with daily sales dollars increasing sequentially each month during the quarter, with April ending up roughly 36%, the highest growth to date in 2021. This is a very encouraging sign that trends especially for customer business activity are beginning to revert to more normal levels. Looking at share gain on slide 10, we estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 0.5% to 1.5% in the first quarter, showing continued improvement as the economy recovers. We knew there will be tremendous noise in measuring share gains throughout 2021 given the extreme volatility of the prior year. Our 2020 share gain is inflated due to the pandemic. Correspondingly our 2021 share gains will be muted as we wrap the unusual sales spikes from non-repeating orders. We outgrew the market by roughly 250 basis points in the quarter as we lapped the pandemic sales spike. To eliminate the noise and better understand our market outgrowth, we’ve also provided a two year average share gain metric. While it is perfect, it does normalize activity across the two year period and provide a more reasonable view into our share gains since the end of 2019. The two year average was approximately 475 basis points, each quarter we plan to share both numbers. We think this will be especially helpful in the second quarter given the extreme volatility. We remain confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during the challenging times and to produce 300 to 400 basis point of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business. Moving to our Endless Assortment Segment, daily sales increased 27.4% or 23.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as MonotaRO’s continued pursuit of large enterprise customers in Japan. I will share some of our key growth metrics to provide further color into how we think about these businesses. GP expanded 35 basis points year-over-year driven by Zoro’s improved discounting strategies. Operating margins expanded 185 basis points due primarily to substantial SG&A leverage at Zoro. Moving to slide 12. We have provided further transparency on the results of both businesses. As you're aware, MonotaRO is a public company and as such, MonotaRO follows Japanese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or JGAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP. In Grainger’s consolidated results, we translate MonotaRO’s financials into U.S. dollars and U.S. GAAP. In addition, we continue to report MonotaRO results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclose would different somewhat from MonotaRO’s public statements. In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 25.5% with GP finishing the quarter at 26.5% in basis points below prior year. Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 12%. This is a very strong quarter for MonotaRO. We are excited for the new distribution center that will allow them to stack many of the fastest moving items locally. They also continue to make enhancements in both product information and order management systems, hoping to improve the customer search experience and delivery speed, preparing them for the future. Switching to Zoro U.S., March was our stronger average daily sales month since Zoro’s inception in 2010, with daily sales up 15.2% driven by strong customer acquisition. In addition, we drove solid SG&A leverage resulting in 370 basis points of operating margin expansion. I’d like to spend a minute on the metrics we are using to measure progress on our growth initiatives for both Zoro and MonotaRO. On the left side of the chart we've listed total registered users for both businesses. This is a long standing metric that MonotaRO has shared externally. Growing our registered user base is an important driver of top line performance and as you can see, both businesses have shown tremendous progress. Moving to the right side, Zoro is aggressively adding skew to the portfolio. Having an expansive assortment is the key factor to Zoro’s customer acquisition and growth strategy. As of Q1, 2021 we had a total of 6.7 million skews available online. We are excited by our robust top line and targeting to reach 10 million total skews by 2024. Before I discuss our full year 2021 guidance, I'd like to first provide additional color on the current quarter to help you understand what we expect as the economy recovers and our business performance improves. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for April are strong. As last April was our softest sales month of the year, we expect to grow – we expect our growth to moderate in May and June and to end the second quarter up between 14% and 15% on a daily organic basis. Note that our reported revenue growth will be about 280 basis points lower as Fabory and China, both of those businesses were divested after June of 2020. We expect Q2 company GP to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, which implies down about 30 basis points year-over-year. The pandemic impacts including inventory adjustments and mix continued to improve both sequentially and year-over-year. We are starting to see modest cost inflation, especially on some specific product categories and raw materials such as resin and steel. While the quarters may still be a bit bumpy as the timing of cost increases and price actions do not align perfectly, we expect price cost spreads to be neutral for the year. We're also starting to see general inflation in the freight market, especially in ocean freight rates and LTL shipping. In the second quarter, we expect freight shipment will be muted as we are lapping inflated prior year costs from air shipments. For SG&A, we expect to see cost step-up most notably in the second quarter as business activity resumes. Specifically, we expect increases in travel, variable compensation and merit as well as advertising spend as we take advantage of higher returns. With this, we anticipate SG&A between $780 million and $800 million for the second quarter of 2021, and to remain in this general range for the remaining quarters of the year. This will drive leverage for the full year versus both 2020 and 2019. As always, we remain focused on managing costs while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. We've learned a great deal through the pandemic and don't expect all costs to return to pre-pandemic levels moving forward. Related to U.S. GP we still expect to see improved rates as pandemic mix reverts to more normal levels and as we put non-core pandemic inventory adjustments behind us. Run rate margins are stabilizing, and we maintain our expectation that we will exit the year with U.S. GP rate as high or higher with Q1 2020 level. As a reminder, this slide relates to U.S. business. We choose to highlight it, because it represents more than 70% of the total company results, and was most heavily impacted by the pandemic. As we become more comfortable with the pace of the economic recovery primarily in the U.S., coupled with our recent performance, we are providing full year 2021 guidance and will provide updates as we move through the year. For the total company, we expect daily sales growth between 8.5% and 11% or 10% and 12.5% organically, driven by strong top line performance in both segments. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we anticipate U.S. business will grow between 7% and 9.5% based on estimated MRO market growth between 6.5% and 9%. This years’ one year market outgrowth of roughly 50 basis points and a two-year average annual outgrowth of 425 basis points; the two year average normalizes for the extreme spikes experienced in 2020 and anchors to 2019. In Canada the recovery is a bit more choppy than the U.S. with the slower vaccine rollout and recent business shut downs. With that in mind, we do expect volumes to stabilize as we move through the year. We expect endless assortment to continue growing at roughly 20% as the MonotaRO team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add skews and continue to drive greater market efficiencies at Zoro. From a profitability perspective, total company GP is expected to be between 36.1% and 36.6%, up in 2020 and 70 basis points in 2021. Both the High-Touch Solutions and Endless Assortment segments are expanding gross profit margins. However, there's a roughly 30 basis points dilutive impact to total company GP as the lower margin endless assortment of growth outpaces the High-Touch Solutions Segment. Both segments are expected to deliver high ROIC and drive GP and earnings dollars growth for the company. For High-Touch Solutions, our GP guidance incorporates the sequential improvement in the back half of the year as we move beyond the unfavorable pandemic impact and get back to more normal business operations. For the year in the U.S. we expect our price cost spread to be neutral. Total company operating margins are expected to be between 11.8% and 12.4% and expand between 50 basis points and 115 basis points versus 2020. At the midpoint we expect our operating margins will be back to 2019 levels. Operating margin improvements are expected to be driven by both GP expansion versus 2020 loans and SG&A leverage as we grow the top line, while maintaining cost discipline. These top line and profitability targets, as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program are expected to produce earnings per share between $19 and $20.50; that’s growth between 17.5% and 26.5%. Continuing with guidance on slide 17, in addition to the total company guidance, we wanted to provide some additional color by segment, as well as our plans for capital allocation. At the segment level, we expect operating margin expansion in both of our reportable segments, with margins and High-Touch Solutions between 13.2% and 13.7% and endless assortment landing between 8.8% and 9.2%. Cromwell represented in other is expected to reduce operating losses and anticipate closing the year with operating margin down approximately 7%. We expect to cut Cromwell’s losses in half and return the business to profitability in the back half of 2022. From a cash flow perspective for the year, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1 million and $1.2 million. Our capital expenditures outlook for the year remains between $225 million and $275 million. The large majority of our investment this year includes DC expansion in Japan, KeepStock enhancements in the U.S., continued IT investment and a normal level of maintenance capital. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and to continue executing against our new share repurchase authorization. For 2021 we're expecting between $600 million and $700 million of share repurchases, which continue to reflect our confidence in successfully executing our strategies and growth initiatives. And I'll close with the highlights from our dividends announced this week, representing 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, a testament to the strength and stability of our business and our commitment to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. I'm proud of the team and our results for the quarter across those segments and I'm confident in our performance moving forward. As Dee discussed, we expect to end this year having gained strong share and to be in a better profitability position than before the pandemic as we enter into 2022. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working as we get through the rest of the pandemic and back to normal operations, as well as continue to execute our strategy so we can achieve this purpose for years to come. And with that, we will open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.
Ryan Merkel: Hey! Thanks and good morning all. I guess first off, your sales outlook is encouraging and a little bit better than I was thinking. Can you put some context around the 36% non-pandemic grow for the High-Touch Business in April. I know it was an easy comp, but it feels like the macro noticeably picked up. Is that the right read?
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks Ryan for the questions. I think as we talked about this year’s comparisons for 2020 are going to be pretty closed upon given what happened this year. And so if you go back to 2019, what we see is a very consistent increase in non-pandemic relative to that 2019, and we see you know the pandemic sales continue to be elevated, but not as elevated as time goes on. And so really if you think about the revenue outlook for us, we're basically taking run rates and looking at what we think's going to happen with run rates and that gets us to the numbers we're talking about. So you don’t have to believe a lot about anything really changing in the macro versus just continued recovery. We still – you know we still have some segments that are struggling, that aren’t anywhere near where they were before, but a lot of the economy is really back and running fairly smoothly and non-pandemic is as well with those segments.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, cool. And then secondly, the gross margin outlook for the High-Touch looks pretty consistent with the outlook in February. But my question is and I think you hit on this, are there cost headwinds that creep in during the second half relative to what you just reported here in the first quarter? I ask, because the first quarter adjusted results, you know near 40% imply that the second half could be 40% or higher, you know because the mix is going to improve. So is there an offset is the question?
D.G. Macpherson: You know not really offset. So we think there's going to be some inflation. It's already starting to come in as Dee mentioned. We think as she said, that price cost is going to be neutral for the year. We think most of that's going to be noise. We think we’re going to get a little better mix moving forward, and then we get through the inventory write downs and you know where we're at now is similar to where we're likely to be moving forward, so it's not going to be a big shift due to cost increases that we foresee at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: Hi! Good morning. Yeah, this all looks very good and thank you for all the modeling details, but I have a strategy question. Could you update us on the High-Touch Strategy, if you want to talk about sales force technology, service offerings, any key initiatives for the rest of this year and into 2022, please D.J. – D.G., sorry.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, sure, sure, absolutely. Thanks Dave. You know so I would say that our strategic initiatives remain similar to what they've been the last year or so. We continue to invest pretty heavily in technology to improve our digital offerings to make this more curated and to help customers [Inaudible]
David Manthey: D.G., I'm not sure if anybody else is having the trouble hearing you. Is the moderator around here?
Operator: Yes, Mr. Macpherson, can you adjust your mic here. You're cutting out quite a bit.
D.G. Macpherson: Okay, can you hear me now?
David Manthey: Much better, yeah.
D.G. Macpherson: Alright, so what I was saying was the initiatives that we have are very similar to what we’ve had the last year. Our merchandising, we continue to invest in merchandising the assortment. We continue to invest in technology to improve our digital solutions. We continue to improve our marketing capabilities and increase spend in the marketing area. And you know our sales initiatives, a lot of what we're doing with our sellers is just getting back in front of customers again. We’ve done a really nice job of staying connected to customers and we're now getting out in the field more and we’re able to visit customers and re-engage and get started on things that might have been put off. And the other thing I'd say is, we've really seen nice growth in our KeepStock technology, and we're going to continue invest in KeepStock and improve our ability to serve customers and maintain their inventory. So those are the main initiatives in the business. All are moving along well and effectively.
David Manthey: Sounds good. Thanks again D.G. I appreciate it.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.
Christopher Glynn: Hey, thanks. The low double digits are again a daily outlook, clearly very good. I'm wondering what amount of lower pandemic product sales is that net out. I was sort of thinking 3% given the 50 basis point delta with the H.T.S. outlook versus the market for the present year versus your normal 3% to 4% outgrowth, but maybe you have a better way to frame it up.
D.G. Macpherson: Sure. Chris, just so I understand the question. Are you asking what we think is going to happen to the pandemic product sales as the year progresses?
Christopher Glynn: Well, basically your top line guidance has some you know headwind netted out from lower pandemic sales. I’m wondering what kind of the mid-point basis that that is.
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, okay. So you know we – as Dee mentioned last year, at the peak of the pandemic we were probably 30% pandemic sales and for the year it was 28%. You know we're running about 25% now. We do expect that to moderate and get closer to 20%. I would say, we expect relative to 2019, we still expect some elevated pandemic sales. We're seeing that with, certainly for any of you that have been in the hospitals or medical offices, you know there's still much more PPE than in the past. We see that in government agencies, we see that in retail establishments and certainly in warehouses. So we expect some elevated, but we expect to slowly see that go from that 25% number down approaching 20%, closer to 20% by the end of the year. So we expect the comparisons year-over-year to go down with the pandemic, as non-pandemic comes up. But we don't expect the elevated sales to go away entirely. We expect there to be some long tail out here where there’s going to be elevated pandemic sales, so that's our expectation.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, great. And just a point of clarification, I missed the revenue comments from the second quarter.
D.G. Macpherson: On the call?
Christopher Glynn: Yeah.
D.G. Macpherson: Dee, do you want to get that?
Dee Merriwether: Yeah. I mean the only thing we mentioned related to Q2 really was what we kind of lay out for High-Touch Solutions on page 9, which is between the range in April of 15 to 16.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.
Nigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Great color in the slides, so thanks for that. I wanted to hone in on 2Q gross margins, and first of all, if we could just clarify the price cost recovery and mutual comments, is that on $1 basis. I’m assuming that’s $1 basis and therefore there’d be some element of margin dilution from there. Could you just clarify that? And then on 2Q margins, gross margins, are we still in a situation where you know normal seasonality, whatever normal means, would have gross margins down Q-to-Q? And then how do we size the inventory impact into 2Q versus 1Q? Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: So Dee, do you want to go ahead and take that one?
Dee Merriwether: Sure. I mean, at the total company level we're expecting GP to be about flat year-over-year. I’d also reference you to you know – we really didn't size Q2. Specifically, we kind of talked about what we believe the size of the impact is this quarter, and that we do not expect an inventory adjustment to be actually any larger than the adjustment that we had in Q1. We are still selling through a lot of the pandemic product very well; however, as we go through the year, we really want to get back to focusing on non-pandemic through investing in inventory and serving our customers well, so you know based upon the sell through on whatever we have remaining, it will be the adjustments that we expect in the second quarter, because we really want to get past that and get back to much normal operating numbers on a go forward basis.
Nigel Coe: And then the price cost impact, but this is margin.
Dee Merriwether: So from a price cost perspective, I will go back probably to the earlier question and response, which is you know we're seeing some inflation in the market. You know we took some pricing actions earlier in the year. We continue to work with our supply base. You know on any increases we have a pretty rigorous cost process that we work with our suppliers based on facts and from an outlook perspective, if we continue to see any more inflation that we feel and deem as needed to be passed on to customers, we feel confident in our ability to do that and that is why from an outlook perspective we are targeting price cost neutrality for the year.
D.G. Macpherson: And Nigel, just to your point, the numbers, the inflation numbers are small enough that it doesn't really have a meaningful impact on Grainger, weather its $1 or rate. So we expect that to be very little impact, either on dollars or rate.
Nigel Coe: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your questions.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. You guys have talked about Zoro margins getting into the high single digit range. But if we think a longer term beyond I think the three to five years you guys have talked about, is there a structural reason that Zorro cannot get to the MonotaRO 12%-ish level. I'm going to ask if Zoro gross margin is running at 500 bips above MonotaRO, which is quite meaningful, and I presume it is supported by the Grainger U.S. distribution network.
D.G. Macpherson: So, there's a lot in that question. So we do expect Zoro margins in the three to five year frame to be back, tipping in the upper single digits. There are some differences in the Japanese market and the U.S. market. The digital advertising market is very, very different and so that’s a structural difference. You know we expect the – one thing I'd point out is over time, and we’ve already started to see this. As we added skews into the assortment, we’ve actually leveraged third party shipper relationships more. We've already seen – you know we're getting away a little bit from the U.S. supply chains. The U.S. supply chains still makes up the bulk of the shipments, but not – will not be in that position forever. And one other thing – reason that's important is, on any way you look at it, the return on invested capital in the business going forward is going to be very strong. Today either we reallocate some of the U.S. inventory very strong, and as it goes forward it'll even be stronger. So we don't expect to get fully to the Japanese margins. It's a different market, different market dynamics, but we do expect to have very strong profitability from the business, both from an operating margin perspective, but even more so from a return on invested capital.
Chris Snyder: I appreciate that. And then turning to the U.S. High-Touch, how do you feel about the revised 300 bps and 400 bps of outgrowth relative to when you first gave the guidance last year? And are you seeing new customers that came last year for pandemic products, re-order non pandemic?
D.G. Macpherson: I’d say the short answer is, we feel good about the 300 to 400 basis points. You know last year if you take all the mess away, from what we saw, which was positive for us in terms of share gains given our supply chain strength and position, we were over 400 basis points of share gains just on sort of our demand generation activities. This year adjusted will be in a similar position. Something like that number we think is a good number for us at this point. What was the second half of that? I'm sorry.
Chris Snyder: Are the new customers that came last year for pandemic products, are you seeing them in the order now panned out?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, absolutely. We're seeing strong repurchase from those customers and you know we – one of the things I would say is that, in the heat of the pandemic we had more consumer volume that we typically would have had. Filtering through that and getting the business customers, we’re seeing strong business repeated and business repeated in non-pandemic product as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone and I’ll also echo the – how much we appreciate the slides. Even though it’s the first time we've seen the new cast, yet it seems pretty intuitive there and a lot of details, so thanks. Here's my question; in these remarks sheet, it said that not all costs will come back and was hoping you could either just size for us, so just you know frame what kinds of costs maybe magnitude. And did I hear correctly that you're assuming only 50 basis points of outgrowth? Is that a second quarter or 2021 assumption?
Dee Merriwether: Sure. You want me to start D.G. here?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, go ahead.
Dee Merriwether: So, as it relates to not all comps will come back, I think – you know I know we've learned a lot during the pandemic about working remotely and internally we're looking at what that could mean for us long term as it relates to helping us improve the SGA leverage on an ongoing basis. You know there may be different ways as you can imagine. We can interact with investors in the more virtual means as an example with suppliers and with customers to some extent in the future, so we may have some impact on a long term basis on overall company travel expenses as an example. Those are the type of things that we're thinking about and looking at now to help us look at long term leverage opportunity. You know so hopefully that helps answer that part of the question. And can you repeat the last part again Deane?
Deane Dray: Yes, it was the assumption of 50 basis points of outgrowth and I think that was for 2021. It seems that's under trend, but if you look at on a two year average maybe you're in line, but what's causing the more modest outgrowth?
Dee Merriwether: Yeah, so you know we continue to share that there was a lot of noise last year in 2020 and you know last quarter and then now we talked about the fact that we believe our 2020 share gain was inflated due to the pandemic and so then this year as we lap that, our share gain will be less than that. It’ll be muted as we lap those one-time, you know non-repeating pretty large orders that we experienced last year. So that's why we put those two year metrics in. We think it's more reasonable, because it takes out some of the noise that’s not perfect and so yes, then this year based upon that, we expect to outgrow the market by 50 bps. But as you said, last year at 800 when you average those two to get to about 425, and that is still above the targeted goal we set of you know consistently growing 300 to 400 basis points above the market.
Deane Dray: Alright, that's really helpful. And then just as a second question, the 30 basis points of structural headwind from the lower margin Endless Assortment growing faster than High-Touch, is that the same kind of headwind we should expect for 2022, like the same magnitude? If not, you know what might change? Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, I would say yeah, we haven't calculated exactly, but I would see no reason why it would be similar. Our expectation is that the Assortment Business will continue to grow at about 20% a year moving forward and we’ll continue to gain share in the U.S. and the High-Touch is at a similar pace, so that should be roughly right. You know the map changed a little bit as the Endless Assortment gets bigger, but they should be roughly right.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jeffries. Please state your question.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning, thank you. My question is on the medium customer growth. It was pretty good in Q1 at 11%. Could you maybe talk about what your market share today is now on the medium customer business and then just remind us how accretive medium customers are to gross margins as well. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: To share on….
Operator: Mr. Macpherson, it sounds like your mic is cutting out again.
D.G. Macpherson: Okay, sorry about that. Is it better now?
Operator: Yeah, go ahead please.
D.G. Macpherson: Alright, there you go. So in terms of mid-sized customer growth, we're seeing very good growth right now. We will continue to see good growth. One of the reasons is that last year during the height of the pandemic we allocated inventory to the hospitals and government agencies. Actually it’s the right thing to do and so we had just inflated the growth of mid-sized customers last year. So we're going to see very good numbers this year and a lot of that's real, but a lot of that's due to the fact that we detailed inventory last year. Our expect – we’re about 2% share with mid-sized customers. We have a lot of room to grow. We’re getting back to where we were several years ago when we think we've got – you know 10 years ago, but we think we've got a long ways to go to grow and both with uncovered customers through digital means and through covered customers and inside sales we’re saying nice growth rates. And in terms of margin, its significantly higher gross profit. You know on the contribution margin level it's not as big a difference, but still a difference and you know we talked about 500 basis point plus difference in the past.
Hamzah Mazari: Got you. And just my follow-up question is just on the Endless Assortment Business. Could you maybe talk about MonotaRO growing sales with enterprise customers? Is that something that's new? Is that something that Zoro can do as well or is that just sort of a difference in the market place in Japan versus the U.S.?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, it's a great question, it’s not new. MonotaRO been doing it for five or six years I think. I may have that a little bit wrong, but something like that, they become better at it. The market in Japan is very, very different. I would say that there aren’t distributors like Grainger serving customers with the kind of intensity that we have in the U.S. there, enterprise customers, and so we’re going to keep Zoro focused on small and mid-sized businesses. There's a ton of runway for small and mid-sized businesses. And as they get better, we're seeing the fruits of that work and so that's going to be our focus for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jake Levinson with Melius Research. Please state your question.
Jake Levinson: Good morning everyone.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Jake Levinson: Just turning to Canada for a second, I just wanted to ask if you – you guys see a path to profitability in that business that looks more like what we see in the U.S. over time?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, the answers is yes, we do. Obviously, we’ve had a long ride that’s been challenged in Canada. I think for the last two year, for the first time we have a really good customer experience. We have a team that's really energized. We will be – we feel we will be right at breakeven this year, we will be profitable next year and that's with what has been a very difficult path economically for Canada. So, we feel good, you know whether or not we're going to get it up to the level of the U.S., ours is debatable. We feel like we have line of sight to getting it to strong profitability in Canada, and there's really no structural reason why we can't do that, and we are just on the execution path to making that happen now.
Jake Levinson: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you D.G. I’ll pass it on.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Marek with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.
Kevin Marek: Yes, hi! Thanks, good morning.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Kevin Marek: Just with respect to the full year guidance, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the general supply chain conditions we touched on. It’s obviously, a topic that you talked about a lot and I’m curious if you’re seeing, and what kind of improvement or lack thereof you're expecting within the full year guide?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, so I assume you're referring to sort of a lot of the global challenges in the supply chain. We see some of those issues certainly, the freight markets challenging right now. It's actually easing a bit and getting a little bit better as we head throughout the year it appears, and we feel like servicing costs are going to be – we have a decent chance for where that’s going to go. You know we see some of our customers disrupted by supply chain challenges, certainly you know automotive has been one that there’s been a lot of press on. Most of our customers are not disrupted by some of the supply chain challenges that we see, so we don't expect huge disruptions, although we expect a lot of messiness in the supply chain. I would say some things are getting a little bit better. I think port clearance is getting a little bit better now which is good to see. We are trying to bring a bunch of inventory into our buildings as we grow and there’s challenges. I would say in the entire supply chain, certain things are slower than they've been historically and I think that's definitely a condition that everybody has. Our assumption is that there's going to be messiness, we’ll manager it as well or better than anybody else and come through it well. At this point, but we do recognize that there's a lot of challenges in supply chain right now.
Kevin Marek: Got it, thank you. And just a follow-up, just looking at the other segment, you’ve narrowed the loss to $3 million in 1Q. Just curious what you're seeing there? I think you said having losses in ’21 turning to profitability in the second half. You know they are medium term, kind of profitability target or framework that you should be thinking about?
D.G. Macpherson: You know I think most of that, most of the Cromwell business and I would say a couple things about the Cromwell business. One is, that business has very high customer satisfaction now. It has very high team engagement, they were just named 11th I guess best employer in the U.K. for large companies. That is very different than where we were at three years ago, on both of those dimensions and you know they're starting to see a return to growth now. U.K. is doing okay coming out the pandemic. We have some confidence that they're going to actually be able to get back to growth and get back to profitability, taking a bunch of cost out of the business and they're doing a lot of the right things. So, we feel good about it. It's too early for me to talk about where they’re going to be kind of mid-term. We’ve talked about, we need to see profitability from that business next year. We expect to exit the year profitable in Cromwell and that's going to be kind of a big check point for us, but there's a lot of positive signs that we will be able to do that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please state your question.
Adam Uhlman: Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on good execution this quarter. I have a couple of questions on Zoro. First of all, I think you mentioned there has been some changes with the discounting strategies at Zoro. I guess what's changed there to help drive the gross margin expansion.
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, I won’t go into too many details Adam. Thanks for the question. I would just say that we’ve used some analytics to determine where discount works and where it doesn't work. And that has allowed us to be more targeted in our discounting to acquire new customers, and that is a big part of what the benefit and improvements are.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. And then related to the customer count, thanks for sharing all that details, it's really helpful. I guess I'm surprised that Zoro and MonotaRO have the same number of customers, but MonotaRO is twice the size in revenues as Zoro is. As we think about like you know the path forward closing that gap, is all that just the skew expansion that you mentioned to get better customer penetration within the Zoro customers or is there other levers that you need to pull to continue to drive that sales growth.
D.G. Macpherson: I think its two things Adam. I think it’s skew expansion and I think it’s, to your point about the size of the customer from the revenue. It's repeat buying and the Zoro business is getting traction on doing better, getting repeat volume from customers and building relationships with existing customers more, and that's been a lesson that we're learning from the Japanese business, that they've done very, very well. Is how do you take – how do you take a customer who buys and actually turn them into a customer for a long time. And that's the other piece that the team is really working hard to drive, and those are the skew count and that are really the drivers of what we need to get.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.
Michael McGinn: Hey, thanks a lot for sneaking me in here. I just wanted to go back to the Endless Assortment model. Can you talk about the trajectory of GMV versus the sales and maybe the skew count? And as you shift away from the U.S. supply chain, I think you alluded to, does that change your private label mix within your overall business?
D.G. Macpherson: You know I’ll ask you to repeat the first part of that. Our private label mix should change all that much. Most of the private level we sell is through the Grainger brand and we are going to continue to push on growing private brand. And we have great brands and great products, and working hard to make sure we're able to cross those with national brands and that type of thing. I didn't quite understand the first part of your question. Could you repeat that?
Michael McGinn: Yeah, so sequentially active skews on Zoro went from 6.1 to 6.7. I'm trying to kind of back into what is the internal I guess sales contribution versus what's being done on a GMV basis that would be more indicative of that reseller model that you're shifting to? So the skews went up 9% sequentially, does that – is the GMV sales trend following that same kind of trajectory?
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, so what I would say there is a couple of things. One is, most of the new skews we’re adding are going to be third party. We already have access to Zoro through Grainger, Grainger skews. So most of them are going to be third party, not all of those. The other thing I would say is that if you look at - we look very carefully at sort of revenue per skew for different tranches of ads. We continue to see very high productivity and similar revenue per skew as we add items across the assortment at Zoro, and in fact, given the numbers of skews we’ve added over the last couple of years, if you look at those curves, you will get pretty confident that we're going to see a big lift over time as we continue to add skews given what we are seeing. So we're pretty confident about sort of revenue path and what skew expansion will add for that business.
Michael McGinn: Okay. And then, I don't know if this is asked or it was in the script, but the variance in national versus smaller and mid-sized accounts, is that simply a function. I think you've turned off some skews last year to protect some of the large customers. So it’s an easy comp or some other distributors or large customers are coming back faster than the local accounts. So any color there would be great.
D.G. Macpherson: Yeah, I mean we are seeing good activity with both large and local accounts. I would say that for us you're going to see, particularly in the second quarter you're going to see a bigger list with mid-sized and local accounts as a result of holding skews in inventory for hospitals and government agencies in the peak of the pandemic last year. So we turned off skews for a number of our customers to make sure that we can get the product to the most helpful place, and so that's going to be a big factor in what you see.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with G Research. Please state your question.
Justin Bergner: Thank you for double sneaking me in D.G. and Dee. My first question is, with respect to mix, as we look at the business over the medium term, obviously mid-sized customers are growing a little bit faster. Maybe there's some headwinds from larger customers getting larger. Is mix sort of a neutral for your U.S. business as you look at the business on a two to three year view?
D.G. Macpherson: So, we haven't shared probably the full perspective. I think mix is likely to be, if at all slightly positive in the High-Touch business. It's slightly negative from the growth of the Endless Assortment. As a company level we would expect it to not be a huge lever either way, but we do we do feel like the mid-sized customers are likely to grow faster over the next several years. So, I think that will be a slight positive.
Justin Bergner: Okay, and then the other question I’ll slip in was the government sales looked very strong this quarter and they were lapping a pretty good comp. I mean I realize there's a lot of comp noise there, but is there anything you want to call out that was particularly positive in the government performance this quarter that maybe was beyond the pandemic.
D.G. Macpherson: No, I mean I think our government team does a great job and we have great relationships with government customers. Their comp gets tougher you know in the second quarter for sure, and the third quarter given the pandemic activities. I would say, you know the initial flow last year at the pandemic hospitals were far and away the biggest demand and then government came in after that, but overall we are seeing really nice run rates with our government customers and expect that to continue.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back over to Mr. D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Alright, terrific. Thanks for joining us. I really appreciate having you on the call. You know I would just reiterate that with what we've seen as we look through the last 18 months is certainly remarkable for all of us, but if you sort of boil it down, I think what we are likely to see is for us significant share gain over a two year period and I think our economics will be in a better place when we come out of this than when we started going into the pandemic at the end of 2019. We feel like we’ve got great customer relationships and our team has done a very nice job of providing good service through what has been a challenging time and we feel like we are really in a good place going forward. So, with that I’ll close, and I wish you all a fantastic day. Thanks for your time. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Deidra Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO.  As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q4 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm excited that our new CFO, Dee Merriwether is here with me. Dee brings a wealth of financial and operational expertise and a deep understanding of Grainger's business that will serve us well. She has been with Grainger for 8 years in finance, pricing and sales leadership roles. It's great to have her as our new CFO. For the call today, I'd like to provide an overview of 2020, highlighting accomplishments and challenges. Clearly, much of the year has been shaped by the pandemic, but I'll also highlight our progress on key strategic initiatives. Then I'll turn it over to Dee to review the details of our fourth quarter results. I'll close by discussing how we will resegment the business to more closely reflect how we think about the company, and we'll also touch on our high level opportunities and priorities for both the high-touch and endless assortment businesses.  2020 was obviously one of the most challenging and intense years in history. Through it all, we demonstrated agility, resilience and a steadfast focus on supporting our customers and team members. At the start of the pandemic, we laid out 3 basic priorities: to serve our customers well, support our team members and ensure we remain strong financially. I can confidently say we've been able to accomplish all 3, and I'm proud of how the team has continued to execute on our purpose to keep the world working by living our principles every day.  Over the last year, we persevered through the pandemic while continuing to deliver an exceptional customer experience. We've deepened relationships with existing customers and developed new relationships, many of which have returned from multiple purchases. We helped our customers secure product, manage their inventory and solve their problems as we further embed KeepStock and our other solutions in their facilities. Grainger was sometimes the only vendor our customers allowed on their sites to support their operations; a testament to our deep customer relationships.  Another priority was to support our team members. We operated with the perspective that the pandemic would be challenging and longer in duration than we wanted, but that it would eventually end. As such, we maintained a stable workforce, deployed personnel to safely and effectively serve customers and supported team members to ensure their safety and well-being. The pandemic is, first and foremost, a humanitarian crisis, and supporting our team members has remained a huge priority. Finally, we have remained very strong financially, generating over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow in this difficult year. As it became clear that our business model will be resilient throughout the pandemic, we reverted from a temporary focus on cash preservation to our longer-term strategic priority of growing the business profitably.  The Grainger team has been active in serving our communities through this time of need. We have great team members who value giving back to others. As a company, we provided monetary and product donations to organizations like the Red Cross and the Children's First Fund to support the pandemic response.  Key leadership challenge this year was balancing our pandemic response while continuing to build the company for the future. Throughout, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives.  Within our high-touch solutions model, we improve the way customers find the products they need. We know this is core to our growth. In 2020, we launched our product information management system, which provides the foundation for our merchandising efforts. We now have over $2.8 billion of our product assortment remerchandised, $1.6 billion completed in 2020 alone. We also made enhancements to our search functionality and mobile app, resulting in a better user experience. We added features like search by image, where you can take a picture of the product you're looking for and get accurate matches to relevant items quickly and easily.  We took a significant step forward with our marketing capabilities in 2020. We brought more capabilities in-house to develop the competitive advantage of industry-specific knowledge. These efforts helped us gain share and increase customer acquisition with the Grainger brand. We developed new capabilities to support on-site inventory management, including vending solutions and technology, allowing us to remotely upgrade or alter installations to better serve customers during the pandemic.  We also opened a new distribution center in Louisville earlier this year, now our largest facility, with the capacity to stock 700,000 products in a strategic geographic location. We leveraged the building to test product expansion on a set of new categories with very strong results.  We also made strong progress with our endless assortment businesses. Zoro continued to expand its product portfolio, adding 2.5 million items in 2020 to bring the total SKUs to over 6 million. Zoro also improved its marketing capabilities, resulting in improved ROI and higher customer repeat rates. They are leveraging the MonotaRO playbook to improve the fundamental growth and profitability of the business. MonotaRO continued its exceptional growth and profitability performance. All in all, a great year for the endless assortment team.  Now before I review our 2020 results, I think it's helpful to step back and take a look at the impact the pandemic has had on our operating performance. From a revenue perspective, we started to see a shift to pandemic-related products starting in mid-February of last year. In late March, as pandemic product demand surged, we saw a significant decline in other non-pandemic product as lockdowns took hold. Since that point, we have seen continued strong sales of pandemic products, which has ebbed and flowed based on the virus, including another surge in the fourth quarter, which mirrored the increase in case counts.  Non-pandemic products are slowly coming back, and while not yet at pre-pandemic levels, they have improved quite a bit from April lows. We expect the pandemic to continue to impact revenue through at least the first half of 2021 and then start to moderate as vaccinations take hold. Steve will detail our forward-looking thoughts in a bit.  The pandemic has also had a big impact on gross profit, driven by 2 main factors: First, we were impacted by product and customer mix. Pandemic products are generally lower-margin, and we sold large quantities to health care and government customers, which typically receive more favorable pricing. This was exasperated early on as we initially prioritized product allocation to those most in need like health systems and those in the front lines. So sell-through margins have been negatively affected by these mix impacts.  The second driver is that we have been aggressive in supporting our customers by trying to anticipate the needs they might have. As a result, we placed large orders for certain products in Q2 of last year. As we have gone through the pandemic surges, the supply-demand picture has changed rapidly for some products and we had to revalue our inventory to reflect this reality. The vast majority of our purchases have worked well, a few have not. We have reverted to our normal purchasing processes, and we'll continue to monitor market dynamics as the situation unfolds.  The impact on GP is easier to understand sequentially. Our GP dropped significantly in Q2 and has been impacted the remainder of the year. Moving forward, we expect U.S. GP to improve sequentially and to exit 2021 as high or higher than we started in Q1 2020. Finally, as we look at SG&A, overall net costs were lower despite some increased costs for enhanced safety including protocols and workforce disruptions. The team was able to tightly control costs while also continuing to invest for the long term. Despite these unique and challenging circumstances, we were still able to deliver strong overall performance in 2020. A few of the highlights: We delivered organic constant currency daily sales growth of 3.5% at the total company level, driven by our above-market growth of 800 basis points in the U.S. due in part to pandemic-related sales. Also, we achieved over 18% daily sales growth in the endless assortment businesses. We delivered operating margin of 11.2%, reflecting strong SG&A leverage, which helped to offset the previously mentioned pandemic fuel GP headwinds. We generated over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow while returning $939 million to shareholders to dividends and buybacks. And we remain disciplined in our capital deployment, maintaining strong adjusted ROIC of over 28% for the company. In order to focus on our core high-touch and endless assortment businesses, we divested Fabory and China, 2 non-core businesses abroad.  Overall, I am confident in the direction we are heading and very excited about the future. We have gained significant share and strong capabilities. We are in a very good position to deliver strong performance this year and for years to come as the pandemic loses its grip. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through the fourth quarter results. Dee?
Deidra Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. Turning to our quarterly performance. Organic daily sales, which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory and China, finished up 5.6% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. Underpinned by growth in our U.S. segment and continued impressive performance in our endless assortment businesses.  In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader MRO market which contracted about 1.5% to 2% versus prior year. Our gains were driven by pandemic-related demand, which remains at elevated levels, sales to new customers and growth with midsized customers. The endless assortment model continues to deliver with 20% growth in daily sales again in the fourth quarter, while also generating improved operating margins. We remain very excited about the future of this business, and we'll discuss our plans to provide further transparency as we introduce our new GAAP reportable segments for 2021.  At the total company level, margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds, primarily in the U.S. segment. I will detail the pandemic mix more in a few slides. In addition, we continue to see business unit mix impact as we experienced significant growth from our endless assortment businesses.  SG&A costs were favorable by $42 million year-over-year as we captured 235 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period through prudent cost controls in the U.S. and Canada, and we gained strong expense leverage in our endless assortment businesses. This resulted in Q4 operating margin at 10%, down 75 basis points from the fourth quarter last year.  From a cash flow perspective, the business continues to produce robust cash flow, with operating cash flow of $336 million at 170% of net adjusted earnings, and free cash flow of $291 million. We restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and completed $500 million of repurchases in the period. Finally, we delivered strong return on invested capital at over 28% for the full year.  Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.7% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products remains elevated, up 49% in the quarter, but have tapered off in the peak in the second quarter. We continue to see meaningful improvement in our non-pandemic products trends, which has improved to down 7% in the quarter, exiting the year with December at lowest decline, down 5%.  We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions month-over-month with encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we see improved growth with both large and midsized customers, with the latter growing about 6% in the quarter, continuing to show signs of improvement from earlier in the year. Gross margin of 35.7% was down 290 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven most notably by pandemic-related headwinds, which accounted for nearly 90% of the GP decline. The pandemic impact was driven by continued product and customer mix and mark-to-market inventory adjustments, which D.G. outlined earlier, as well as freight-related surcharges, net of pass-through shipping charges to customers.  In the second half of 2020, we started getting solid traction on price realization, which nearly offset continued cost headwinds as we exited the year. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 155 basis points of leverage with cost decreasing approximately $14 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower depreciation and general operating efficiencies.  Operating margin declined to 12.8% in the fourth quarter as the pandemic impact of gross margin weighted more heavily than the SG&A leverage gained. Adjusted return on invested capital was a very healthy 36.5% for the full year of 2020.  Now looking at pandemic product trends. While sales of pandemic-related products decreased from the second quarter through October, continued demand for key products, including masks, gloves and cleaning supply has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year, and we saw this pick up again in the last few months of the year as cases spiked headed into the winter.  We've also seen customers across industries prepare for the vaccine distribution maybe related but slightly different products like those required to work in refrigerated storage units. January sales remain elevated and have tapered off from Q4.  On the non-pandemic side, things continue to get better. We exited the year with December down 5% and have continued to see improvement with January, roughly flat year-over-year. Looking at share gain on Slide 10. We estimate the U.S. MRO market decline between 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter, showing strong improvement from the mid-teens decline we saw in the second quarter. Grainger was able to capture roughly 550 basis points of outgrowth, fueled by pandemic-related sales and our growth initiatives.  On a full-year basis, we estimate that we have outgrown the broader MRO market by roughly 800 basis points. This outgrowth was aided by significant pandemic-related volume, some of which, particularly in the second and third quarters, was related to large onetime orders that are unlikely to reoccur. We estimate that approximately 250 basis points of the market growth in 2020 was a result of these non-repeating pandemic transactions.  Accordingly, as we move into 2021 and lap these pandemic sales spikes, we expect to see some volatility in our year-over-year share gain metric. That being said, we are confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during these challenging times. We believe we are doing the right things in merchandising, marketing and sales effectiveness to drive repeat purchases and produce 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. high-touch business.  Moving to our other businesses. Organic daily sales increased 14.6% or 13% on a constant currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at an approximately 20%, with strong results in both MonotaRO and Zoro during the quarter. For our international high-touch business in both Mexico and Cromwell, we saw continued sequential improvement. However, both businesses remain impacted by pandemic-related shutdown.  Overall, operating margins for other businesses were up 210 basis points. The favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage and endless assortment, notably at Zoro, which lapped heavy investment spend in the prior year period. Zoro continues to execute the MonotaRO playbook and deliver low single-digit results for the year.  Turning to Slide 12. The Canadian market has seen an overall economic slowdown during the pandemic, which has notably impacted our natural resource and export customers. Throughout the pandemic, our team in Canada has remained focused on serving new and existing customers well while also accelerating our customer diversification efforts.  In Canada, daily sales decreased 3.2%, or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Volumes in Canada reflect the pandemic-driven slowdown. However, the business continued to improve sequentially. We have positive sales growth in the month of December, and we believe the business is well suited for post-pandemic growth. Gross margin at Grainger Canada declined 1,040 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by lapping significant onetime supply chain efficiencies, and to a lesser extent, the impact of pandemic-related headwinds. Cost management and the benefit of pandemic-related subsidies resulted in 315 basis points of SG&A leverage.  Given the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the subsequent path of economic recovery, we will not be providing formal guidance at this time. This picture remains fluid, as does the shape of the pandemic and the customer demand for pandemic products. Similar to the last few quarters, we want to continue providing some insights into how we're thinking about the current quarter's performance. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for January show year-over-year sales of about 9% at the total company level on a daily organic constant currency basis. While this is a strong start to the quarter, we faced more difficult comps in February and March when pandemic sales started to spike. With this, we expect daily sales to moderate and end the first quarter up between 3% and 5% organically. Note, we'll also have 1 less selling day this quarter.  From a gross margin perspective, we expect GP improvement of around 50 to 100 basis points sequentially versus Q4 2020. This anticipated lift is underpinned by a slowdown in pandemic product demand, continued price cost recovery and the lapping of freight headwinds experienced in Q4 2020.  On a year-over-year basis, this would imply GP will be down between 150 to 200 basis points in the quarter.  With respect to SG&A, we expect costs will inch up sequentially as business activity progresses and if things like variable comp reset with the start of the new year. With this, we anticipate SG&A of between $730 million to $750 million for the first quarter of 2021. While this is up slightly versus Q4 2020, we will still be down meaningfully year-over-year. As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in the business for the long term.  From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to our balanced framework. For 2021, we anticipate investing between $225 million and $275 million back into the business. These CapEx investments include DC expansion in Japan, continued IT and KeepStock investments in the U.S., and normal levels of maintenance capital. Beyond that, we anticipate executing a similar dividend and share repurchase strategy, putting between $600 million to $700 million to work on repurchases in 2021.  Although we are not providing 2021 guidance, I thought it might be helpful to provide some insights as to how a post-pandemic recovery could play out through the year. As it's the largest portion of our business and one of the most impacted by the pandemic, we have charted our U.S. segment on Slide 14 and 15, to give you some context. As we have seen continued progress on vaccine distribution and a return to near full economic activity as we enter into the second half of 2021, we would expect our results to trend back towards more normalized levels.  On Slide 14, we map out year-over-year sales growth in dollars. Similar to our pandemic/non-pandemic sales chart, you can see the quarter-to-quarter sales spikes from pandemic-related products, most pronounced in the second quarter, which remained elevated through the year, and finished up $835 million or 54% in 2020. This drove pandemic product mix as a percent of total sales to 28%, a large increase compared to 19% in 2019. Conversely, non-pandemic sales were down dramatically in the second quarter and remains depressed through the balance of the year, finishing down $540 million or 8% in 2020. These trends did improve sequentially.  In 2021, we expect to face lapping headwinds as pandemic sales continue to moderate from the spikes we saw last year. That being said, I think it's important to remember that more than 70% of our sales comes from non-pandemic products, and as the economy recovers and these sales rebound, it should more than offset the lapping headwinds from pandemic-related products. This will also help to normalize our product mix back towards pre-COVID levels. Accordingly, we would expect to see year-over-year growth in 2021, but the magnitude will be determined by the pace of the economic recovery.  Related to gross profit margin, as product mix trends towards pre-pandemic levels, we would expect to see improved GP rates throughout the year. This includes sequential improvement from Q4 2020, beginning in Q1 2021. We expect to exit the year with U.S. GP rates as high or higher than Q1 2020 levels.  I want to reiterate, while this commentary relates to the U.S. business, we showcased it because it represents more than 70% of the total company results and was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic.  With that, I will turn it back over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Turning to Slide 17. I am excited to announce changes to our GAAP reporting structure, which will better align our financial disclosure to the way we manage the company, while also providing increased transparency for the investment community. Beginning in 2021, we will shift our segments to high-touch North America and endless assortment. Thinking about these businesses under two new segments is consistent with our strategic priorities for each segment and how our teams are organized internally.  Our new high-touch North America segment is comprised of our Grainger-branded businesses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. This further solidifies the work we have done over the last couple of years to create a consistent go-to-market approach across the region while also merging the commercial functions of these businesses into a single organization. It also reflects the fact that we run the supply chain as 1 entity across the region. We feel confident that these businesses are well situated to support our customers with quicker more coordinated decisions to drive profitable share gain and exceptional customer solutions across North America. Given the growing size and importance of our endless assortment model, the timing is right to begin providing stand-alone disclosures for this important business.  Our endless assortment segment will consist of our MonotaRO and Zoro businesses, which operate primarily in Japan, Korea, the U.S. and the U.K. We continue to more closely align the operations of these businesses, taking a lead from the success we've had at MonotaRO. Alongside these changes, we will also take the opportunity to simplify our corporate cost allocation and intercompany sales methodologies to better align with industry best practices.  Given the amount of change, we wanted to preview the resegmentation this morning in preparation of shifting to the new structure, starting with our first quarter 2021 results. Between now and our Q1 earnings call, the team will be working to file our 2020 10-K in normal course under our historical presentation. And then shortly thereafter, we expect to file an 8-K with 3-year recast and summary financials reflecting the new segmentation. Including quarterly information for the 2020 period.  On March 9, we then plan to host a modeling call to help you fully understand the change and to answer any additional questions that you may have. This should position us well for our Q1 call on April 30, which I would point out is a week later or so than normal. Going forward, given our new endless assortment reportable segment, we will be pushing back our earnings call calendar to align with MonotaRO's schedule.  Shifting gears, we continue to execute against our business priorities. In our high-touch solutions model, we remain focused on remerchandising our product line to ensure customers and team members can find the right solutions quickly. We know that remerchandise categories see increased sell-through rates while also significantly improving the user experience, so this work is an important pillar in our share gain efforts. We expect to remerchandise an additional $1.5 billion of product in 2021. This process has become embedded in the way we work and will be a constant moving forward.  We will continue to invest in and improve our marketing efforts, which supports all customers and has delivered proven share gain over the past few years. We'll continue to deepen customer relationship with KeepStock and further strengthen our KeepStock offer to create more value for customers and ensure we have a competitive advantage. We will continue to improve our offer and sales strategy with both large, multisite customers, as well as midsized customers. And lastly, we will continue to improve the path that we are on with our Canada operations as part of the North America Grainger business unit. Our improved cost position, exceptional service, and early success in expanding into new customer segments gives us confidence that we are on the right path in Canada. We will update you on Canada's performance as part of the high-touch North America segment.  In our endless assortment model, we expect to add over 2 million items to Zoro in the U.S. in 2021, pushing us to over 8 million SKUs on the site. We will work to continue improving profitability through enhanced marketing efforts, we will further leverage analytics to refine our customer acquisition funnel and to improve customer repeat rates at Zoro. MonotaRO flexed its resilience in 2020, and we'll look to continue momentum in 2021. The business expects to launch new product and order management systems in the first half of the year to further improve internal processing and shorten lead times. Additionally, work continues on 2 new fulfillment centers, with the Ibaraki facility expected to be completed in mid-2021. There's a lot of great work being done across the organization, and I am excited about the opportunities in front of us in 2021 and beyond.  On Slide '19, I just wanted to reiterate our earnings growth algorithm. As we have shed non-core businesses over the last few years and moved forward with more streamlined reportable segments, the path to long-term growth comes into clearer focus. On the operational side, we feel we are well situated to gain share profitably in our North America high-touch business. This includes 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable annual outgrowth in the U.S., improving top line performance in Canada and operating margin expansion as GP rates recover, and we continue to gain SG&A leverage. In the endless assortment, we expect to continue to produce 20% annual top line growth, while also ramping margins at Zoro U.S. into the mid -- into the high single digits over the next 3 to 5 years. These strong growth drivers, alongside a business that generates consistent free cash flow and has significant capital allocation flexibility, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.  I'm proud of our results for the quarter and the full year and want to thank our team members for their commitment to safety and customer service. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who have been great partners throughout this challenging time. We have needed to work together more than ever over the past year, and those relationships have been crucial. We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing capabilities, deepened our customer relationships, and expanded our assortment while improving margins at Zoro. We are in a strong financial position to grow the business profitably moving forward. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as continuing to execute our strategy, so we can achieve this purpose for years to come.  And with that, we will open the lineup for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.
Ryan Merkel: So first off, can you explain Slide 14 in the deck a little bit more? How much are you assuming pandemic sales to be down in '21? And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what the safety surge headwind could be for 2021?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, sure. So the headwind will largely depend on how long the pandemic goes. If you think about sort of 10 months of -- over 10 months of pandemic sales, we sold about $100 million incremental pandemic product. We feel like -- well, we know that the pandemic sales are very strong right now and will continue to be so. In the year, we would expect several hundred million, something like that, to be a headwind. We also expect to more than recover that in non-pandemic.  And Ryan, I would also comment that given the relationships we have with government and health care customers and the way pandemic sales were throughout the year, our incremental margins on pandemic sales were a lot lower than what we lost. On the smaller loss of revenue for non-pandemic. So we do expect profitability to improve, and we expect to have growth as non-pandemic recovers.
Ryan Merkel: Okay. That's helpful. And then the next slide, the gross margin framework, is really helpful. I guess my question is on 250 basis points of ramp from 4Q '20, do you expect it to be gradual like you're showing? Because I would think in 2Q, you could see a bigger jump based on the comps. And then as part of the answer, can you just tell us how to think about freight and inventory adjustments? Because I would think those impacts would be falling off?
Donald Macpherson: So we expect the freight impacts to fall off in the first quarter in some way and certainly the second quarter as well. Although the freight environment remains tight. I mean, the reality is that more people are shipping product to their homes than ever, as you're probably aware of, and that has driven a fairly tight freight market, but we don't expect to be impacted all that much by that.  In terms of inventory adjustments, just to be clear, in the second quarter of 2020, we took a number of actions to try to get product for our customers to protect service. Many of those worked out; some did not work out as we expected. And we received that product in mostly Q3, I'd say. And so every week that goes by, we learn more. We expect it to match anything we take in inventory to the actual pandemic sales as we learn more, so we would expect that to be -- there's still to be some of those inventory adjustments in the first half of the year, but too slowly -- to fall off after that, basically. So yes, the ramp we show is more like what we'd expect to see, Ryan.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: So in the fourth quarter, you reported 70 basis points of sequential degradation in gross margin. I think your outlook was more for a flat outcome. Can you quantify approximately the material factors that affected the fourth quarter gross margin working from the third quarter levels?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, sure. I'll turn it over to Dee. Roughly, the surge in pandemic had a modest impact. The inventory adjustments had a bigger impact, and was a large part of that. So Dee, do you want to provide a little bit of color?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. Thanks, D.G. So yes, I would say, if you look at the U.S. segment, which I think if you're talking about Slide 15, that over 90% of the impact, the sequential impact from Q3 to Q4 was all pandemic-related headwinds. And D.G talked about -- and I spoke a little bit about our mark-to-market adjustments. I would say, if you look at the full year -- I know you asked a sequential question, but if you look at the full year for the U.S., I will say about half of our full pandemic impact was related to our inventory adjustments.
David Manthey: With a bigger portion in the fourth quarter?
Deidra Merriwether: Correct.
David Manthey: Okay. And then second, as the fourth quarter gross margin didn't play out exactly as you expected relative to your outlook last quarter, when you look at the gross margin outlook here, what factors could prevent you from achieving the anticipated levels that you have outlined here for 2021?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I mean, I think that most of what we have is pretty well understood and known at this point. So if we get to a point where the vaccinations work and the third quarter starts to look better economically and there's less pandemic product, that's generally the shape of how it will play out. Obviously, if the pandemic doesn't get better and we're still in a really elevated pandemic state, and pandemic is still a huge portion of our business, it would be somewhat less. It'd still improve over the year, but they'll be somewhat less as we exit the year than is shown in that slide.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Welcome, Dee. Congrats on the new role.
Deidra Merriwether: Thank you.
Christopher Glynn: I was curious, Dee, you kind of left off with the -- affirming the 3% to 4% outgrowth as your long-term algorithm. For '21, is it reasonable to net the kind of 2.5% of, call it, large pandemic orders against that as a thought as we kind of model out the year?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. In the U.S., I think the way to think about it is we gained 800 basis points of share in 2020. 250 of that, we think, is non-repeating. So you'd say 550 is what we think is real share gain. If we gained 400 basis points of real share gain ex those orders, you'd subtract 250 from that, and we'd be at 150 in the year, and across the 2 years, we'd be 950.  I think the two year story, I think the main point here is that, and I hear it from customers every time I talk to them, and I talk to customers every week at a minimum, we are viewed very favorably in terms of how we've handled this. And certainly, we took extra risk with inventory, and it certainly had an impact on our GP. But we are in a great position from a relationship perspective. And we will have a very strong two year share gain period, and we will exit those 2 years with very strong economics. And so for us, that's really the main point. And that's what we've always been trying to do. And so yes, you do have to subtract the 250. But in any case, it's going to be a very strong share gain over those 2 years.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. That makes sense. And then on the -- again, to kind of affirming exit pitch there. The high single-digit margin at Zoro, if you said it, I missed it. But where was that in 2020? And directionally, does Zoro scale profitability a bit in '21?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, we expect it to go. It was low single digits, so we expect closer to mid-single digits in2021 and high single digits in 3 to 4 years -- 3 to 5 years. That time range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Add my congrats to Dee in her new role.
Deidra Merriwether: Thank you.
Deane Dray: D.G., I don't mean to put you on the spot, but just the -- I'd be interested in hearing maybe just a description of the product category, of what product purchase did not work out or categories that did not work out. Those were just, to replay, that was really a scary time, and I know you were scrambling to get PPE. So I'm kind of anticipating that's going to be an example. But just what didn't go right there just from like a history lesson?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean -- so I mean, a lot did go right? But there are certain categories where supply-demand has changed dramatically since that point, when if you wanted to buy product for your customers, you had to pay -- you had to buy in very large quantities at inflated cost. I would say there's a very narrow range of SKUs that fall into that category. They're all PPE, Deane, that fall into that category that have become the reason for the inventory restatement. It's not like it's hundreds of SKUs. It's a very narrow set of SKUs. And if you ask me, would I do it again? I'd say, yes. I think it was the right decision. A lot of those products are sold to customers and kept them safe. But certainly, you're seeing the impact in terms of the inventory adjustments at this point.
Deane Dray: Good. I fully appreciate that. And that was the answer I was expecting. That was PPE-related. So -- and then second question is maybe we're getting a little better feel for post-pandemic and how the sales will ramp back up. And what I'm trying to do is get a sense of how will the recovery have a different look and feel versus previous recoveries from recessions where you typically get this big restock phenomenon, where customers had run down their own inventory. And now, as they restart, there's a big burst of restocking that goes on. It just doesn't feel that's the way it is going to happen this time. But any color, just to give us a sense of what you're expecting that ramp looks like?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I think it's not going to happen that way, primarily because it's not a broad-based sort of all segment impact. So I think what you're going to see is certain segments turn on. We've already seen manufacturing come back relatively strongly as the year progressed and into 2021. So we've certainly seen some restock. We don't get a lot of restock given what we sell, but we certainly have seen volumes pick up with manufacturing. We still are in a very challenged state with hospitality, airlines, cruise lines, those types of things. And so I think what's going to happen is certain segments seem to turn on as we recover here and they don't all turn up once. So you probably don't see a huge sort of restock, you see more of a phased restock as we go. That would be my expectation. Although if you ask the next person, they may have a different answer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research.
Christopher Dankert: And congratulations again, Dee. I guess, D.G., I know we've gone over this territory before. But I guess with the resegmentation happening now, just again, can we come back to Canada? It's been about 5 years since it's really been a positive contributor here. What's the logic in keeping it around? What's the long-term prospect for getting the thing back to a real contributor to growth and profitability for Grainger here?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, I think it's a great question. So first of all, let me be clear, we expect to provide as much transparency into Canada as we did before the resegmentation. It's quite easy to provide you with the numbers you need to understand what's going on in Canada.  Secondly, though, I would say the performance in Canada last year was pretty good. We've seen growth now in December, and January was good for Canada, which is the first time we've seen that in 4 or 5 years. We have very good customer feedback when I talk to customers there. The feedback is very, very good. Our cost structure is in the right place. We have stabilization in gross profit ex some of the inventory efficiency issues we talked about this quarter, which are not operational. So we feel like the business was roughly breakeven last year in the midst of a pandemic. We actually think it's on a very good path. And we think in the next several years, it's going to be profitable, growing part of the portfolio. We've taken all the hard action now, and we are grinding out customers, and we aren't losing contracts anymore. I mean, it just feels very, very different. And I think we've also built some deep customer relationships through the pandemic. So it's going to be a profitable part of the North America portfolio, albeit not as big as it once was, but it will start growing now, is our expectation.
Christopher Dankert: Got it. Got it. And then again, just thinking about price mix in the U.S. specifically, pretty nice results in the fourth quarter. I know we're not guiding, but just how do you think about pricing into the new year as we started to see a good number of vendors really come out with pretty significant increase. Just any commentary on the pricing environment as we move into '21?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Well, so -- and I think this is 1 where you really need to segment. There have been a few categories that have been -- where supply-demand has been impacted by the pandemic that have had very large cost increases and everybody's taking price increases on those categories. And we are no different.  In general, inflation is still fairly modest, and we think that price cost mix will be neutral over time and maybe a little better given our starting position. So we aren't seeing -- we're seeing, in some categories, huge cost increases and everybody is adjusting prices on those. And then for the rest, we're seeing modest price inflation, and we are seeing some early signs of pretty decent price cost mix.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: So we've been talking about the inventory mark-to-market a fair bit. I'm just wondering if there's any way you could quantify, in dollar terms, how much inventory still kind of being held, just to try and help us think about the divestment. I think my real question is more on the growth algorithm for non-pandemic sales in '21, and you obviously provided some detail on Slides 14, 15. But if we think about it as a proxy for MRO, let's call it, 4% to 5% recovery in '21, you expect to grow 300 basis points over that number. Is that the right framework?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. That is generally the right framework. Again, we would, year-over-year, be hampered a little bit because of some of the outgrowth. We said 250 basis point outgrowth that was really onetime orders. But yes, that's generally the long-term framework. And then -- sorry, you asked a question at the beginning there. The short answer is that the curve that we showed on I think on Slide 15 takes the account sort of what we think the risks are with any inventory. So that is already embedded in that curve.
Nigel Coe: Okay. And then just on Zoro operating margin improvements and the remerchandising. Just so I understand this kind of model. Do you basically earn a commission on the remerchandising sales? So essentially, the more volumes you're remerchandising, the better your kind of fixed cost absorption, SG&A absorption, and that's what drives the margin expansion?
Donald Macpherson: Well, let me clarify a few things there, and I think I can answer the question in the process. So when we've talked about remerchandising as a priority, that is mostly in the Grainger brand. So that is mostly making sure that we have very highly curated product data so it is easier for our customers and team members to find product than anybody else on the roughly 2 million items we would have in the U.S.  With Zoro, we are expanding the offer. You don't have as much curation with that model. You couldn't possibly, given the number of SKUs we have. What happens when you add SKUs is you get growth. And you get customer acquisition first, and then you're able to get repeat buy. And that does not add much expense to the business. So you do, as you grow, get fixed cost leverage with that investment in product SKUs. That isn't the full story. Part of the full story is we're also growing with existing customers and getting repeat buy, and that adds to some of the fixed cost leverage as well. Hopefully, that answers the question, Nigel.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. .
Adam Uhlman: Congrats Dee. I wanted to start on SG&A expense, and thanks for providing all the detail on the first quarter. That's very helpful. I guess, we're still going to be -- you're expecting to be down meaningfully in the first quarter. But then we start to cycle some pretty easy comps from the temporary savings.  I guess, could you help us dimension how we should be thinking about the rest of the year? How big is the reset of incentive comp. And then presumably, we'll be traveling at some point in the second half of the year, should we expect a big step-up in Grainger's expenses related to that, maybe just flesh out the SG&A outlook.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I think I'll turn it over to Dee in a minute. I think in general, we don't expect to have sort of a big step-up through the year. The comps may look unfavorable. As a reminder, we went into this with the opinion that the virus was going to be a little longer-lived than we wanted, for sure, but that we would come out of it and need to operate. So we did not take a whole bunch of draconian actions. We prioritized what we did. We -- I think we will continue to prioritize more tightly what we're working on, which has taken some cost out. Obviously, travel -- some of the travel budget will come back maybe the second half, maybe not. Hard to really tell given where we're at right now. But not all of it. And so we feel like we're still going to have very tight cost control and be able to achieve leverage. But Dee, do you want to provide any color on that?
Deidra Merriwether: Yes. I think you said most of it there, but I would just say, generally, I think our long-term view to have SG&A be at half the rate of sales will be the continued focus. But this year is going to be kind of wait and see. And as D.G. noted, we're very focused on being very prudent with our costs. And I think it's all going to really depend upon how this pandemic progresses. But I think we would slowly start to see expenses tick up as we get closer to normal levels. But -- of activity in the overall market with our customers. But if we don't see us getting back to normal, we will still be very prudent with our expenses.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. Got you. And then, I guess, D.G., you were mentioning the like kind of new customer wins, it sounds like a lot of more sticky relationships. Is there any way that you can dimension retention of new customers that you've got, like repeat buyers, folks you haven't done business with? Or any data you could share on like active account growth that could help us better understand kind of this -- the market outgrowth that you delivered this past year?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, so just to -- in terms of contribution to revenue, I would say new customers, repeat rates were good. They're still a fairly small portion of the outgrowth, but we think it gives us a chance to -- we certainly grew the customer file. We don't -- we typically provide that information with Zoro. With Grainger, we don't often provide too many details on that. I will say the customer file is bigger and we have more repeat buy customers that were new in 2020 than we've had in years. So -- and I'd also say, to be honest, we're getting a handle on what that means and how to make -- convert them to be consistently buying customers. So it's a little early to understand sort of the long-term impacts of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS.
Christopher Snyder: So just following up on safety or pandemic. This was a very sizable $1.6 billion business prior to the pandemic. So I guess my question is, how did this legacy business trend in 2020? Just so we can try to separate out the underlying business from the surge or new business that came online over the last year, just to help model out the trajectory. Because I would assume that the underlying business carries more leverage to the industrial economy than the surge business that came on.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So that's a great question and mostly unanswerable, I would say. So let me give you some customer examples to give you a sense. So when the pandemic hit in Q2 of 2020, we are the largest industrial safety supplier. We are used to selling things like N95. We are not used to selling N95 to hospitals, just to be clear. Hospitals haven't historically been big users of N95. N95s typically go into places like grain elevators and dirty manufacturing processes. So all of a sudden, all of our product was being shifted to hospitals and governments.  We have gotten back to a more normal mix across what we call pandemic product than we did before, but I think there's still a lot of messiness. There's still a lot of customers in the industrial economy that haven't come back and aren't using safety products maybe like they did before if they don't have the activity. So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is super hard to get at.  And I would also point out that there's a lot of safety products, even in hospital systems. Hospital systems, this year, have done incredible things to protect people, to save people. They have been unable to do a lot of the historical safety maintenance things that they might have done. They just have been full out -- many of them have been full out on COVID. And there's a backlog of things that they will need to do, fundings available, that they just haven't done.  So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is really hard. And I'm sorry to give you some anecdotes. But certainly, I have a lot of them, where I think there is some pent-up demand for normal pandemic product.
Christopher Snyder: No. I appreciate all of that. And then just kind of following up, could you provide some color or numbers around the margin difference between pandemic and the non-pandemic revenues? Just as we try to model out this margin trajectory into 2021 as that shift normalizes?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, if -- and we haven't provided that. I will say that the $0.5 billion in non-pandemic that we were short in 2020, that probably has normal increment/decrement numbers that you've seen from us. The $800 million in pandemic that we sold above normal would have a lot lower incremental margins; quite a bit lower, maybe less than half, as you think about it, which sort of gets you to what happened to our overall slight decline in operating earnings for the full year. So that may be a way to sort of to allow you to sort of hunt and think about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. .
Patrick Baumann: You covered a lot of ground on the short term. I just wanted to move on to the long-term growth and algorithm for a second, where you're targeting, I think, low double-digit earnings growth and high single-digit revenue growth. Can you give us a high-level view on the moving parts margins within this, particularly how we should think about gross margins over the medium-term once this mix dynamic from pandemic normalizes? And then just kind of the puts and takes within that?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. For the company -- and you can keep me honest if I say anything that doesn't make any sense. For the company, we expect the U.S. business, the high-touch model, to have fairly consistent, if not, consistent margins, gross margins over time. We expect to have SG&A growing at half the rate of growth. And that's kind of the earnings algorithm for that model. We expect the -- our model to continue to grow much faster than the rest at something like 20%.  If you just include the fact that those gross profits are lower than the average, that has a roughly 20-basis-point impact on the overall. So you might see a slight decline in overall GP and a slight decline in overall s G&A, given that, that business also has lower SG&A, but it should be fairly stable once we get through this.
Patrick Baumann: And then as a follow-up to that. Go ahead, Dee. I'm sorry.
Deidra Merriwether: No. Again, I was just going to add to D.G. that I would agree with that. And that coming out of the pandemic, I think we would look for a much more stable and potentially more accretive margins on the high-touch than what we've seen over the pandemic.
Patrick Baumann: And just as a follow-up to that, I guess I'm a little surprised that you would expect the high-touch to have, just given some of the growth initiatives relative to maybe KeepStock and on-site and stuff like that where margins tend to be lower. Maybe just talk about how you're positioned competitively to expand those parts of the business and kind of hold your margins -- gross margins.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So I would point out that we continue to see -- and even the last quarter, we continue to see very strong results from our midsized customers. So even if there's some pressure with large customers, we expect growth of midsized customers to continue to exceed that. And so that should help us there too.
Deidra Merriwether: And they use less services like -- something like KeepStock, those types of services.
Donald Macpherson: Higher GP, less services, and so, higher margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.
Hamzah Mazari: Just sticking with the medium customer initiative, D.G., maybe you could talk about sort of what kind of growth to expect in 2021? I know I guess it was 6% in Q4. And whether that's sort of baked into your gross margin assumption of exiting sort of at pre-pandemic levels in Q4 2021. I guess just what's baked into your assumption on medium customer growth within that gross margin sort of trajectory?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Yes. I think there's a few dynamics. One is that in 2020, I think it's important to recognize that, particularly in the second quarter. We -- because of how we prioritize supporting health care systems and governments, we had less product for a while there with midsized customers. So our midsized customer business took a bit of a dip. There were also more closed midsized businesses during that period. We've seen that slowly come back, not fully back yet, but we do expect normalcy with midsized customers, and we have baked in significant share gain with that group. We don't have huge outgrowth in 2021. The pandemic, we think, is going to be a factor in the first half of the year, but we think we will exit the year with the midsized customers growing faster than March, which does -- which is baked into our gross profit assumption.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question, and congrats, Dee, again on the new role. Just on Zoro U.K., is that a business that can scale up? I know we talk a lot about Zoro U.S., but just any thoughts there.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, I'd say, yes, is the answer. We -- the business has done well in terms of customer acquisition, revenue path. It's got a healthy gross profit for a business that's relatively new. And Masaya and the team are working hard to make that a scalable business, and we still have some positive expectation there that, that is going to be a success story. As you know, the U.K. market was probably more impacted this year than some others. But certainly, we've seen continued growth through this cycle with our U.K. business and a lot of good signs.  So good. Well, thanks. I really appreciate everybody's questions. I'll just close by reiterating: We're viewing the pandemic is a likely two year events, and we expect to gain a lot of share during those two years, and we expect to have very strong economics exiting out of that. And I want to thank our team members and our customers for all we've worked together on to really put ourselves in a good position to have great relationships. Moving forward, and it's been an all hands on deck effort. So thanks to everybody. And I hope you stay safe, and I hope to see you, at some point, in person. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-22 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q3 press release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the third quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release.  Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Market conditions remained challenging in the third quarter as the pandemic conditions improved but continued to weigh on many of our customers. Amidst these challenges, Grainger performed well, continuing to demonstrate our resilience and strength. I'm so proud of how Grainger team members have responded to the challenges of 2020, staying relentlessly focused on further deepening relationships with our customers and supporting each other.  I've shared with you our Grainger edge framework, which includes our purpose, aspiration, strategy and the principles that define the behaviors we expect from all team members. These principles, including starting with the customer, acting with intent and competing with urgency, provide clarity and focus as we continue to execute on our purpose to keep the world working. And we'll continue to leverage the Grainger edge in all that we do throughout this pandemic and beyond.  So let me start off with a brief business update and an overview of our third quarter performance before turning it over to Tom to dive into the details. On the business side, we continue to serve our customers well to support the needs and safety of our team members and ensure we remain in a strong financial position. A quick update on each point. Grainger has operated effectively throughout the pandemic, first in support of essential businesses and now in serving all businesses. Each of our customers has a unique story on how they have been impacted by and managed through the pandemic. We have been there for all of them. Sales to health care, government and e-commerce businesses remained strong in the quarter, and we saw improving trends with manufacturing and commercial customers. I'll address the pattern of revenue in a moment.  Our world-class integrated supply chain organization, which supports both our North American high-touch businesses and our Zoro endless assortment platform, has helped find and secure products to meet customer demand. We have successfully worked down our backlog of orders for most pandemic-related products, including masks, and continue to work with suppliers to catch up on a few categories that remain scarce, including some gloves and hand sanitizers. The team remains laser-focused on maintaining our high level of customer service. Customer feedback has been strong and improving throughout the pandemic.  For our team members, we continue to take steps to support not only their safety but their overall well-being during this uncertain time. To date, we have managed the challenges of 2020 without major layoffs and currently have roughly 1% of our workforce still on furlough. Importantly, we've maintained a strong financial position. We've been diligent in controlling costs while balancing the need to continue to serve our customers, support our team members and invest where it matters most. Our strong performance over the last 2 quarters, together with our solid cost containment, have enabled us to relax a number of our short-term cash preservation actions. We exited the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in available liquidity.  We continue to make strong progress on our strategic growth priorities during the short-term uncertainty. We have continued to execute our transform merchandising process to drive significant user experience improvements to grainger.com, including our search and visualization capabilities and enriched product descriptions and content. By the end of 2020, we expect to have remerchandised $2.8 billion in product through this new process, including $1.6 billion in the year alone. We intend to further accelerate these efforts moving forward as a result of our new product information management system that launched in the third quarter. Customer feedback on our website has improved significantly over the past 6 quarters.  Marketing has been a large contributor of our U.S. share gain over the last few years. We have improved effectiveness in both media advertising and paid search and plan to further invest in marketing given these strong returns. We continue to deepen relationships with our customers to our large customer multisite growth initiative, enhancements to our KeepStock offering and improvements to our sales strategy and effectiveness. We know that when we embed one or more of our service offerings with our customers, we foster deeper and longer-lasting relationships. Over 60% of our U.S. revenue is generated from customers with one or more embedded solution.  And lastly, within our endless assortment model, we are executing the successful MonatoRO playbook at Zoro here in the U.S. and are making strides in marketing effectiveness, customer analytics and SKU additions. This year alone, we have added 1.5 million SKUs to Zoro, pushing its assortment to roughly 5 million products.  Turning to our quarterly performance. We produced strong operating results in the third quarter. Organic daily sales finished up 4.6% in the quarter, underpinned by growth in our U.S. high-touch business and continued impressive performance of our endless assortment model. In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader MRO market as a whole, which was down 5% to 6% in the quarter. Our gains were supported by pandemic-related demand, sales to new customers and improved sales of nonpandemic product as we started to see some stabilizing trends in underlying business activity. Overall business activity still trails pre-pandemic levels as some customers remain disrupted by COVID.  The endless assortment model continues to deliver with 20% growth in the third quarter, while also generating meaningfully improved margins. We remain very excited about the future of this business as we continue to adopt learnings from MonatoRO to drive growth and profitability. At the total company level, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 90 basis points as gross margin stabilized sequentially and we demonstrated strong cost control. Tom will detail this in a bit. The business continues to produce a durable cash flow stream with operating cash flow of $311 million and free cash flow of $252 million.  Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important to again show this chart to highlight the underlying trends with pandemic and nonpandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Our characterization goes beyond traditional safety products to include product categories with substantial volume increases during the pandemic. Flexiglass barriers will be an example. As you can see, while sales of pandemic-related products have decreased since May, continued demand for key products, including masks, gloves and cleaning supplies, has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year. This heightened demand has continued to come from a multitude of new and existing customers across numerous industries as businesses reopen and adjust to the new operating protocols.  On the nonpandemic side, sales have improved since bottoming out in April, with nonpandemic sales now down about 7% year-over-year. This improvement has been seen across most industries with some of the obvious industries remaining the furthest below their pre-pandemic levels. These include airlines, hotels and cruise lines. Based on month-to-date performance, we forecast October sales to finish up around 2% for the U.S. segment on continued trends in pandemic and nonpandemic performance.  Predicting the recovery over the next few quarters is very challenging. The path of the virus will have a big impact on whether the recent improvements continue, level off or reverse, but we feel well positioned to compete in any environment that comes our way.  With that, I will turn it over to Tom to talk us through the quarter's results in detail. Tom?
Thomas Okray: Thanks, D.G. Starting on Slide 8, you can see we delivered strong results in the quarter. Organic daily sales, which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory in China, were up 4.6% on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by share gains in our U.S. segment and continued impressive growth in our endless assortment business, which was up over 20% in the quarter. These gains more than offset pandemic-related softness in our Canada and Cromwell businesses, where we saw meaningfully higher sales sequentially but still remain well below pre-pandemic levels.  Gross margin for the total company was down 170 basis points versus the prior year quarter, but represented a 120 basis point improvement from the second quarter year-over-year decline. Margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds, primarily in our U.S. segment as well as continued unit -- business unit mix impact as we experienced significant growth in our endless assortment business.  Our SG&A came in at $700 million in the third quarter, better than our communicated range of $715 million to $730 million. SG&A cost was down $60 million year-over-year, and we captured 260 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period. This result stems from prudent cost reduction actions across our high-touch solutions model, including cost -- lower costs as a result of our Fabory divestiture and leverage gains with our endless assortment business. This SG&A performance more than overcame GP headwinds to drive a 90 basis point improvement in total company operating margins for the quarter, a tremendous result in this environment. Incremental margins were up 50% in the quarter. As mentioned last quarter, the utility of the incremental and decremental margin calculation is diminished in this uncertain environment as the metric can vary significantly given the magnitude of top line swings from quarter-to-quarter.  We generated operating cash flow of $311 million, which we used to continue to invest in the business, build appropriate inventory to support our customers and return capital to shareholders. Operating cash flow was 126% of net adjusted earnings, and year-to-date adjusted return on invested capital is over 29%. Given our solid results of the last couple of quarters, combined with stabilizing trends in underlying business activity, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility, increased our dividend payment and are announcing today our intent to restart our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate putting several hundred million dollars to work on repurchases in Q4, we will monitor market conditions and optimize the amount accordingly. The favorable trends over the last several months give us confidence that this is the right time to move forward with these actions.  Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.1% in the quarter, driven primarily by volume, which is net of unfavorable product mix. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products remained elevated, up 53% in the quarter, but as shown earlier, have tapered off from the peak in March. Nonpandemic products were down around 8% in the quarter, but continued to show meaningful improvement from April lows. We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions with some really encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we saw improved growth with both large and midsized customers, with the latter growing 6% in the quarter, an improvement from the 6% decline year-over-year we saw in Q2 2020.  Gross margins of 36.4% was down 160 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019, but improved sequentially from the 310 basis point year-over-year decline we saw in the second quarter of 2020. The unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven by -- mainly by 2 factors that were similar to the second quarter, pandemic-related product headwinds and tariff-fueled cost inflation. Pandemic-related headwinds contributed about 140 basis points of the gross margin decline as we continue to see unfavorable product and customer mix due to elevated sales of lower-margin pandemic product.  Beyond the pandemic impact, we continue to face pressure in the quarter due to the lapping of year-over-year cost inflation, which was driven partially by tariffs that went into effect in 2019. This drove approximately 80 basis points of year-over-year margin decline. Based on what we know now, we expect that both of these gross margin headwinds will continue into the fourth quarter. It should be noted that we anticipate the tariff headwinds will fully subside as we move into 2021. Offsetting these two factors in the quarter was a 60 basis points tailwind related to favorable freight costs driven by nonrecurring shipping efficiencies and timing. We do not expect these freight dynamics to continue in the fourth quarter.  From an SG&A perspective, we gained 160 basis points of leverage with cost decreasing approximately $22 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower labor-related costs and general operating efficiencies. Operating margin remained flat to the prior year quarter at 15.1% as SG&A leverage offset gross margin headwinds. Return on invested capital was a very healthy 38%.  Drilling into our U.S. sales performance on Slide 10. While we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 5% and 6% in the third quarter, Grainger was able to capture roughly 850 basis points of outgrowth, fueled by pandemic-related sales, selling to new customers and improving sales of nonpandemic product. Despite the challenges of 2020, U.S. segment daily sales are up 2.1% year-to-date, and we have outgained the broader MRO market by over 900 basis points through the first 9 months of 2020.  Moving to our Other Businesses. Organic daily sales increased 12.5% or 12.3% on a constant currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at approximately 20%, fueled by strong results at both MonatoRO and Zoro during the quarter. Zoro continues to execute the MonatoRO playbook with improvements to marketing effectiveness, discounting strategies and better cost leverage, all helping to drive improved performance. Although we saw significant sequential improvement compared to the second quarter, our international high-touch businesses continue to be impacted by pandemic-related shutdowns with both Mexico and Cromwell seeing year-over-year declines.  Operating margins for Other Businesses are up 190 basis points, 35 basis points which is due to the divestiture of our Fabory and China businesses, which produced below system average profitability in the prior year. The remaining operating margin favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage across the portfolio, most notably within our endless assortment business, which continues to do a nice job levering its cost base. This leverage was only partially offset by gross profit headwinds from incremental freight costs at MonatoRO  Turning to Slide 12. In Canada, daily sales decreased 9.9% or 9.1% in constant currency. The decline is comprised of roughly 8% decline in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately 1%. While volumes in Canada continued to be impacted by the pandemic-driven economic slowdown, the business did improve sequentially and is gaining traction with hospitals, manufacturing and higher-education customers. As the Canadian business continues to integrate and leverage our U.S. resources, we are making progress with our customer diversification efforts and are pleased with the trajectory of this business going forward.  Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 35 basis points year-over-year, driven by pandemic-related mix headwinds, which were offset partially by lower freight costs in the quarter. Cost management remains strong with savings of $5 million year-over-year, resulting in 110 basis points of SG&A leverage. Total operating margins were up 75 basis points versus prior year despite the top line challenges.  Before I turn it back to D.G., similar to the last couple of quarters, I want to give you a sense of how we're thinking about things in the fourth quarter. From a sales perspective, month-to-date trends support our estimate for October year-over-year sales growth to be up over 4% at the total company level on an organic constant currency basis. This October month end estimate is reflective of continued solid growth in our U.S. segment, coupled with strong performance in endless assortment.  From a gross margin perspective, as I previously mentioned, we anticipate gross margin pressure will continue as the pandemic-related impacts and tariff-fueled cost inflation headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. The onetime freight tailwind we realized in the third quarter will fall off. Further, we anticipate year-over-year cost headwinds in the fourth quarter as the already stretched global shipping providers pass through freight surcharges during the busy holiday season. Given these factors and based on what we are currently seeing, we anticipate gross margins will be down over 200 basis points year-over-year.  With respect to SG&A, we expect to see sequential increases in a couple of areas, primarily related to some incremental technology investments to support growth in the U.S. and at MonatoRO, which will push our estimated SG&A to between $725 million to $740 million for the fourth quarter. As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in long-term growth, particularly in people, processes and technology where and when it makes sense.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. So I'm proud of our results for the quarter, and I want to thank our team members for their commitment to safety and customer service.  We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing capabilities, deepened our customer relationships, expanded our assortment while improving margins at Zoro and have significant financial flexibility to support the business moving forward. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as continuing to execute our strategy, so we can achieve this purpose for years to come.  And with that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Chris Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: I was curious, you mentioned the customer acquisition trend still going strong and conversions to some regular customer dynamics are going well. Just wondering if you could further dive into that topic and how it informs early view of share outperformance for '21?
Donald Macpherson: Great. Thanks, Chris. So yes, so we've had -- as you might guess, given inventory positions, we have had a whole bunch of new customers sample Grainger and Zoro and MonatoRO, frankly, as we've had elevated customer acquisitions through this period. The good news is that those who have repeated, the number is much higher than in the past. The repeat rates are similar to the past, but we have a much bigger funnel, and we're starting to get those customers to be regular purchasing customers. So we've seen really nice, attractive customer acquisition through this period, and we think that really helps bode well for the future. We feel very confident in our 300 to 400 basis point outgrowth in the U.S. business and the 20% growth expectations for the endless assortment, and we have no reason to change those right now. This year, we've obviously been higher than that number in the U.S. We would expect to be in that range and shoot for higher, but be in that range moving forward.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then for follow-up. I think the -- would you anticipate that 3Q pandemic sales using October as a proxy might approximate the sustainable run rates as long as workplaces are very germaphobic? Or is that still way too in flux?
Donald Macpherson: I think that's a very interesting question, and I don't think anybody has the answer. What we're seeing right now is elevated pandemic sales. We expect that to continue. And certainly, as case rates rise, which we've seen recently, we would expect that to continue through the fall. What happens when we have better treatments and a vaccine is probably a question that is all in our minds, and it's probably impossible to answer. We would expect some of that to moderate, but we do think people are going to be more conscious of safety and cleanliness for some period after that as well. But for now, we're seeing similar trends to what we've seen in the past. We would expect that to continue in the fall, given the rate of transmission.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Chris Dankert from Longbow Research.
Christopher Dankert: I guess, first off, what's the status of investment in Zoro? I mean in the past, we'd mentioned you had $50 million of investment in '19. It largely rolls off this year, I guess. Are we still on pace to get to mid-single-digit EBIT margin plus in the Other Business in '21? Just thoughts on investment there would be really helpful, I think.
Donald Macpherson: Sure. So we had a very heavy investment period in the back half of '18 and '19 with Zoro. Many of those -- those investments took several forms. One was technology. Another was people in getting the talent to be able to have their own destiny in terms of product adds and the like. And so we made those investments. Those investments are behind us. We start to see those -- starting to see those leverage themselves now. This year, we're getting improved operating margins in Zoro. We think the long-term path for Zoro from a margin perspective is as we've discussed. We'll talk about next year in January, but we have no reason to believe the positivity that we've seen won't continue, and we still think that is going to be a high single-digit operating margin business in the next several years. And so that's the path for that business.
Christopher Dankert: Got it. Got it. And then thinking about SG&A, I mean, compared to what the guidance was, again, coming in below that range. My apologies if I missed it, but just what were the key moving parts on what helps you kind of cut that SG&A number even lower in the third quarter here?
Thomas Okray: Yes. Thanks.
Donald Macpherson: Tom, do you want to take that?
Thomas Okray: Yes, sure. Thanks, Chris. First of all, there was a little bit that was win dated just with the Fabory divestiture, and that takes the $60 million down to about $40 million. But then we just had real good efficiency across the board. Everything from travel and entertainment, professional services, cleaning supply, security, just a real good focus by the team in terms of efficiency and cost control. And one of the great things with the pandemic is we've always been cost conscious, but I think we've really upped our game. And I think it's going to continue going forward where we're really in this mode of operating this way. So just to summarize, really good cost control across the board while continuing to spend in advertising and technology, which are important for us.
Christopher Dankert: Got it. Glad to hear it that it's a broad-based savings, certainly. So congrats again on the quarter.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.
Adam Uhlman: Sticking with the SG&A question, I guess the freight dynamics that you pointed out for the third quarter and the fourth quarter are pretty interesting. As the surcharge rate kind of transition into base rate increases, I'm wondering if you could help us ballpark just how meaningful of a headwind that could be for 2021? Or perhaps it's not a headwind, and you have some other levers to pull to offset that? And maybe you could just remind us about how you charge customers for freight. I believe most customers don't pay, but maybe discuss that as well.
Donald Macpherson: So I would say that it's a great question. Most customers -- our largest customers and contract customers often don't pay for parcel. They often pay for LTL or large shipments. The surcharge that Tom was referring to is really around large packages during the peak season, and we will charge for some of that. We expect to recoup some of that. We don't expect to recoup all of that. And that doesn't have much to do with what happens into next year. So we'll talk about next year, obviously, after this quarter. I would say, certainly, the freight business, given the number of shipments going to people's houses, has become strained, and we've seen some pressure. That does not mean though that the surcharges that happened in the fall necessarily translate going forward, and so we'll talk about that. And we think we've got initiatives and actions to help mitigate that moving forward, but we'll talk about that at the end of the year.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. Great. That's good to hear. And then secondly, the company has been building up inventory. And I was curious, one, if you could talk about your inventory and working capital assumptions here in the medium term? And then secondly, if you are concerned at all of absorbing losses on any pandemic inventory that you might be taking if we have some good luck and the pandemic starts to roll off and market pricing deteriorates further?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So let me take those. And Tom, you can add to them if you think I miss anything. So in terms of inventory, there's really 2 areas where we've built inventory, and we'll continue to do so through the latter part of the year. The first one is sort of normal, which is we are starting the Louisville DC full up in 2021. And so as that comes on, we obviously stock that building. That's partially stocked now, but becomes more fully stocked as we go through, and that's a part of what you've seen. The other part is pre-buys for pandemic-related product. I would say to your question about do we have risk on excess obsolescence with that product, part of what you see in terms of -- with us in terms of pandemic GP already embeds some write-downs.  We obviously, to make sure we could serve our customers, took positions at a whole bunch of products in the height of the pandemic. And some of those, the price/cost has changed. Some of those, we haven't seen movement. In a lot of those, we've seen movement, and it's gone very well. But in that messiness to serve customers, which we think has been really, really important, you're already seeing that in some of the GP rates that you're seeing is us take that. We think that we're in good position. Most of the inventory build, to be clear, has been pre-buys on product that has very low risk. We know suppliers, we know product, we know product that will sell in any case, but trying to get out ahead of that in case the fall and the winter is really, really bad. And so most of that is not higher risk than normal. But certainly, in some of the speculative buys and things we took in the heart of the pandemic, you've already seen some of that come through in terms of GP.
Thomas Okray: Yes. And just to add a little bit more color on inventory and cash. One of the things that we've been very efficient on is our management of cash, and you've seen that in this quarter. More specifically, our cash conversion cycle, our DSO is actually down year-over-year a couple of days. And our DPO is actually favorable by more than a few days, which has allowed us to keep an overall cash conversion cycle that is very healthy versus last year and invest in the inventory. So we can play our role as an essential business and support the customers the way we need to. So you're right. Inventory is up since the beginning of the year, 8% at $1.78 billion. We've invested in working capital. It's up $220 million. And we did put pandemic inventory spend in the quarter of approximately $300 million. And as D.G. said, I mean, you're not going to bat 1,000 on all of that. So we go through the normal E&O process. And I guess the way I would describe it is we're very aggressive operationally, but very conservative financially. So doing the right thing to reserve. So thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Chris Snyder from UBS.
Christopher Snyder: I just wanted to follow-up on endless assortment margins. I understand there's like a longer-term kind of high single-digit target out there for Zoro. But with the back-office investment slowing, what kind of incremental margins could we expect for this business as the top line continues to ramp?
Thomas Okray: Yes. It's a good question. We really don't look at incremental margins specifically on the endless assortment business just because the supply chain is so intertwined in the synergies with the broader business. So we really look at the business as the incremental margin for the overall entity.
Donald Macpherson: I mean, Tom, I would just add. I mean, if you look at incremental margins with MonatoRO, typically, you're talking about a 15% to 20%, which is just GP minus the variable marketing cost. And so I would expect us to get to something like that over time at Zoro. But that's typically what we see in MonatoRO, I think.
Christopher Snyder: Appreciate that. And then just following up on MonatoRO. So like the stock is like 100% year-to-date in Tokyo last I checked. Can you just talk about how you kind of view that business strategically at Grainger?
Donald Macpherson: So we view both the endless assortment and the high-touch solutions model as absolutely core to what we do. Masaya Suzuki, who's the leader of that business now, also leads Zoro. We are sharing best practices and analytics and working together to ensure that we're actually making progress across those 2 businesses and our Zoro business in the U.K. as well. So we view it as absolutely core to what we do right now. And we're getting a whole lot of leverage from that MonatoRO team in terms of learnings and building the business in Zoro for the future. So we are running those very, very tightly together at this point.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: I was hoping we get some color on the -- additional color on the gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter down 200 bps. Is there any way you can parse out what the pandemic sales would be versus non pandemic sales? We're just trying to get a sense of what the core gross margin trajectory might be.
Thomas Okray: Yes. I think the way to look at it, Deane, is we said the pandemic impact is 140 basis points for this quarter, and the cost other is 80 basis point unfavorable bad guy, and we had the onetime freight of 60. So if you remove the 60 from the 140 and the 80, you get to 220. Now we think that the pandemic will likely improve. Obviously, it's very volatile. Say you get roughly a 20% improvement on your cost inflation as well as your pandemic, that gets you to around 200-ish. And then you throw in the freight headwinds that we think we might experience at the end of the year, as D.G. discussed, with the surcharges, and that gets you above 200.
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. And then I was hoping to get some additional color on the October sales. Just to the extent that you can, anything that you think would be helpful regarding geographic, customer sizes, anything else about the mix, that would be a big help here.
Donald Macpherson: I think, Deane, if you looked at sales revenue performance July, August, September, October, you'd be hard pressed to see much of a difference across those months. We've seen a little tail off in pandemic and a little improvement in nonpandemic. But pretty much, the trend has been very, very similar across all of those months. So the trends we've seen and the performance we saw in the second quarter really just appears to be -- in the third quarter appears to be continuing in October at this point.
Deane Dray: Got it. And just lastly, an observation. I've certainly heard the Grainger spot adds on business radio pretty frequently in the brand building. So I guess pretty effective.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: I want to pick up on that 4Q gross margin guidance. So roughly 200 basis points down from 38% last quarter gets it to about 36%, which would be up from this quarter. So I just wanted to make sure that, that math kind of still holds that we're looking for what would be a fairly normal sequential pickup in gross margin percentage from 3Q.
Donald Macpherson: Tom, do you want to take that one?
Thomas Okray: I think another way to look at it is our absolute gross margin should be very similar to Q3. And then when you just look at the comparison to prior year, it's going to bump it over 200. So that's the other way I would look at it.
Nigel Coe: Okay. No, that's fair. And then the midsize customer growth was pretty impressive and a nice swing from what we saw last quarter. And I'm just curious, are we seeing -- obviously, a lot of your competitors, especially the small competitors and 1 of 2 larger ones, employ a very high-touch distribution model. And I'm wondering if we're seeing a switch towards perhaps more low-touch, direct ship e-commerce type sales and maybe some supply consolidation? I mean anything you see in there in the market?
Donald Macpherson: Well, yes, I would say we've certainly seen more digital sales through the pandemic. I think we've seen that in almost every industry and ours has been no different. What I would say is that we are seeing improvements in midsize customer growth from digital actions but also from inside sales actions. So that is more of a touch, but we're seeing nice growth across both of those contact points. And so yes, I would say it's fair to characterize as more digital, but not all digital. We're also seeing some nice growth through some of our other actions that are more high touch.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Just a couple of questions. I was -- covered a lot of ground already, but one thing I want to be sure on, if you don't mind. Tom, on endless assortment, clearly some good leverage happening there. But just wondering if anything is happening inside of Zoro or MonatoRO, for that matter, with mix. Obviously, in the middle of pandemic, we can talk about like pandemic mix and safety products. But I guess, just more broadly, are people buying different stuff than that is normally tuned up for? And does that have some benefit, positive or negative, that may not look like the ongoing model?
Thomas Okray: Yes. I think the only thing that I would say, and then, D.G., please add, is we're probably seeing more B2C customers than B2B customers in the pandemic. But other than that, nothing out of the ordinary.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So one of the things that I would say that's muddled the pandemic a little bit in terms of results has been with so many people working from home, sometimes, the business and the consumer tends to blur. I've listened to a bunch of contact center calls. And it's fascinating that there's a lot of people at home may be buying things for businesses, but also sometimes delivering to their home. And so we think we've had more consumer acquisition than normal. We don't remarket to consumers, whether in Zoro or Grainger. And what we do know is that the business customer acquisition has been very solid, very strong. And the attractiveness of those customers has been every bit as strong as we've seen in the past. So we're happy with -- besides having to sort of sift through consumer business, the business, the [indiscernible] business has been very strong, and that's been that sort of key for us.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then it sounds like Deane is going to be a future customer here based on the effect of this marketing, so maybe you can close that lead.
Donald Macpherson: He's not the target segment, I can assure you that.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Understood. And then just on the inventory question. I know someone asked earlier about the inventory build there. Anything on kind of seasonally uncommon liquidation in the fourth quarter that you're planning that may be dragging that down or impacting that at all? Just thinking about historically, usually, you build a little inventory in the fourth quarter sequentially. Is that something that happened earlier? And is that playing into the -- that dynamic at all on the gross margin?
Thomas Okray: It's playing into it a little bit. As we said on the previous question, we've been very aggressively operationally from an inventory perspective because it's the right thing to do, and we want to have the product available for our customers. But on the other hand, we've been conservative financially. So part of the gross margin deterioration that you've seen in Q3 is an E&O headwind, cleaning up some of the buys that didn't exactly thread the needle. So we've tried to do most of that in Q3. We'll see a little bit in Q4 as well. And then we believe that that's going to be behind us going into 2021, we'll have the right product to serve our customer. And then if anything, we'll have a tailwind as we unwind some of those reserves when the products that we have reserved potentially will be available for sale.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from John Inch from Gordon Haskett.
John Inch: Assuming that PPE sales which you would assume, right, to happen as the market has been saturated naturally continued to trend lower, as we roll into 2021, what kind of a kind of an absolute sales headwind could this prospectively represent? And you guys have had very strong OpEx control. Kind of -- I don't think I've heard this in the discussion thus far. I mean, what kind of costs are you thinking about are going to have to come back next year as you sort of flip from PPE to kind of a more normalized volume trajectory for other products?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I think there's a lot in that question, John. I would say that we -- it's hard -- it's really difficult to project the PPE trend. What we've seen since April, in April, we saw PPE up almost 100% pandemic product, what we call pandemic that includes more than PPE. We saw sort of normal volumes down 20% in April. And what we've seen is those 2 sort of just come together consistently since that time. And there's lots of puts and takes to that. So if PPE comes down and we get a little bit better nonpandemic product, it helps GP, probably doesn't have any impact on SG&A, frankly. We think we can control SG&A in any environment. And one of the good things about the pandemic, and there haven't been many, is it really forces a business to focus, and I think we've really been focused on what matters. And I think that's something that we definitely need to take forward is how do we continue to focus on a few things that really matter, which helps drive results, but also helps you manage your SG&A. So we think we're going to be able to do that going forward. I can't give you a crystal ball answer as to what's going to happen with PPE because it just all depends on the timing of the virus and people's behavior, and we've never seen anything like this before.
John Inch: Right. But do you have any sense, D.G., of what maybe the SG&A -- I'm sorry, Tom, what sort of SG&A headwinds you're facing kind of on a quantifiable basis? Because you do have the 1% people that are furloughed, presumably going to have to bleed back a little bit of travel and some merit increases and stuff like that. Is it too early to tell at this point? Or how are you thinking about it?
Donald Macpherson: No. I mean we'll talk about that certainly at year-end as we talk about forward looking. We took -- we had merit increases this year. So that's not -- yes, clearly, we have costs that will come back into the business. Travel will be modest, we think, for the next 6 months, given what we're seeing with the virus. At some point, that can come back. But I think the headline for me would be, we've seen nice growth. GP has been depressed given pandemic sales has been so elevated. SG&A has been down. I think, over time, as that moderates, you get better GP and a little bit of cost back added into the business. And there's just a dynamic there that we can talk about later.
John Inch: I understand.
Thomas Okray: Yes. I'm sorry, the only thing that I would reinforce is, as D.G. said, we're always going to be about SG&A efficiency and control, and we'll handle that. The upside that I see which D.G. mentioned is we're going to see the gross margin pop from as the pandemic goes down. And also, I think on the sales front, as the broader economy opens up, we're going to be well positioned to ride that wave as well. And I would have to imagine, obviously it's speculation, that there's going to be a lot of PP&E product that's going to come into those businesses opening up as well. So I see it more as a tailwind than any sort of a headwind.
John Inch: D.G., just lastly, implicit in your answer on MonatoRO and monetizing MonatoRO, you indicated that Zoro is still pretty important to the Zoro business. It's intertwined and so forth. At what point can Zoro do you think stands on its own where you might strategically be in a position to say, hey, we don't need to own half of MonatoRO, the stock has done fantastic, let's take our position down to 20%, 30%, something like that or even to 0%?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I'd say a couple of things to that. One is it's probably timing, you probably need 3 more years, given what we're projecting to get Zoro to where we would like to get it. So it's really got the connected tissue to be a really strong performer for a long time. And so that's what we're shooting for. At that point, obviously, we could do things. There's all kinds of tax implications of that, John. And so we need to think through all that at that point. For now, for the next 3 years, we're thinking of it as we need to get Zoro business performing well. We're really excited about the MonatoRO path, and we think that's the right focus for us.
Operator: Our next question is coming from David Manthey from Baird.
David Manthey: Tom, I'll have to go back and review your commentary. But when you were talking about gross margin and you said above 200, I'm confused, was that a fourth quarter statement? Or were you walking into 2021?
Thomas Okray: Fourth quarter, Dave. The way I'm looking at it is just simple math. If you look at Q3, 160 bad guy on gross margin with a 60 bps of onetime freight. So if you just take the 60 bps up, that gets you to 220. Now we assume the pandemic is going to get better as is cost inflation, so bring that down to 200 or a little bit below. But then going back to the freight surcharges we see during the holiday season, that will get us back above 200, which is the framework that we talked about in the prepared remarks for Q4. Now having said that, I mean, it's very fluid. It's hard to predict. But we're just trying to give you guys some framework for your model.
David Manthey: Okay. Yes. That's very helpful. And so I'll ask the question. Gross margin is obviously extremely hard to model these days. And if we're just thinking big picture moving parts from where we're lined up in 2020, which looks like, I don't know, 30 -- low 36s. If you just were thinking big picture, what are the main moving parts as we go from 2020 to 2021 that could move that up or down?
Thomas Okray: Yes. We'll have a lot more to say about that going forward. I think, though, just to give you a couple of things to think about. One would be how long is the pandemic going to last? Because obviously, the longer the pandemic lasts, the more we're going to be depressed with pandemic-related mix and the type of customers we're selling to. So that's number one. Number two, we should see a natural tailwind in terms of we will have fully lapped the tariff-related cost inflation as well as we'll probably see less spikes in terms of cost inflation related to the pandemic product. So those are the 2 big ones to think about, and both of them should be tailwinds for 2021. But again, it's premature to talk in detail. We'll have plenty of time for that later.
David Manthey: Got it. That's great color. And then second, on KeepStock and these embedded solutions that you talk about making up 60% of revenues. Just to put that in context, what percentage of customers would that represent? And then recognizing that those customers obviously buy from -- via several mechanisms that you provide, could you talk about what percentage of sales are directly via the embedded solutions today?
Donald Macpherson: Well, so let me try to take that. So most of our largest complex customers will have embedded solutions. And typically, they'll have both a KeepStock inventory management solution and EDI Pro sort of connected digital solution as well. And so the EDI Pro and KeepStock would make up over 30% of our direct revenue, I believe. Don't quote me on it, something like that. I don't have that in the numbers right in front of me, it's something like that. In terms of number of customers, obviously, our midsized customers have fewer of those solutions. They're more to buying on grainger.com. And by the way, that can be pseudo embedded, although I call it embedded because they can have -- their own they have their own pricing, they may have their own workflow on grainger.com. But typically, they wouldn't have inventory management. And so from a customer count, the number of customers will be much fewer in that 60% than those in there, but the largest complex customers will all have an embedded solution in general.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Michael McGinn from Wells Fargo.
Michael McGinn: If I could just move to the low-touch segment. Can you talk about the sell-through rate of per site visit or any other tangible improvement for SKU recommendations, substitute or frequently packaged products and SKU count and what that's -- what's been the most impactful so far and what will be going forward?
Donald Macpherson: Are you talking about the endless assortment business, the Zoro business?
Michael McGinn: Yes. Yes, the endless assortment.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Yes. So I mean, I'd say there's three things that have been really impactful. One is SKU count. So we look at the productivity of every SKU add, and we look over kind of the last 6, 7 years as we've added SKUs. We're now -- we've now hit the 5 million points. The adds we've made in the last 6 months are as productive and it looks like maybe even more productive than those that we've made in the past. So that bodes pretty well for future growth. So that's probably the most important piece of the growth. The other one is customer analytics and marketing.  So getting customers, customer acquisition. The funnel is pretty big, but then getting customers to repeat is really the key. And we're doing all kinds of things there with analytics and marketing to get that second, third, fourth order and starting to get real traction there. So those are far and away the two most important things with the endless assortment business that we track, and we're seeing progress on both of those.
Michael McGinn: And how does it correlate to sales per site visit and what's kind of been the trend there?
Donald Macpherson: Sales per site visit. You mean customers coming on to the website and what's the revenue per site visit?
Michael McGinn: Yes. I guess what industry metrics are you benchmarking to within that and this assortment model? And what's been the improvement with this level of investment?
Donald Macpherson: So we look at things at other businesses would look at. The return on ad spend, that is interesting, but not sufficient. The most important thing is looking at customer value. And so looking at customer acquisition and the customer lifetime value. And so we look at new customer acquisition rates, repeat rates, and we link all that to a customer value model to understand the NPV of each customer ad. And so that's what we track all the time.
Michael McGinn: Got it. All right. On my second question, CapEx. Is there a normalized level of CapEx that you would be targeting in the out years as you transition less from branches more to endless assortment? Is there -- I mean, it looks like you're trending pretty well this year. Just wondering if there's -- if you underspent this year and there's a catch-up into next year or beyond?
Thomas Okray: Yes. I don't...
Donald Macpherson: Go ahead, Tom.
Thomas Okray: Yes. I don't think there's going to be any big catch-up. I mean, if you -- even if you look at, we spent roughly $60 million in the quarter, which was similar to last year. When the pandemic first hit, we tightened our belts a little bit and deferred some things. But given the confidence that we've had in the cash generation, we're back to normal spend levels. So I don't see any big wave coming in future years that would be anything out of the ordinary.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.
Hamzah Mazari: My question was just in the other segment, if you take out the endless assortment business, are those other businesses losing money today? Or are they profitable? And then is the endless assortment business now over 10% of revenue, where you have to sort of resegment that? Or is that not the right way to look at that?
Donald Macpherson: So on your second question, we are evaluating the need to think about any segmentation, and we'll talk about that and our position on that at the end of the year -- or with next year. So we are evaluating that, and we work with our auditors to make sure we understand requirements. So that's still to come. So there's different types of businesses that are in other when you take out endless assortment, but there's not a lot of them. So there's Mexico, that's profitable. There's Puerto Rico, that's profitable. And there's Cromwell, Cromwell is unprofitable now, but having a pretty good year in terms of customer service and experience, and they're losing less money this year than last. So in total, I believe those would be slightly unprofitable, but 2 of them are profitable and 1 is not and working on that one.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Justin Bergner from G. Research.
Justin Bergner: Quick clarification question, then a more open-ended question. The medium-sized customer growth going from negative 6% to 6%, how much of that related to those businesses sort of being closed in the second quarter or being unable to get pandemic-related product and then sort of catching up in the third quarter?
Donald Macpherson: So there are two things going on. One is some of those businesses were more impacted and may have been closed. I think the bigger issue was in the heat of the pandemic in April, May, in particular, given the way product supply happened for pandemic products and the customers we needed to funnel that product to, we didn't have product available for those customers. And in the summer, we relaxed that constraint as pandemic products became more available and we were able to open that up to that customer base. And so we've seen very strong growth since that happened. And I think that's probably the bigger issue is just being able to release the product for midsized customers, and we've seen nice growth as result.
Justin Bergner: Great. And then the open-ended question. Looking at it from a sort of customer grouping point of view, Grainger showed nice acceleration in the government and the retail channels. Maybe you could just sort of talk about anything unusual or potentially recurring that is going to sustain that trend and maybe in the context of just general outgrowth levers that may be materializing anew as you look towards the end of this year and into 2021?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I think it's important to understand what retail is. Retail is mostly distribution centers that go direct to customer. We don't do a lot of sort of walk-in retail business. We're more sort of the distribution centers that obviously have more safety needs and other needs. So that has obviously been growing as an industry as the pandemic has happened. And so we've been there supporting our customers through that. So that is a trend that we believe will continue as we move forward. What was the other -- I'm sorry, what was the other segment you mentioned?
Justin Bergner: Government accelerating, which would sort of be surprising in light of pandemic sales being decelerating.
Donald Macpherson: Well, yes, the government sales have been strong, and a lot of that has been pandemic as governments try to find product to support their communities during this time. And so that's a lot of state government business. Military has been okay as well for federal. But certainly, state governments have been very, very busy as each of them has tried to fight the pandemic, and we've been there trying to help as much as possible.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Patrick Baumann from JPMorgan.
Patrick Baumann: I just have a couple of quick ones here. [Technical Difficulty] just wondering if there's a way for you to quantify the amount of revenue from pandemic that could be a headwind to next year. It sounds like you still expect pretty good share gains and you said 300 to 400 basis points. But I just wanted to check to see if there's any major issues on that front in terms of the pandemic sales into next year.
Donald Macpherson: Well, I think we're definitely going to talk about that in January with our results, like I said before. Right now, and as we head into the winter, given what we're seeing with case counts, we expect pandemic sales to be elevated through the fall and into the winter. That would be our expectation. We will reevaluate as we go forward to really understand what the puts and takes are. But if pandemic sales go down, we think nonpandemic sales will go up because that would mean the pandemic isn't as much of a problem. And again, that helps our gross profit when that happens and probably overall profitability rates. So we don't really know. I think it's impossible to tell what's going to happen with pandemic products. At some point, it will be a headwind, but other things then won't be a headwind, and that's our expectation.
Patrick Baumann: Yes. Makes sense. And then last one real quick on Zoro. Are the added SKUs year-to-date, is that all third-party related? And since you're skewing mix more in that direction, I just want to check and see if there are any big differences in how you report the revenue or the margin or the type of margin you get when you ship third-party versus Grainger owned inventory.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So a lot of the new product adds are third party, some are through the Grainger supply chain. Third-party items tend to be lower SG&A and slightly lower margin -- gross margin. But most of the time, we're working with high-quality companies that have very good fulfillment capabilities. And so that's one of our important sorts as we develop partners that actually add to our assortment. So it's really no difference in how we report it, but it is going to be a bigger factor for us going forward. We're going to continue to add third-party shippers, and that's a big part of what we're doing.
Thomas Okray: Yes. The only thing I would add, Patrick, is the accounting difference is whether you're an agent or not when you're doing third party, but that's a minor nuance. So thanks for the question.
Operator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.
Donald Macpherson: All right. So this is D.G. So thanks, everyone, for joining us. Really appreciate it. We feel good about our results in the quarter. We feel really good about our forward prospects. Obviously, there's a ton of uncertainty in terms of how the market is going to evolve. And probably more than anybody, we'd like for the pandemic to be behind us, but we know it's not. And so we're going to make sure we continue to support our customers through this. That's the first and most important thing we're going to do. And we're going to make sure we take care of our team members, and we're going to make sure we do things that are prudent, both for the current performance of the business but for long term. And we feel like we're taking the right actions and in really good position to succeed both during the pandemic and beyond. So thanks for joining us today, and hope you all stay safe.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger’s second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 press release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning’s call will focus on adjusted results for the second quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings press release. Now I’ll turn it over to D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. To say that this quarter was different and challenging would be an understatement. I am very proud of how our leadership and team members have stepped up to the challenge. Whether dealing with the pandemic or with social injustice issues, our team has been fantastic throughout this uncertain time. Let me start off by providing you with an update on our pandemic response and a brief overview of the quarter before turning it over to Tom to dive into the details. So starting with an update on the pandemic, the Grainger team continues to work tirelessly to keep the world working during this challenging time. As I outlined on our first quarter call, Grainger is an essential business, and our customers count on us to keep their businesses up and running. Our pandemic response is wrapped in three broad priorities: First, serve our customers well through this challenging time; second, support the needs and safety of our team members; and third, ensure we remain in a strong financial position. I’ll provide a quick update on each point. First, our businesses remained open every day to serve our customers. I visited one of our DCs last week, and we have implemented several measures to protect the safety of team members and to ensure the continuity of our operations. We also recently reopened our branch showrooms to add to the curbside pickup service we have been operating throughout the pandemic. Our KeepStock team members continue to serve the vast majority of our customers. The exception would be some disruptive businesses where we’ve had to flip to alternate solutions. Throughout, our team is focused on customer and team member safety, including new protocols, temperature checks, space covering mandates and social distancing guidelines. This has certainly made operating more difficult, but we believe we have done very well with these changes. On the customer front, business reopenings and related activity continue to vary greatly based on industry and geography. Sales to health care, government and other essential businesses remained strong throughout the quarter. Sales to non-essential and disruptive businesses bottomed in April, and they’ve rebounded in May and again in June, although they still remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. I’ll talk about the pattern of revenue in a minute. Our supply chain has operated well throughout the pandemic although we have seen some lumpiness as we work to match supply with tremendous demand for some pandemic-related items. For most product categories, things have improved. But for some categories, global shortages will make supply a challenge throughout the balance of the year. Our team is working tirelessly to ensure supply for customers as the pandemic ebbs and flows. As we mentioned before, supporting the needs of our team members is a critical importance, especially during this period of uncertainty. Our team members are essential to serving our customers, and team member health and safety remains a priority. We have been fortunate to have absorbed the pandemic without major layoffs and currently have less than 3% of our workforce still on furlough. We have more team members who will return to work in the next few weeks. Having an experienced cohesive team will help us accelerate growth through the recovery. In addition, we remain vigilant around safety. Our team members give us great marks for making safety a priority as they support our customers. Finally, we have maintained a tight focus on our financial position throughout this period. On our Q1 call, I discussed our priority to preserve cash, including deferring action on certain capital projects, pausing our share repurchase program and drawing on our revolving credit facility. We continue to focus on cash preservation and have reduced non-essential SG&A spend by over $75 million sequentially in the quarter. That more than exceeds our $40 million to $55 million target set on the previous call. These actions helped us to finish the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity. Since the business performed well in the quarter, we have begun to evaluate repaying part of the revolver and are assessing a potential dividend increase. Depending on the shape of the pandemic, we will see some sequential cost increases related to things like advertising, some travel and the reinstitution of merit increases. But we remain committed to managing expenses very closely given the uncertain path ahead. To be clear, we are managing costs well, but also investing for the future success of the business. We continue focusing balancing the long-term health of the company alongside our short-term operational needs. Turning to our quarterly results. The business remained resilient despite this unprecedented period. Our daily sales finished down 1.8% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, underpinned by heightened sales of pandemic-related items that nearly offset a mid-teen decline of non-pandemic-related sales. With the MRO market down 14% to 15% in the quarter, we gained a lot of share fueled by pandemic-related sales, selling to new customers and improving non-pandemic sales as the quarter progressed. Gross margins were pressured primarily due to pandemic impacts, which Tom will detail in a bit. A meaningful portion of this margin pressure is temporary in nature, what we don’t know is how long the pandemic will last. Despite great SG&A performance, we have taken action to keep team members and customers safe that have added some short-term costs. Obviously, we’re incurring expense to ensure we create safe work spaces and interact, but also doing things like expediting shipping and allocating product to lower-margin health care and government customers. To state the obvious, we have been focused on helping customers and communities as much as possible, which sometimes means we have added cost. We’ve produced $230 million of operating cash flow and $189 million of free cash flow. That’s a solid result in this environment. Balancing the short-term with progress in strategic initiatives has been key. We continue to make progress on our key priorities. We are on plan to remerchandise an incremental $1.6 billion of our assortment this year. To support further acceleration of these activities, we plan to launch our new product information management system over the next month. We have made great strides in analytics and marketing capabilities, including upgrading internal talent to own more of the marketing activities. Our new customer information tools have enabled us to better match marketing and sales activities with new customers. We launched a new visual search application that is based on machine learning. We are getting great reviews on this solution. We are seeing continued traction with our KeepStock and other embedded customer solutions. We know that customers who have at least one embedded solution, including KeepStock and EDI Pro account for roughly 60% of our revenue. So this is an important customer segment. Here, we have upgraded our systems and processes to accelerate new installations and improve service on existing solutions. With our endless assortment model, MonotaRO continued to invest in technology and capacity to fuel their growth, while we have started to see the benefits of last year’s investments at Zoro in the U.S. And lastly, we further refined our international high-touch footprint with the completed divestiture of Fabory, and we announced an agreement to divest Grainger China. This helps us simplify our footprint and focus our efforts on our core markets. Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important this quarter to show the underlying trends with pandemic and non-pandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Over the last several weeks, I’ve been participating in virtual market visits with customers that were originally scheduled to be in person. I have talked with dozens of customers in several different industries to get a sense for how things are progressing. It’s important to note that even for customers with strong revenue performance, there has been a disruption in normal activities. For example, our hospital system has been heroic in dealing with the pandemic and saving lives, and their pandemic product demand has been enormous. But many of their normal facilities maintenance projects have been put on hold through this time to focus on COVID, which means that even hospitals had lower non-pandemic sales through the last four months. There’s a backlog of work that will need to be done in the future. But for now, customers in all industries are focusing on keeping people safe and recovery. In the U.S., we started to see increased pandemic sales in February, and they really picked up in March, where we quickly moved in-stock inventory. This trend continued with pandemic-related sales up around 70% in the second quarter. And while the environment remains fluid, this has continued at an accelerated rate into July. The heightened demand came from a multitude of customers across numerous industries with most of the pandemic products going to health care, government and essential businesses. Through most of March, non-pandemic sales were pretty stable. With the stay-at-home orders, we saw non-pandemic sales fall off significantly in late March, but they have gotten better each month since modeled out in April. We’ve seen further improvement in July. The good news is that we have seen a steady improvement in non-pandemic revenue across all customer types. It’s still below pre-pandemic levels, but it has improved. While we don’t know how this will progress, we do feel good about our ability to help customers weather the storm regardless of how the pandemic evolves. So with that, I will turn it over to Tom to take us through the quarter’s results in detail. Tom?
Tom Okray: Thanks, D.G. Starting with our total company results. As noted on Slide 8, daily sales were down 1.8% on a constant-currency basis. This decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, reflecting lower sales of non-pandemic products as well as significant headwinds from unfavorable product mix due to heightened sales of pandemic-related products. It should be noted that our endless assortment business grew approximately 16% in the quarter, showing tremendous resiliency despite the challenging market conditions. Combined, the U.S. segment and endless assortment business representing the majority of our revenue grew daily sales about 1% in the quarter and roughly 4% year-to-date. Gross margin for the total company was down 290 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. This decline continues to be driven mostly by pandemic-related impacts, particularly noticeable in our U.S. segment, as well as continued business unit mix impact as we experienced faster growth in our lower-margin endless assortment business. We gained 100 basis points of SG&A leverage with a total year-over-year cost decrease of $43 million. This leverage stemmed from prudent cost reductions across all business units, partially offset by increased pandemic-related costs to keep our people and facilities safe. Sequentially, total SG&A spend decreased over $75 million, exceeding our previously communicated goal of $40 million to $55 million, a great result as we were able to deliver better-than-expected savings in many areas of the business. We generated operating cash flow of $232 million, which we used to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and maintain a robust financial position. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $86 million to shareholders, had total capital expenditures of $43 million and significantly invested in inventory to ensure we can satisfy our customers’ needs going forward. Operating cash flow was 114% of net adjusted earnings and return on invested capital was over 28% year-to-date. As expected, our liquidity has remained strong, and we are evaluating increasing our dividend and beginning to repay our revolver draw. I would note, our calculated decremental margins are a bit skewed given the modest level of sales decline. While the decremental margin calculation is useful, it has limitations with relatively small sales declines. For example, if our sales would have declined 10% in the quarter with the same gross margin and SG&A spending, our business results would, in fact, be worse, but our decremental margins would have improved from down 111% to down 50%. Overall, U.S. segment daily sales decreased 2.4% in the quarter as compared to a decline of an estimated 14% to 15% for the broader MRO market. The decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, including unfavorable product mix from heightened levels of pandemic-related sales as well as decreased volume of non-pandemic products. In the U.S. segment, we estimate that pandemic-related product sales were up over 70% in the quarter, peaking in May but elevated throughout the quarter. Non-pandemic products were down in the mid-teens but saw sequential improvements from April lows. Gross margin was 310 basis points unfavorable to the prior year. The variance was driven primarily by three factors: pandemic-related headwinds, tariff fuel cost inflation and the impact of our rescheduled national sales meeting. First, while difficult to pinpoint, we estimate that pandemic-related headwinds accounted for approximately 60% of the gross margin decline in the quarter. These headwinds are multifaceted and include product mix impacts as well as we continued to sell significantly increased levels of lower-margin safety and cleaning products skewed more toward larger health care and government customers. Additionally, as we work to support our customers during this challenging time, we saw further margin pressure as we sourced high-demand products from non-traditional suppliers. This included increased freight and handling costs to ensure expedient delivery of these much-needed and critical supplies. These dramatic but temporary pandemic-related impacts are not expected to continue once we return to more normal course operation. The remaining gross margin decline was primarily driven by the lapping of year-over-year cost inflation, which was largely driven by tariffs that went into effect in 2019 Finally, our national sales meeting represents a roughly 30-basis-point headwind related to the reformatting and retiming of the meeting. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 60 basis points of leverage with costs decreasing approximately $25 million year-over-year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower travel expenses as well as reductions in marketing, labor-related costs, professional services and general frugality. These decreases more than offset temporary pandemic pay increases for hourly branch and DC team members, and enhanced safety measures in our facilities. Operating margin remained strong at 14.7%, but declined 250 basis points in the quarter on lower gross profit margins that were only slightly offset by the achieved SG&A leverage. Return on invested capital was a very healthy 38%. Looking at the U.S. MRO market, while extremely difficult to predict in this environment, we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 14% and 15% in the second quarter. Ranger was able to capture roughly 1,200 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, a 70% increase compared to the first quarter share increase. It should be noted that despite the pandemic, year-to-date daily sales are up 1.6%, and we have gained over 900 basis points of share. Moving on to the other businesses. Daily sales in our other businesses increased 2.7% or 2.5% on a constant-currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at – grew combined at 16% year-over-year, driven by strong customer acquisition at MonotaRO and low single-digit growth at Zoro. MonotaRO continues to perform at an impressive rate despite the Japanese recession and amidst the pandemic backdrop. Sales at Zoro accelerated throughout the quarter, with June up near 10% and July growing at an even faster rate. The international high-touch businesses have been severely impacted by pandemic-related shutdowns, with each geography experiencing meaningful year-over-year declines. Gross profit margin declined 140 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by declining margins at Fabory and MonotaRO. MonotaRO’s result is driven in part by freight increases from the acquisition of new B2C customers. We achieved significant SG&A leverage in the second quarter, resulting in operating margin expansion of 65 basis points. The SG&A favorability stems largely from decreased expenses across our international high-touch businesses, most notably at Cromwell, and expanded leverage in endless assortment. It is notable that despite some gross margin headwinds at MonotaRO, the endless assortment business grew operating margin in the second quarter. It is encouraging to see the 2019 investments in Zoro paying off. Further, despite significant top line challenges in 2020, Cromwell has meaningfully reduced its operating loss year-to-date. On June 30, we completed the sale of the Fabory business, the full operating results of this business are included in our second quarter results. Given the immateriality of the business, we will not be recasting our prior-year financials to reflect this transaction. So we will face revenue headwinds, but we’ll have a modest tailwind to operating margin rate comparisons over the next four quarters. Starting in the third quarter, we will provide organic daily revenue comparisons to strip out the top line impact of the divestiture. Turning to Slide 12. In Canada, daily sales decreased 21.7% or 19% in constant currency. The decline is comprised of roughly 17.5% in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately 1.5%. Volumes at the Grainger Canada business continued to be impacted by the economic slowdown and lower oil prices stemming from the pandemic. Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 145 basis points year-over-year, driven by the combination of aggressive pricing actions aimed at reinvigorating our customer base, pandemic-related mix impacts and lower vendor rebates. These impacts were partially offset by lower freight costs. Our cost management actions drove SG&A savings of $12 million year-over-year, resulting in 60 basis points of leverage. Operating margin was unfavorable 85 basis points versus prior year. Before I turn it back to D.G., given the unpredictability of the virus, it remains nearly impossible to predict how customers – how our customers will be impacted, but wanted to give you a sense for how July is unfolding and what it might mean for the third quarter. From a sales perspective, trends in early July are showing sales up mid-single digits on an organic total company basis, which strips out sales from our Fabory business. July-to-date trends show continued momentum with non-pandemic sales gaining steam from April lows and with pandemic-related sales remaining at elevated levels. Further, every business unit is showing improved performance in July when compared to June results. The situation clearly remains volatile. And as we saw in Q1, these month-to-date metrics may not be good predictors of our full quarter results. As we move into the second half of 2020, we anticipate gross margins will remain depressed as we expect pandemic-related impacts will continue. While we don’t know how the situation will evolve as the year goes on, given what we know now, we anticipate improvement from the 290 basis point year-over-year headwind we saw in Q2, but to what extent will be largely dependent on the pandemic-related actions of our customers. With respect to SG&A, as business unit activity ramps up, we expect to see some natural increases in spend related to marketing and travel, and we also reinstituted our annual merit increase, which was pushed from April to July. With this, we anticipate total company SG&A cost to range from $715 million to $730 million in the third quarter. Importantly, we remain focused on long-term growth, and we’ll continue to invest in people, process and technology to ensure we remain the industry leader. With that, I’ll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. Before we wrap up the call and go to questions, I want to touch on an important topic. The recent events of hatred and racism stand as reminders of the injustice in our world, and particularly for the African-American community. At Grainger, one of our core principles is to do the right thing. The right thing here seems fundamental: respect each other, embrace our differences and stand out for what is right. Remaining silent is not an option. Collectively, we need to be better. As a company, we know that diversity, inclusion and acceptance of our differences makes us stronger. This is central to our Grainger Edge principles and vital to our commitment to keep the world working. We have been encouraging our team members to have real conversations with each other about their background and identity, including the tough topics of race, gender, age and sexual orientation so that we can better know and understand each other. We know these conversations alone are not sufficient to solving the problem, and we need to collectively take action to ensure that economic opportunities are more plentiful for all. While we have work to do, we are committed to improving our talent and recruiting processes to root out bias, and we’re committed to promoting diverse hiring opportunities. This includes giving clear metrics and visibility, ensuring equitable pay and helping team members address unconscious bias. We’ll also continue to direct an arm of our charitable efforts to promote the educational advancement of those without privilege or access. I want to thank our team and our customers for performing so well through the pandemic. We are pleased with how we performed, and we remain committed to gaining share profitably and delivering strong results moving forward. Now with that, I’ll open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David Manthey: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First off, thanks for Slide 6. That’s very helpful to give us a picture of what’s going on under the surface here. But my question is, could you give us an update on your efforts in high touch? What initiatives are you driving on most right now to accelerate growth in that core business?
D.G. Macpherson: Sure. Thanks, David. I think they are the same things we’ve talked about in terms of being critical, and they really fall into two groups. One is improving our offer, our product assortment, our product information, our customer information. So we’re rolling out a new product information management system. We are remerchandising a bunch of the assortment to make the experience better for our customers. We continue to invest in digital technology for our website. So that’s kind of the first set of things we’re doing. We’ve also increased our marketing effectiveness and reimproved our digital marketing, which is both – which really hits all customers within the Grainger model, the high-touch model, and that has been very effective. And we’ve reinvigorated our KeepStock and on-site solutions for customers. We have a good traction going into the fourth quarter of last year and the beginning of this year. Some of that’s slowed down, but we still have new installs. We still have changed some installs for customers to help serve them during this time. And really we think that almost every large complex customer has either a digital solution that works for them or we help to manage inventory. And so we’re pushing on those basics of on-site service to make sure we do that right. And all that is leading to a strong share gain within the U.S. business.
David Manthey: Okay. Thanks for that. And second, on the Zoro U.S. growth initiatives that you laid out last year, is it correct to think that the costs are behind you now and you’re in the harvesting stage? And obviously, great timing on those. As we look to the future, will those kind of investments be less chunky ahead? Or will you periodically step those spending initiatives up and then followed by a period of harvesting the benefits?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. We would expect that to be less chunky. And the reason is a lot of the investments we made over the last 15 months or so, mostly in 2019, were really about a fairly significant strategic change to expand the assortment in the millions of products. We passed the 4.4 million products available to customers online Mazuro recently, and we’ve got a great pipeline. That required us to do it very, very differently than we’ve done historically. And so those investments are behind us. And I would expect them to be less chunky. We have – for the next three to five years, we will continue to expand margins with that business as we grow, given where we positioned ourselves right now.
David Manthey: That’s great, D.G. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Merkel: Hey, good morning, everyone.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Ryan Merkel: So first off, pandemic growth is holding up fairly well in July, as you cited. I realize this is hard to answer, but what is your outlook for pandemic sales going forward? Is there any visibility there?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, so it’s a great question, Ryan. Yes, there is – I mean, well, visibility in the traditional sense, I’m not sure. But certainly, if you look at our customer base, there are customers now who have planned, particularly PPE, into their process like they’ve never done it before. So you talk with customers. One customer told me they used to use 700 per day of a PPE item. Now they’re going to use 40,000 per day, as an example. So given the awareness of the virus, we would expect elevated levels of pandemic product for the foreseeable future. Will it be as much as we’ve had? Probably not, although as we see cases rise, my guess is there will be pretty significant elevated levels of pandemic product moving forward. But I do think this has forced people to change the way they think about personal protection and think about some of these products and keeping team members safe. So we expect to see elevated product levels for at least the next 1.5 years and probably beyond.
Ryan Merkel: Okay. It’s helpful. And then second question on non-pandemic sales. So I guess two-part question. Were the share gains there as strong? It looks like maybe not. Maybe clarify that. And then how did margins perform in non-pandemic sales year-over-year? Any surprises there?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. First, and I can turn it over to Tom. Margins were not surprising for us there, and they performed, clearly, better than the pandemic sales, because a lot of the pandemic sales are very large orders to large contract customers. So the margins were certainly better with non-pandemic. I would say that it’s challenging. Our market assumption of down 14, 15 in the U.S. would assume that non-pandemic sales were down quite a bit more than that. And so we do believe we gain significant share in non-pandemic product as well. Getting that level of detail, looking at that – our model is almost impossible to do. And so I would say, don’t really know. We think we gained share throughout all product categories. Whether we gained more or less share with non-pandemic is really, really hard to do. My guess is it’s less, but still very strong.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, perfect. Thanks. Pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.
John Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just as a thought. Your concern for social issues is laudable. You guys might want to even think of expanding your presence in the Chicago area, maybe even the south side of Chicago. Just as a thought.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, yes.
John Inch: No, it’s [indiscernible] like, why not? Consider it. So my question is, D.G., on Canada. Canada’s results have been pretty bad for a while. But in some respect, they’re down 19% or whatever core. They held up the profits pretty well. How did they do that exactly? Like, why was there not more decremental drag? Is that just because it’s been bad for so long that it’s been able to sort of move and adjust the costs? And would you expect that kind of performance going forward in terms of Canada’s cost preservation?
D.G. Macpherson: The answer is, yes, we expect it going forward. I think the thing that’s probably not easy to understand is – I spent some time with our customers recently in Canada, and our services improved dramatically there over the last couple of years. And coming off of the SAP installation and some other things, we had real challenging period there with service. And so I think a lot of this is just customers coming to realize that we’re providing strong service, building better relationships, and we’ve taken the cost actions we have. So we feel like that business is poised to do much, much better. Obviously, they’re going to be faced with some market challenges, but we feel like they’re positioned to do better. And we’ve taken a lot of cost out, but we also continue to invest in pockets for growth. And we feel like from a share perspective, we can gain share and gain share profitably given our current position.
John Inch: Well, I was going to ask you about Canada strategically. It has been – I appreciate the investment posture. Like, is there a way to maybe even step that up over time? I guess the question is, so at some point after what’s been like three years or whatever, pretty tough results there, I’m assuming, number one, you’re not able to actually sell the business. Because I think years ago, you guys implemented initiatives to integrate it more with the U.S., so selling it would actually be challenging. You’d have to untangle it. So if you can’t really do that, is the plan to just get it profitable over time to a certain threshold and it sort of sits as a cash cow? Or you really think it can sort of do what some of the – some of what you’ve been able to accomplish in the U.S. in terms of share gains, can it do that in Canada, perhaps by shifting away from oil and gas more to other pockets of their economy or whatever?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, we believe we can do that. And actually, we’re starting to see that. So with government, health care, manufacturing, we’re starting to get some traction there. And as that happens, we believe it can be a growth engine. We’re obviously going to be very, very focused on profitability. But we do think there’s going to be nice growth coming out, particularly the eastern part of Canada, and we’ve already started to see some of that underneath the numbers. And so we feel like – and you’re right, it is running – we’re running it more like the U.S., and that’s helped our cost position. But the team up there is very focused on profitable growth. I think we’ve got a really strong leadership team up there and the sales organization now, and we’re pretty excited about the path and the ability to grow consistently and grow profitably.
John Inch: So it sounds like 2021 could actually be a significant inflection year, without putting words in your mouth. Is that reasonable as a thought process?
D.G. Macpherson: It’s a reasonable assumption. I think pandemic aside, how it evolves. But yes, we feel like – we felt like this year was going to be significant improvement. We started to see that in the first couple of months and then, of course, the world stopped. So we feel like we’re well positioned when things do come back for it to be an inflection.
John Inch: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to stick with Canada for a second. And I think I saw aggressive pricing there. Wondering what enabled that. Was that kind of catch-up on – now that service levels are more enabling? Or is there lack of elasticity?
D.G. Macpherson: No. Most of that is what we saw in the U.S. with pandemic. So large sales of pandemic items to government customers, some health care customers. That is – the majority of the aggressive pricing would have been to serve the pandemic.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And on the share gain, I think Tom mentioned 900 basis points. Just curious, again, another crack at trying to filter that with the pandemic demand. It doesn’t seem like it’d be a sticky type of share gain that you have, the way you normally accrue shares. So wondering about how you’re viewing retention of that.
D.G. Macpherson: Well , the way I’m viewing it personally is, we – the world is a little unusual right now, right? So to say that you gained 1,200 basis points when you were down 2%, it seems like a strange thing to say. We think it’s accurate analytically, but it’s a little messy, right? Because we – it’s hard to tell what’s going on underneath that. We feel like we are gaining share. We feel like we’re doing the right things. And we feel like our normal share gains, we’ll be able to retain. There may be some of that that’s hard to retain, of course, depending on sort of pandemic sales. But certainly, we feel good about it, but we don’t – we’re not taking it literally, if that’s your question.
Christopher Glynn: Yes. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Uhlman: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a follow-up on that question. In the past, you used to talk about the medium-sized customer recovery from lapsed customers or folks who used to do business with. Could you remind us of what your headroom is of gaining share with those folks?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we saw an interesting dynamic with midsized customers during the quarter that has since reversed. And so let me talk about that for just a second. So with large customers, we ended up prioritizing a lot of pandemic efforts for large customers, hospitals and government customers, in particular, and essential manufacturing businesses and others distribution businesses. As a result of that, we held pandemic product from the website, in some cases, and you’re seeing all the competitors do that. And we did see the midsized customers get hit harder during the initial shelter-in-place orders. What we’ve seen though is they’ve actually come back stronger. And so we’re seeing very strong growth with midsized customers in the last six weeks, which is encouraging. We’ve acquired more new customers than we really ever had during this period because we’ve had product and many others haven’t. And so we think we’ve got a very strong – a lot of headroom with midsized customers, we were, at one point, $1.8 billion, and we think we can get back to there and beyond over time. So we think we’ve got a long way to grow to have outgrowth with midsized customers. And the pandemic has been a strange period for everything, but we’re now starting to see that growth come back in again.
Adam Uhlman: Okay, got you. Thanks. And then how should we think about inventories, specifically for the rest of the year? And maybe just some thoughts on working capital for the second half, would be great. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: So I’ll turn it over to Tom here in just a second. I would say we have made significant inventory investments to be able to get continuity of supply for our customers. So more than we obviously typically would, given some of the supply challenges that existed in the world, and that has been a working capital build. We would expect that build to stay throughout the remainder of this year and into next year before it starts to bleed off, but I’ll turn it over to Tom.
Tom Okray: Yes. Thanks, D.G. Yes, what was part of our operating cash flow bridge was a significant investment into working capital and, specifically, inventory. When it became clear, coming through the first quarter and into the second quarter, that we were in a cash generation position, then we felt it was right to invest in working capital, use our strong balance sheet so that we would be able to take care of the needs of our customers. So we have done prebuys. We’ve done prepayments. And we think we’re well-suited to take care of the needs going forward to help out those key customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Nigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Just going back to the pandemic. Actually, no, let me skip that. Let’s go to single channel. I mean, the growth at Zoro was actually pretty impressive. As was – I’m not sure, but we get the daily sales monthly from their website. I mean, I think the factors are pretty clear. But is there any way to think about the SKU expansion year-over-year? And how much of that is contributing to the growth versus just demand? And I’m curious, given the nature of the shutdowns and the pandemic, is there any cannibalization happening between single channel endless assortment and your traditional business during this period of time?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So great question. So I think I mentioned, we have a very strong pipeline, millions of products in the pipeline to add to Zoro. If you look over the last three or four years, you look at curves of new product adds and their productivity, remains a big part of the growth of Zoro. And in, let’s call it, normal times, we would expect product adds over the next three to five years to be as much as half of the growth of the business. And so that’s obviously an important growth driver. We have not seen any further cannibalization during this period than we’ve seen at other times between Zoro and Grainger. In fact, Zoro’s growth has been – a lot of it’s been very, very focused on very small customers during this time and getting them product they can’t get elsewhere. So we’re pretty excited about the pattern. I will say that both MonotaRO and Zoro have had higher acquisition than normal, and some of that acquisition has been consumers. We don’t remarket to consumers. They do find as some – as people have been trying to find pandemic-related or really any product during this time. But the business acquisition has been stronger than normal, too, and that’s really the important number to look at. So that’s strong business acquisition, driven in part by product adds.
Nigel Coe: Great. Thanks, D.G. And then, obviously, the way you’ve broken out, say, the mix and the price/mix this quarter, I think, is really helpful. The 30 bps of headwind from price and customer mix, would you be prepared to talk about price in isolation? How is pricing tracking right now? And how do you feel customer pricing is in terms of the go-forward? Are customers receptive of inflation right now? Or any change on pricing power?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. We haven’t really seen any change in pricing power. Our pricing – and Tom, I’ll let you answer this. I will say our pricing, in normal years, we see GP trail off as the year goes along. This year is going to be not as much of that as we do see price get better, and we’ve seen it get better through the second quarter. And so we feel like we’re going to get more price going forward. But Tom, do you want to answer?
Tom Okray: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Nigel, and I read your note before the call. And I think it’s important to note that we really haven’t done anything new in terms of calculation. We’ve just broken out product mix with volume. Product mix had always been in volume. But just historically, it hadn’t been so relevant. It was fairly static. Obviously, with the pandemic, it’s a much, much bigger story, so that’s why we broke it out. And as it relates to our revenue bridge, it represents over 90% of the variance. The remainder, as you note, is some customer mix and price. And as D.G. said, we’ve seen strengthening over the quarter, and we expect that into the future in terms of price inflation, albeit we’ve seen a little bit of softness as it compares to prior year.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, D.G.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Dankert: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just to carry that a bit further. Tom, in the past, you’ve mentioned that some introductory pricing was certainly an onboarding engine for large customer acquisition. I guess, is that still a part of the strategy? You highlighted some of the other pieces there, but should we still expect prices, from a strategic standpoint, to be a bit lower in that large customer piece of the business going forward?
Tom Okray: Yes. I would say that’s probably paused a little bit with the pandemic, just with the focus with the PPE, but it’s certainly still part of the acquisition strategy. And maybe since you brought up gross margin related, let me try to unpack it even a little bit further than we did in the prepared remarks. As we’re not giving guidance, want to be as helpful as we can to everybody putting their models together. So as we’ve said in the prepared remarks, we’ve got 60%, which is COVID-related. So on 310 bps, that’s roughly 180 bps unfavorable versus prior year. You’ve got NSSM, it’s 30 bps. So there, it’s 210 in total. And the remainder is cost/other and as D.G. mentioned, historically, going from Q2 to Q3, we would see a meaningful decline in terms of gross margin rate. This year, going – as it relates to Q3, we expect that to be mitigated somewhat for the following reasons. NSSM will no longer be a headwind, so we will gain that back. We also see the tariff cadence improving. So tariff-related cost inflation will improve a little bit. And then we see price inflation strengthening as well, and we expect that to continue into Q3. Now the big wildcard, of course, is the pandemic impact as it relates to gross margin. So that is really the wildcard in terms of what the actual gross margin rate will be for Q3. What we do expect, though, as we compare the gross margin rate to the prior year, we don’t expect to be down 310 bps in the U.S. segment and 290 bps overall. We do expect improvement from that. So just wanted to give you that color to help you all with your modeling. Thanks.
Chris Dankert: No, that’s extremely helpful. Thank you for the clarity there. And then just to follow-up. I guess, we’ve seen China and Fabory go away here. I guess, just any quick thoughts on Cromwell. How it’s executing? Does it still make sense in the portfolio? Just your high-level thoughts would be great.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. I guess, I’ll give some thoughts. So Cromwell is – it is a business that is very much in our high-touch solutions model. It looks a lot like Grainger. They have executed, I think, while the last year, to put themselves in a position where they can grow and improve profitability dramatically. So the pandemic doesn’t change our thoughts on the business. We’ve talked about sort of making sure we have a fast recovery of that business. We should be able to get very clear signs on the pace of that recovery coming out of this. So I’d say, happy with the team, happy with what they’re doing. Service is really, really good there now and starting to win back some business, and they’re starting to improve profitability, they’ve improved their cost position. I want to give that a chance to run out a little bit more. Obviously, the pandemic may slow that a little bit. But certainly, we still have high expectations for how they can turn it around there.
Chris Dankert: Understood. Thank you so much, guys and better luck on forward here.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Tom Okray: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Tom Okray: Hi, Deane.
Deane Dray: Maybe a couple of questions on capital allocation. When do you think you might be resuming buybacks? And then any other color on a potential dividend increase, either the timing, magnitude? Are you tying it to a payout ratio? This is – D.G., as you said, these are not normal times, but how does that – how do you – how are you looking at the dividend increase?
Tom Okray: We’d expect that dividend increase would be similar to what it has been in prior years, Deane. With respect to timing, we’ve been talking about it. And if something happens, it would probably happen in the third quarter. With respect to repurchasing shares, right now, with the spike and are we going to have a shutdown to with an abundance of caution, we really haven’t resumed the buybacks, even though we are obviously generating robust cash flow. That, we would probably start to think a little bit harder at the end of Q3. And if we were going to do something, it would likely be in Q4, I would think.
Deane Dray: That’s helpful. And considering the divestitures of Fabory and Grainger China, are you contemplating any other portfolio moves over the near term? Any divestitures?
D.G. Macpherson: Not at this point, we are not.
Deane Dray: Good. And then just last one from me. Could you expand on, in the context of having to source some high demand products from – I think you described them as nonstandard suppliers. What the challenges are. I think you touched on freight, but did you have to qualify the suppliers? And how do you think this issue, this headwind abates?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So it’s been a very unusual time for supply. I think the things that we’ve been really focused on are making sure we can get supply of high-quality products. So we do have to qualify suppliers. We have to decide whether or not the product meets our quality standards and actually does what it says it’s going to do. And then we have to, in some cases, as Tom mentioned, yet you have to pay some upfront money, which typically would not happen, and we’ve done that in a number of cases. So it’s a – and as this thing unfolded, it was a little bit like the Wild West in the sense that everybody claimed they had a solution, and oftentimes those solutions weren’t real. And so we’ve had to work with our team in China and to work with our team in the U.S. to really understand the quality, the availability, the integrity of the supply, and that’s been really important. I think we’ve done a nice job navigating that. But I expect that to weigh now in some categories that may remain. But generally, it’s gotten a little bit easier lately.
Deane Dray: That’s good to hear. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning and thank you. D.G., you touched on the top line growth for Zoro and MonotaRO. I was hoping maybe you could just touch on how to think about profitability of Zoro versus MonotaRO. Are there any structural differences, whereby Zoro shouldn’t look like MonotaRO longer term? Just any thoughts there.
D.G. Macpherson: We have looked at that. And as you know, Masaya Suzuki is running that business at this point, the Zoro business, and he’s been the CEO of – and still is the CEO of MonotaRO. The differences, if they exist, are relatively minor. We think that the Zoro business should be able to get to certainly high single-digit operating margins, which is very profitable from return on invested capital. And we’ve got our plans to go ahead and make that happen over the next several years. And so we feel really good about the profitability path of Zoro.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And just a follow-up question, I’ll turn it over. Tom, you gave some incremental color on gross margin. So it’s more of a clarification question. If pandemic sales continue sort of at the same pace as July, is Q3 gross margin just down sequentially, assuming pandemic sales kind of continue at the pace they are?
Tom Okray: Well, just to reiterate, Hamzah, there’s going to be some tailwinds, for sure, and that’s the NSSM meeting, that’s the cost tariffs and that’s the strengthening pricing. We would also expect, as D.G. said, some of the money we paid to, let’s say, air freight supply, we would expect that to likely go down as well. The bottom line is it’s just so hard to predict something that’s never happened before in terms of the pandemic. So I’ll just reiterate. Historically, Q3 gross margin is less than Q2. Would not expect it to be that dramatic of a falloff in – as it has been historically. So I’ll leave it at that. But we do expect that it will be significantly, from a bps perspective compared to prior year, not as down as 310 or 290 for the overall company.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. Thank you so much.
Tom Okray: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Michael McGinn: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for sneaking me in here. If I could go to the U.S. segment, just thinking a little outside the box. Can you kind of frame for us what the opening of branches means from a sequential sales uptick if we were thinking of that as like a noncore add back, what that means in terms of sales and maybe margin mix?
D.G. Macpherson: So you’re talking about opening our showrooms where we were only doing curbside for a while?
Michael McGinn: Correct.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So I would say that just rough math, walk-in traffic is about 10% of our volume or revenue, at least at this point. And what we see is we see a modest increase when we open the showrooms. It is – it should help margins because, typically, the profile of those customers are not generally contract customers, and it’s usually higher-margin sales. So it will be modest for the overall growth profile, but it will help. And we’ve seen that already happen as we’ve opened those up.
Michael McGinn: Okay. And then second one for me. I think Nigel was mentioning the SKU count additions on Zoro. You have a fellow, I guess, B2C company out there with similar ambitions to rapidly increase SKU count. Can you give us a framework for how many resellers you have added and how much it would take to get to that $10 million, and whether you view that $10 million as a high hurdle, low bar? Any commentary there would be great.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. Given – I would say that given the – we’re talking about every quarter, adding tens of suppliers. So it’s not thousands of suppliers before, but it’s tens of suppliers. But we have a line of sight into getting to 6 million or 7million SKUs at this point, and we feel like getting to $10 million is not all that difficult to do given the new processes we have in place. I will say that the MonotaRO business in Japan is about 20 million, roughly 20 million items. So we’ve done this before. We understand the process. And I think the team has done a great job of configuring to be able to step on the accelerator, and we have a very nice pipeline at this point.
Michael McGinn: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Baumann: Hey, D.G. Hey, Tom. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Just a quick one on – so you talked a lot about gross margin expectations for third quarter. Just if you could provide any framework. Maybe I missed this earlier, but any framework around how to think about SG&A or incremental margins in the third quarter if sales continue to grow in that mid-single-digit range?
Tom Okray: Yes. I mean, related to SG&A, I’ll refer you back to the prepared remarks where we think, on a total company basis, SG&A will be between $715 million and $730 million. And that is a decrease, obviously, from prior year, but an increase from Q2 as the country starts to open up and we’re spending more on travel, we’re spending more on advertising. Those types of things. As it relates to decremental margin, if we were to see a volume decline from 5% to 10%, which is inconsistent with what we’ve seen so far, July to date, we would expect decremental margins to be in the 35% to 45% range, consistent with what we said last quarter. Obviously, if we continue at a mid-single-digit growth, then we would flip from decremental margins to incremental margins. And there, I think, depending on, again, and I have to keep – I apologize, I have to keep giving the qualifier of what the pandemic looks like. But depending on how the gross margin behaves, we could be around 20% plus/minus gross margins as long as the pandemic does not take a really harder hit on gross margin.
Patrick Baumann: What – go ahead. Go ahead, D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: [Indiscernible] to Tom is we talked about adding travel costs back. That may sound a little odd in today’s world. What we really mean there is we are now able to visit most of our customers. So we’re talking about mileage reimbursement for our sales team, which will increase. It’s not a huge number, but that’s the type of cost add-back we would be having, is being able to engage with our customers, again, which we started to do.
Patrick Baumann: Yes. I assume – great clarification. I assume that $715 million to $730 million is embedding sales growth since you’re growing 5% to date? Or is the range there because you don’t know. How do I think about that?
D.G. Macpherson: I think our assumptions change frequently now as the world changes. But certainly, right now, we would envision – all we really know is through the first three weeks, we’re up about mid-single digits.
Tom Okray: And I’ll just reiterate, it is lower than prior year, which was in the $760 million range.
Patrick Baumann: Yes. And then last one for me. Did you mention the year-over-year benefit from tax in the second quarter to free cash flow? I might have missed that, too. Sorry about that.
Tom Okray: Can you repeat the question, please, Patrick?
Patrick Baumann: I thought I read in the slides or somewhere that there was a benefit from timing of tax payments and free cash flow in the second quarter.
Tom Okray: Yes, yes. Thank you. Yes, there was $115 million benefit deferral of federal income taxes, instead of paying our federal payments in April and June, like we did in the prior year, we pay them in July.
Patrick Baumann: Okay, thank you so much for clarifying.
Tom Okray: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Macpherson for any closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: Great. I’ll keep this very short. Thanks for joining us today. Certainly, I think we’d all agree that there’s probably more market uncertainty at any time in our careers. But hopefully, you see from our results that we think we’re prepared to perform through whatever comes. We’re excited to see some of the non-pandemic volume come back, and we’re excited by the trends. And we’re going to stay completely focused on our core business models and driving profitable share gain through our high-touch solutions model in North America and our analyst assortment business. So we’re proud of where we are, what we’ve accomplished, and we’re ready for the future. So thanks for joining us today, and I wish you all will stay safe.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, ma’am. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's first quarter 2020 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q1 press release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the first quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our press release. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with an overview of our actions and experiences in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an overview of the quarter. Then Tom will get into more specifics about our financial response to the pandemic, as well as detailed information on our Q1 results. Before we start, I want to thank our 25,000 team members across the globe, who continue to live our principles and are working hard to achieve our purpose to keep the world working. We are an essential business supporting hospitals, governments, first responders, food manufacturers, distribution companies and many others that are fighting this fight on the frontlines. These are incredibly stressful times for all. From our team members who are onsite with our customers helping them work through day-to-day challenges, to those ensuring orders are picked, packed and shipped properly, I am proud of the work we are doing to keep our team members, customers and communities safe. I am also thankful for our supplier and logistics partners’ efforts to help us provide much needed products to our customers in this desperate time of need. To make this come to life, I thought I would share a photo I received from one of our leaders at a branch located in Brooklyn, New York. This particular branch and its cross-borough partner in Maspeth, they are both situated in between a number of hospitals that are the epicenter of the pandemic fight. Each day, the teams at both locations dutifully come to work, hang the American flag and roll up their sleeves, and in their words, they do this to keep America running. It's this spirit that inspires me, makes me truly proud to lead this company and gives all of us hope in our ability to get through this crisis. Turning to Slide 5. Let me provide you with some color on the actions we have and continue to take in response to the pandemic. The biggest concern right now is our collective health and wellbeing. As a business, this is our absolute number one priority. When we look back on this crisis, it is how we will all be judged. With health as a primary focus, we have established three priorities during this challenge. First, we must continue to service our customers well. These are the customers that have so much to do with supporting the healthcare system and other critical industries in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Second, we must support team members by providing a safe environment and as much job continuity as possible. During this period, everyone is scared and we are trying to provide team members stability and safety. And third, we must ensure that we remain in a strong financial position in order to execute on our first two priorities and remain positioned to thrive when we move beyond this pandemic. We have and will continue to ground our decision-making process, with these three objectives in mind. Starting with the first, Grainger has been designated an essential business for all our locations around the globe, allowing us to continue to serve our customers and live out our purpose. In many cases, we are working side-by-side with hospitals, state and local governments and critical manufacturing businesses to ensure that they can keep doing their critical work. This has been a challenging period. The virus has created significant supply demand imbalances for PPE and other products, creating substantial challenges for our customers. We've had to make some tough choices about prioritization and the challenge will continue into the near future. But our team is working very hard to find solutions to help our customers. In some cases, this has meant being creative with product solutions in the short-term. We continue to be a valued partner to all our customers even as we prioritize the healthcare system. We started planning and responding to the pandemic in late January and established an emergency preparedness task force shortly thereafter. In the early days, our focus was on product supply. We executed large pre-buys of non-pandemic product, leveraging our extra capacity in Louisville to ensure we could supply our customers through this period. Our service levels of non-pandemic supplies continue to be strong. As it became clear that the pandemic would have a significant impact on all developed markets, we developed business continuity plans following guidance from the CDC, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the World Health Organization and federal and state governments. In many cases, we are going beyond that guidance, including temperature screening of all individuals prior to entering Grainger facilities. We have taken a number of preventative steps to protect our team members and customers, including minimizing exposure of affected team members to other team members and customers, augmenting the cleaning procedures at our facilities, introducing mandatory curbside service at all our branches, providing personal protective equipment for team members working onsite with customers, and mandating work-from-home for all our team members who are able, including our phone service and technical support agents. We were able to pivot quickly to work-from-home for team members who are able to do that and we have not missed a beat. In addition, we moved our National Sales Meeting to a virtual meeting after canceling the conference in Florida. We appreciate the flexibility our team members have demonstrated as we implement these solutions. Throughout this, I continue to receive many letters and calls of thanks from customers and I am inspired with how the Grainger team is taking care of our customers and each other during this challenging time. I have also received many calls from customers who need solutions that we and no one else can fulfill right now. Stress in the system is extremely high, as you might imagine. On the supply chain front, our world-class supply chain has remained resilient. As I mentioned, we have had minimal disruptions to date on non-pandemic related items. We continue to maintain high levels of inventory and are leveraging our strong relationships with our suppliers and transportation partners to secure products and ensure we meet our same-day ship complete delivery promise as regularly as possible. Like others around the globe, we continue to see shortages and stock-outs of critical pandemic-related items, including N95 masks, sanitizers and other PPE. We are working diligently with our suppliers, alongside our government and healthcare customers to secure as much product as possible, as well as trying to identify and source suitable alternatives. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the problem, in several weeks time, we received orders for the same quantity of safety masks that we usually receive over several years, and in some cases, even decades. This is truly an unprecedented challenge and getting America back to work is essential. Let me assure you that Grainger is holding true to our values. We will continue to work with customers and supplier partners to find the best solutions on all pandemic products, we are honoring our contracts and did not raise prices, unless necessary, to recover our increased costs. Moving to our second priority, we are committed to making decisions with team members' best interest in mind. Grainger is a sound business with a longstanding belief in the need to have a stable workforce to serve customers and keep the world working. When we emerge from the pandemic, we want to ensure that we are well positioned with an experienced team to accelerate growth through the recovery. While we don't yet know the full financial impact of COVID-19, we have contingency plans in place for any eventuality. In the short term, we have furloughed a small portion of our workforce and reduced hours for others. In both cases, with the enhanced CARES Act, we are focused on keeping our team members as close to hold as possible. Beyond this, we have delayed merit increases for salaried employees and have instituted short-term pay cuts for executives. Our incentive plans will adjust based on market conditions. Our goal is to keep our team members employed over the long haul, treated fairly and working during this time. Our third priority, which Tom will cover in detail is around maintaining our financial strength. In short, we are well positioned with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and a robust liquidity position. We are prepared for a multitude of scenarios and have already implemented changes focused on cash flow in the near-term. Our strong financial position should enable us to withstand even the most challenging economic and market environments, while allowing continued investment through the cycle. Stepping back, these three objectives do naturally create some tension. As you can imagine, given the size of our workforce, we have had cases of COVID-19 within our facilities. In each case, team members' safety is our top priority. That means we have had to shift volumes across our network as we temporarily closed buildings to deep clean the facility and quarantine any exposed team members. We are also paying DC branch and KeepStock team members a ship premium, recognizing their great work and commitment during this challenging time. As a result, we are running at higher unit cost than normal in our DCs and elsewhere to ensure we serve our customers to our high standards and help get America and the world back on its feet. Lastly, and before we move on, given the uncertainty around the depth and duration of this pandemic and the related economic response, we are suspending guidance for 2020. As you might imagine, we have customers that are completely closed. We have customers who are operating under reduced volumes. We have customers operating normally. And we have customers who are running 24/7. With all these moving pieces, it doesn't make sense to forecast in this environment. While we can't guarantee the future, we've weathered storms in our long history before and have already started planning for the recovery whenever it may come. This will require us all to think differently as we and our customers are changed by this pandemic. There is a lot to learn and I believe much opportunity ahead. As we move forward, we will continue to evaluate all actions to ensure we are meeting our priorities to serve our customers, support our team members and ensure we remain in a strong financial place. Turning to our quarterly results. We delivered strong topline growth in the quarter, while navigating through this period of uncertainty. We achieved daily sales growth of 5.7% underpinned by traction on our growth priorities and heightened sales of pandemic related items. In the U.S. segment, we outgrew the MRO market by approximately 700 basis points. Excluding estimated pandemic-related sales, which is inherently messy calculation, we were in line with our goal of 300 basis points to 400 basis points of outgrowth versus the market. So we had a strong topline outcome. Operating margins were pressured by factors including the timing of certain SG&A investments, pandemic-related mix impacts, business unit mix impacts as well as the timing of year-over-year pricing and cost actions. Tom will cover the details in a bit. We produced strong cash flow in the first quarter, including $244 million of operating cash flow and $194 million of free cash flow and finally, we continue to make progress on our 2020 priorities. Our remerchandising efforts continued in the quarter as we work to further improve product and search information. We continue to improve the efficacy of our marketing initiatives Our endless assortment business grew 17% underpinned by resilient performance at MonotaRO and SKU additions at Zoro. Masaya Suzuki our new leader of the endless assortment portfolio and his team are implementing the MonotaRO playbook across Zoro and are closely looking at a number of areas for improvement, most notably, around discounting strategy and other opportunities to improve profitability. Our turnaround efforts in both Canada and Cromwell performed in line with our expectations despite turbulent market conditions. And while we have curtailed non-essential spending in certain areas, we will continue to invest where it matters most. Most importantly, we continue to improve the user experience in our core businesses with customer feedback coming in extremely strong. As we look forward, we will focus on what we can control and make decisions based on facts. The business is well positioned to sustain through this pandemic and I am confident we will come out stronger on the other side. With that, I will turn it over to Tom.
Thomas Okray: Thanks, D.G. As D.G. mentioned, we have established three broad priorities that are serving as the backbone as we work through this unprecedented challenge. Our third decision-making tenet is to ensure we remain on a strong financial footing. In this regard, we have taken several actions to bolster an already strong financial position. From a balance sheet perspective, in the quarter, we increased the size of our revolver to $1.25 billion and executed a large scale refinancing. Combined, these initiatives increased our available liquidity by roughly $625 million and eliminated all material near-term maturities. At the end of March, we proactively tapped $1 billion of the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. As noted by our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow results, this was done solely out of an abundance of caution. In this low rate environment, it's an inexpensive insurance policy. Further, with the refinancing, we consolidated a majority of our foreign currency denominated debt, which pushed out any material maturities until 2025. Our revolver does not contain any financial covenants and we continue to have strong A category ratings from both S&P and Moody's. All in, we exited the quarter with over $1.7 billion in available liquidity, including $1.5 billion in cash and only a 1.2x net debt leverage ratio. When it became clear that we might be facing a serious economic downturn, we proactively began implementing initiatives that conserve cash and optimize profitability. To be clear, the initiative strike a balance between short-term cost and cash savings and ensuring we come out of the gates strong when the crisis ends. Example of these baseline initiatives, include temporarily furloughing team members to align with reduced volumes, short-term pay cuts for executives, delaying merit increases for our salaried workforce in North America, reducing outside professional service spend, scaling back advertising spend, eliminating non-essential travel and delaying hiring decisions. We expect these baseline initiatives and the lapping of certain Q1 items will create $40 million to $55 million of sequential cost savings in the second quarter of 2020 even one accounting for an increased level of cost to support our pandemic response. We have also identified several additional initiatives that can be implemented depending on volume levels. We are staying nimble and monitoring sales trends, cash position, and working capital closely. Additionally, we are deferring certain discretionary capital expenditures and now expect our full-year 2020 CapEx spend to be between $150 million and $175 million. This is down from our previous expectation of $250 million. With respect to working capital, we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to maintain our strong relationships, while ensuring a manageable cash conversion cycle. To date, we haven't seen a material change in delinquencies or bad debt. Further, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. However, to preserve financial flexibility, we have paused our share repurchase program. As for the dividend, we remain committed to the program and do not currently foresee where we would reduce or suspend its payment. We understand the importance of achieving our 49th consecutive year of dividend increases. While it's difficult in this environment to forecast the future, from a cash perspective, we have modeled multiple scenarios that reflect varying depth and duration cases of volume loss. Given what we are able to see now, we are confident that we will have adequate liquidity to support our business operations through this pandemic. We have a strong reputation of managing well through difficult times and we expect this crisis will be no different. Based on what we know today, we are confident that we will emerge from this pandemic as a trusted partner to our customers and suppliers and are well-suited for the recovery.  As we turn to our detailed quarterly results and think about the financial impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, it's very challenging to specifically quantify. There are numerous moving pieces, including sales of pandemic-related SKUs, determining substitute products, impact of customer capacity cuts or closures and identification of customer pre-buying. All of these combined makes it challenging to pinpoint the specific impact of the pandemic on our financials. Therefore, as I go through our financial results, I will share estimated directional commentary on the impact. As noted on Slide 9. For the total company, daily sales were up 5.5% in the quarter, 5.7% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by around 7% increase in volume offset by an approximately 2% headwind from price. Roughly half of the price headwind is due to product and customer mix with the other half related to lapping of the 2019 price increase. For the total company, we estimate the pandemic-related product sales represented roughly half of our sales growth. Additionally, for perspective, it should be noted, our core U.S. and endless assortment businesses combined grew at 7.3% on a daily basis during the quarter. Gross profit margin for the total company was down 180 basis points versus the prior year quarter. This decline is driven by customer and product mix headwinds and our U.S. segment largely related to sales of pandemic-related items as well as business unit mix from higher growth in our lower margin endless assortment business. Gross margin rates are much more stable when we are looking sequentially. We gained 20 basis points of SG&A leverage with cost up $47 million versus prior year as we continue to make investments to support our strategic priorities. As previously communicated, we generally expect SG&A spend to grow at approximately half the sales rate. For the quarter, our SG&A growth was higher than this annual target by approximately $20 million. This $20 million is driven by additional headcount that was added in the back half of 2019 incremental marketing investments, which will be reduced going forward and heightened spend to support our pandemic response efforts. Additionally, we were impacted by non-recurring and timing items, including an extra payroll day and one-time costs for certain legal matters. These impacts more than offset lower travel and variable compensation costs as well as favorable depreciation and amortization in the current year period. Excluding these non-recurring and unusual items, we were directionally in line with our plan from a cost perspective, which assumed elevated SG&A costs in the first quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $244 million, which we use to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we used $178 million on share repurchases and dividends and had total capital expenditures of $50 million. Even in our current difficult economic times, we continue to invest prudently in our business, all while maintaining a healthy 1.2x net debt leverage ratio. Operating cash flow was 106% of net adjusted earnings and return on invested capital was over 29%. Overall, U.S. segments daily sales grew 5.7% in the quarter or about 700 basis points faster than the broader MRO market. Sales growth in the quarter included approximately 8% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable price of around 2%. Roughly half of the price headwind is due to customer and product mix with the other half related to the lapping of 2019 price increase. In the U.S. segment, we estimate that pandemic-related product sales represented roughly half of our sales growth. Gross margin was 230 basis points unfavorable to the prior year. The variance was driven largely by two primary factors. About half is related to lapping of 2019 pricing and cost actions and the other half is related to unfavorable product and customer mix. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, we expected our Q1 2020 number to face difficult comparisons to the prior year period as we aggressively raised prices to combat expected tariff inflation increases in the first quarter of 2019. We acknowledged that we overshot the mark and rolled back prices throughout 2019. Additionally, tariff cost-related increases didn't actually take effect until later in 2019 and thus created a second half headwind in Q1 2020. Looking sequentially, we did see positive price inflation in this quarter compared to Q4 2019. Going forward, we expect this tough year-over-year comparison will lessen in the back half of 2020. The remaining portion of the year-over-year gross margin decline resulted from customer and product mix headwinds, which were exacerbated by sales of lower margin pandemic-related items to larger low margin customers. We expect these mix-related headwinds to continue during the pandemic as we sell increased levels of safety and cleaning products to our large healthcare, government and critical manufacturing customers. This FX will become even more pronounced in the second quarter as we expect the more dramatic mix impact that we saw in the March to continue through Q2. In the quarter, we also had unfavorable mix related to our multi-site customer growth strategy. As we discussed on the Q4 call, this impact will be temporary and will continue throughout fiscal year 2020. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 30 basis points of leverage with costs increasing $30 million in the quarter. This level of increase was caused by many of the factors I outlined earlier, including incremental headcount added in the second quarter of 2019 as well as marketing investments, cost to support our pandemic response and an extra payroll day. Operating margin was strong at 15%, but declined 200 basis points in the quarter on the declining gross profit margin, which was offset by slight increase in SG&A leverage experienced in the quarter. Turning specifically to the U.S. MRO market, while extremely difficult to project in this environment, we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 1% and 1.5% in the first quarter. Grainger was able to capture approximately 700 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter well above our objective to consistently grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points above market, aided by sales of pandemic-related items. Even when excluding the pandemic sales contribution, we were still well within our targeted range demonstrating consistent traction of our growth initiatives. Moving on to the other businesses. Daily sales increased 8.5% or 8.8% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by continued expansion of our endless assortment business, which was up a combined 17% on a daily basis between both Zoro and MonotaRO. Both businesses continue to grow rapidly and benefited from an uptick in pandemic-related sales albeit a much smaller impact than we saw with our U.S. business. Gross profit margin declined 60 basis points in the quarter driven by business unit mix from the faster growing endless assortment businesses as well as deeper discounting in a higher mix of drop-ship activity at Zoro U.S. We continue to achieve SG&A leverage in the first quarter, resulting in operating margin increase of 80 basis points. This stems largely from decreased expenses at Cromwell and leveraged an endless assortment. Cromwell performed unplanned in Q1 and was able to half its losses from the first quarter of 2019. These results were largely before the pandemic shutdown activity across Europe. We took an impairment charge on our Fabory business, reflecting continued gross profit and a flat to declining EBITDA against the backdrop of industrial sector declines across Europe. This was further amplified by the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic among other factors. Turning to Slide 13. Daily sales decreased 6.1% or 5% on a constant currency basis, comprised of roughly 4% decline in volume and price headwind, which includes customer mix of approximately 1%. Foreign exchange created 110 basis point headwind. Overall operating margins were up 110 basis points as gross profit margin was roughly flat to the prior year period, and SG&A was favorable 110 basis points as cost management drove significant leverage. Looking forward, in addition to the pandemic, Grainger Canada is also combating extremely low oil prices given its more concentrated natural resource customer base, which will drive further headwinds into the second quarter. Before I turn it back to D.G., I want to provide you with some insights into what we are seeing through the first few weeks of April. From a sales perspective, as of April 21, we are seeing year-over-year declines of approximately 10% on a constant currency total company basis with dramatic differences by end-market, product categories and customer size. Not surprisingly, our healthcare essential manufacturing and pockets of government are growing significantly faster year-over-year and we are seeing rapid declines elsewhere in areas such as hospitality and heavy manufacturing. On the product side, safety and cleaning supplies are significantly up year-over-year with most other categories down some dramatically. To be clear, this is what we are seeing through the first 15 business days of the month and not meant to be construed as guidance for the quarter. As in Q1, these customer and product mix items will continue to impact our GP margins. Further, Q2 will be impacted by the change in format of our National Sales Meeting, which will create a year-over-year headwind to gross profit margin of approximately 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the U.S. segment in the second quarter. For the year, the national meeting impact will be a drag on gross profit margin, but will be roughly flat for the year on an operating margin basis given travel and event-related cost savings. With that, I will turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. We have a strong business and balance sheet as well as access to capital and we are taking proactive steps to keep the company healthy and our workforce stable, while continuing to serve our customers well. We take being an essential business very seriously and we are committed to living our purpose and being that critical partner for our customers throughout this pandemic and beyond. While this crisis is certainly different from any that we've experienced, I am confident that Grainger will come away from the stronger than before, and we’ll be positioned to lead this industry for years to come. Now we will open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ryan Merkel: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is well.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Thomas Okray: Good morning, Ryan.
Ryan Merkel: So first off, thanks for the color on April. But I guess high level, and I realize that visibility is low in April guidance. But anything you can help us with in terms of the outlook, maybe thoughts on a range of industry declines this year? Or maybe comment on if 2019 is a good framework in your mind for 2020 or if there is major differences?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I think it's – as Tom said, forecasting right now is very difficult. I think we can say what we are seeing. And as I mentioned, we have some customers that are mostly shutdown. We do, do a lot of work with airlines, which obviously, aren't as busy, cruise lines, as you might guess. As you get into some of the sub-industries, you see very big differences. Obviously there's a bunch of customers that are very, very busy. I think one thing I would say is that the world is not shutdown necessarily and you can see it in our daily volumes. We've been very consistent in the last few weeks and we've been fairly resilient. But it does take on different numbers by different sub-segments. I think the question for us is how long it's going to take to get back and depending on who you talk to, whether it's an epidemiologists or an economists, that could be relatively short or really long. And so there's just uncertainty around that. So Ryan, I would not even try to forecast that. We feel like we are taking the right actions to make sure that we maintain profitability throughout any scenario and we are confident in our ability to gain share. One thing that we didn't talk about, that's kind of interesting is we are seeing a very healthy flow of new customers, given the pandemic requests and we feel like we are going to come out of this with a nice customer file increase as well. But right now, it's really difficult to forecast beyond sort of this month and next month, and it will just be how fast back to work that's going to determine.
Ryan Merkel: Yes. That's fair. I thought I'd ask. All right. And then second, I was hoping SG&A was going to offset the decline in gross margins quarter a little bit better. I know you talked about it a little bit, but just pinpoint for us what exactly happened? It seems to me like you're not making much profit on these pandemic sales, so maybe talk about that. And then, is most of this a timing issue with the price cost and the higher SG&A? And then these trends should start to get a little bit better in 2Q? Just help us with that.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So let me take – I mean, so there's a gross profit and SG&A component to your question. And I'll turn it over to Tom in a minute. From a gross profit perspective, on the pandemic items, we made a decision, which is we're going to help the healthcare infrastructure and help government customers. That decision means, in a scarce supply world, we're basically providing product to contract customers and those products generally are lower margin to begin with. So that does have an impact on gross profit and a fairly significant one in the quarter. It’s the right thing to do. It's absolutely the right thing to do. That's going to relieve over time a little bit because there's going to be more product and there's going to be more customers hopefully that open up and that we can serve. So on the gross profit side, that certainly was an impact, which we'll see in the second quarter. But I think over time that will relieve some. SG&A is a little bit simpler. Over half of our SG&A increase was basically one-time or unusual items. And we feel like growing SG&A half the rate of sales growth is a very comfortable place for us to be going forward given what we know other than the one timers. I'll turn it over to Tom to provide a few details on that one.
Thomas Okray: Yes. So let me add just a little bit more color, Ryan. So let's first of all start with gross profit margin. As we said in our prepared remarks, we went heavy on pricing in Q1 of fiscal year 2019 and then we rolled that back throughout the year. So to your point, that pricing compare will get better throughout the year. Also from a cost perspective, if you just look at how the tariffs behave on a year-over-year basis, the two big tariffs for us are Part 3 and Part 4A. And from a year-over-year impact for Part 3, in fiscal year 2019, the tariff was 10% in Q1, it's 25% in Q1 this year. If we look at 4A, there was no tariff and there's 15% or 7.5%. So that is the tariff impact that we saw on Q1. That also will get better throughout the year as we fully realize the lapping of our tariffs. It will also get better from the realization of our non-tariff cost increases. Let me move to SG&A and unpack it a little bit better than we did in the prepared remarks. We were up $47 million on a total company basis, which is a 6.4% increase. If you do look at the one-time items and that includes, one-time legal matters, the extra payroll day. We also had some benefits issue where we were lapping prior year adjustments and some other one-time costs. D.G. said over 50%, it was actually closer to 60% of the $47 million. So if you adjust that out, we really grew 2.7%, which gets into about half of the sales growth. The increase of the 2.7% is on items where we have said that we are investing related to advertising, technology and adding headcount in the back half. Now having said that, we noted in the prepared remarks that we are scaling back on advertising, we are taking a stronger look on costs in terms of taking $40 million to $55 million out sequentially versus Q1. And then the final thing I'll say is I want to be clear that we did also have additional cost to serve the pandemic in terms of over time pandemic pay, cleaning supplies, and those types of items. But the big story in SG&A is the one-time as well as the investment cost, which we will roll back in the second quarter. Sorry for the long winded answer, but it was a broad question. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.
David Manthey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Grainger used to give us growth ranges across customer end markets on a monthly basis. And just given the circumstances, is there any chance that we could get general growth rates for March across the end markets on Slide 17? 
Donald Macpherson: We'll get back to you on that. It might be more valuable to give you ranges on April frankly than March.
David Manthey: Yes. Okay.
Donald Macpherson: We'll get back to you on that and decide whether or not we're going to do any of that. I would say it's – if you saw it, it would not be all that surprising. As I mentioned before, there are certain segments, sub-segments that are down tremendously and almost 90%, 70%. And there are certain that are up significantly, and they would be exactly the ones you think. So I don't think you'd be surprised by any of it, but we'll talk about whether or not we're going to provide that as we go through the pandemics.
David Manthey: I appreciate it. And second, you saw really nice growth in endless assortment, which was also an area of recent investment. Did you say that half of the 17% growth rate was COVID related?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. That's the U.S. That's the Zoro. Yes. Now let me just give a little bit of caveat to that. If you do it on a product basis, that's true. But even customers that are heavy COVID product buyers, spent less on other things as the month went on. And so it's a bit of a rough estimate. So I don't want to over index on that. We feel like we want to be very careful about saying how much was COVID. But certainly from a product perspective, that's true.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Nigel Coe: Thanks guys. Good morning. Really appreciate the detail. I just wanted to just pick up on the SG&A. Obviously, you've provided a lot of good detail on that already. But as we go into 2Q and if sales continue to trend down 10%. I mean, who knows, but we expect that 50% of sales growth or sales declines to hold, D.G. or Tom? Do the impacts of some of these sequential improvements in cost such as the – I think you mentioned $40 million, $50 million of sequential declines in costs. Does that mean that SG&A could be down a bit more than that? Just wondering how we should think about SG&A going forward for the rest of the year?
Donald Macpherson: Tom, do you want to take that one?
Thomas Okray: Sure. Yes, it’s a great question, Nigel. I think it depends Nigel on how much we see the volume going down quite frankly. If volume is going to stay where it's at in terms of 10%, we're probably not going to pull the more draconian levers in terms of cost reduction. It goes deeper than that. Then we've got a number of initiatives in the playbook ready to pull it. If you look at the high side of the range we gave Nigel, that $55 million sequentially would translate to year-over-year, almost 3% reduction. We'd also get some volume variable cost reduction in addition to that. So I think it's going to be a meaningful SG&A reduction for Q2. But we're watching this on a daily basis and trying to really thread the needle in terms of which levers we pull related to the volume reduction.
Nigel Coe: Got it. That's helpful. And threading the needle is what we're trying to do so. I understand that. And then just on the mix factor, again, you spent a lot of time talk about mix, but the one point of mix pressure you saw in 1Q, we all get it, we understand what's driving that. What would that normally be? Because obviously, the national accounts outgrowth, normally, we're facing some mix pressures. What would that normally be? Where does that reside? Does it normally reside within the price buckets or the volume buckets? And then how does mix – how do you think mix will trends to – again, I hate to be so short-term here, but do you think mix pressures accelerates into 2Q or remained pretty steady?
Thomas Okray: Yes. I mean, you're talking specifically Nigel about gross profit or you're talking about sales revenue.
Nigel Coe: Talking here about – well, I guess both, I mean, mix impacts, mainly gross margin, but whatever is the better answer.
Thomas Okray: Yes. If you look at it from a revenue perspective, we've actually got some customer mix component, which is in volume, but the majority of it is going to fall into price. We mentioned in our prepared remarks, the multi-site customers, but that was a much smaller part of the mix component. The primary part of it was our lower margin healthcare and government customers. That was the big driver of the customer mix.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I would just add to that, Nigel that we very recently, like the last few days, we started to get inquiries from midsized customers thinking about restarting. They've been on fairly hard shutdown. So that has been a negative mix depending on how fast some of those midsized customers come back. The mix issues could be alleviated a bit. We would expect though for the next – certainly for April, and probably for a lot of May, we would expect some of those mixed pressures, and then hopefully as everybody gets back to work, we would see those does alleviate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. Just if we look at Zoro and/or Zoro and MonotaRO, I’m curious about the possibility of a net benefit this year with the online effect actually benefiting from distancing? Or otherwise, if there's maybe a divergent experience of the COVID recession for the endless assortment versus the U.S. segment?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So I can take that one. So Japan has not had yet a hard shutdown like some of the other markets we've seen. Certainly we've seen the online model there do very, very well. In Zoro, in the U.S., Zoro has done quite well as well. And in particular from a new customer acquisition, as new customers look for different solutions that are digital, we're seeing a very strong new customer pipeline coming into Zoro. We also see a lot of that going on to the Grainger online as well from – on grainger.com. So there is certainly a shift to digital and we think we're well positioned for that shift, both with assortment model, but also with grainger.com, which is an exceptional solution for industrial businesses. So we feel like we're well positioned for that shift.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And on the U.S. segment, half of the growth was non-pandemic and the absolute gross gotten better as the benchmark slowed down, certainly the spread, curious if you think more of that is for the – due to the price per share dynamics on the large contracts enacted last year or if it's more broadly the Grainger system and market penetration tail on the heels of the 2017 resets.
Donald Macpherson: I think it's everything that we're doing. I think it's the growth initiatives we've talked about. We're getting good results out of merchandising, nice results and more efficient marketing. We've added some focus to our KeepStock. So we're providing more inventory management solutions for customers. I think, very little of it is actually the price dynamic and more of it is the actions that we're taking to drive growth.
Thomas Okray: Yes, I guess the one thing that I would add that might be helpful color is when you look at our share gain, we said it was 700 bps outgrowth in Q1, if you look at it in March, it was significantly higher than that, almost double share gain in terms of March, which would lead you to potentially conclude that when times get really tough, the good things that we're doing, the customers are coming to us and allowing us to take share.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Uhlman: Hi guys. Good morning. Hope the whole team is healthy. I had a follow-up question on the gross margin discussion for the second quarter. Understand there are a lot of moving pieces and thanks for the detail on the national sales meeting for the headwind there. But any way that we could frame how much further down we should be bracing for the gross margin to slip in the second quarter? I mean, are we talking about a couple of hundred basis points of this mix headwind we're seeing in April persist?
Thomas Okray: Yes, sure. It's really hard to predict, Adam, because we have good guys happening in terms of the compare of the price inflation going down materially in the second quarter. We've also got better lapping in terms of inflation, non-tariff inflation and tariffs inflation. So those are really good things. It's just so hard to predict the pandemic of how much of an offset. And it really comes back to D.G.'s point is when are the other non-pandemic businesses really going to start to come back to work. So we've got a big chunk of tailwinds. It's just we don't know how big the headwind would be, not trying to be evasive, it's just hard to call the ball right now.
Adam Uhlman: Okay, got it. And then just on a different topic, any way to frame how much of your customer base is closed right now? And then secondly, there's probably some customers that are restricting access for vending or what have you, any broad sense of how much your sales force is limited right now? Thanks.
Donald Macpherson: Yeah. So we have a number of customers that we cannot get into refill vending ourselves, but we flipped most of them to customer managed inventory. Most of those customers have people working. I would say it's very difficult to say how many are really closed, but certainly it's – a portion of the business is really closed. As I said, if we looked in the four groups, the ones that are really busy right now, you kind of say 10-40-40-10, meaning 10% are really busy, 40% are less impacted essential businesses, 40% are non-essential but they're really – they are working on some sort of reduced schedule, and 10% roughly are what we would call disrupted. And so those are businesses that have a significant disruption right now, that aren't doing a whole lot. They may not be fully closed, but for all intents and purposes, they're closed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First question is for Tom. And it's the outlook on free cash flow for the year just in terms of the playbook for industrial distributors, typically you'd be selling down from inventory with lower demand that typically gives you a boost on free cash flow conversion, maybe you're also pulling back some CapEx, but just kind of give us the dynamics there from a free cash flow perspective.
Thomas Okray: Yes. Good morning, Deane. Yes, we feel really good about our free cash flow. If you look at our cash conversion cycle, despite us working with customers to be constructive in terms of payment terms, we were actually better by four days versus the prior year quarter. So we feel that we're managing working capital really well. As it relates to the destocking of inventory, frankly, that's not the playbook we're running. We're positioned for the future here. When the recovery starts to happen, and those customers start coming back, we want to make sure that we're able to provide the benefit to them. We feel that we're uniquely positioned with our balance sheet and our liquidity to be able to really come out of the gate strong when the market takes off.
Deane Dray: That's a helpful ending for that answer because that's what I'd like to ask D.G. about, and not asking about the timing of the recovery, because no one really knows at this stage. But D.G., you suggested there'd be ways that Grainger would come out stronger, you've added customers, but I'm also interested in what you think changes about the business in terms of your customer base, their inventory levels that will carry. I mean, it used to be just in time, now it's more some buffer inventory just in case maybe you have to do more cleaning of your DCs, just the dynamics of what changes on the other side, both from customer behavior, maybe adding more customers and maybe some incremental costs as just standard business going forward. Thanks.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So thanks, Deane. I said you can't predict what's going to happen. My assumption is that, for a while, we're going to be in a situation where we have to be careful around the virus on some level even if businesses are back to work. And so over the short to mid-term, I think there's going to be a lot of questions around, do we have the right stock of cleaning supplies and PPE to make sure we can actually work. And so we're already talking to customers, talking with customers about how to come back to work and how can we help them, think about how to come back to work. And so that's going to be a big, big topic. Whether or not we turn to more buffer inventories or not is debatable. We've had shocks in the past and it hasn't changed behavior. This one feels like it could. So I'm guessing that we are going to be in a position where we're helping customers think more about inventory stocks than we have in the past for certain products. I still think that, us managing inventory and keeping inventory levels down is going to be an important topic for most customers going forward. But certainly there is going to be some industries that are very, very different and there's going to be some that are new, and we're going to have to navigate through that and we've already started talking about that. In terms of our own business, I think we're all going to have to be more careful. We're thinking differently about how our buildings are configured. Most of our distribution centers have been designed to bring people into lunch rooms, for example, for camaraderie. Well, right now, that doesn't make as much sense. And so we're talking about, well, how do we view – how do we have multiple lunch box. There's just all kinds of details that we're working through that are going to change. And I think it's – we're just going to have the same priorities, keep our team members safe, serve our customers well, do it responsibly and that's going to be the focus. And we have a team of pandemic team that's working on all those operational issues right now and how to get back to work and how we operate in the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.
John Inch: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. D.G., I'm wondering, given the new Fabory write-downs, if you could update us on your strategic thoughts on retaining or divesting either Cromwell or Fabory. How are you thinking about that framework, particularly against what's happening in the economy?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, I mean, we're always evaluating the portfolio and looking at whether or not we should be investing or not in businesses. Now is no different. We continue to look at all of our businesses and we can't comment obviously on specific actions that we plan to take. But certainly, we are looking at businesses. Those two businesses are important ones to look at. One thing I would point out is, it's kind of interesting, Cromwell and Canada both, before the pandemic, in the quarter, actually were on expectations, which was good to see. So we actually were getting a little bit of traction with both of those businesses, which was great. And then of course, the world changed. And for Cromwell, we're excited to see if we can continue on a strong path and Canada as well. So I would say, we continue to look at those portfolio, we'll continue to do that consistently.
John Inch: Yes. That's fine. I appreciate the answer, I had thought perhaps you had put them on kind of a timeline, if my memory serves, you're going to sort of wait for the trend to profit or whatever. Just as a follow-up, I'm wondering if you could also comment on Zoro. Obviously it's done really well and, period, could take a lot of virtual share coming out of this. I'm just wondering like how you're thinking about the pandemic in the context of possibly maybe monetizing that business down the road, maybe along with just like the whole endless assortment. Does this, in theory, push that out or does it pull forward, or does it not really have much of any impact thus far?
Donald Macpherson: It's going to have a – obviously, who knows, but I don't see in terms of how long this lasts. But I think that it doesn't have a lot of impact to our timing. So Masaya Suzuki is running MonotaRO, he's been the CEO of MonotaRO, he now is in charge of Zoro in both the UK and U.S. They are working very hard to improve the profitability and growth rates of both of those businesses. We're seeing good traction. At some point, that question may become more near-term, but right now, they're really focused on improving the business and working together to make sure we do that. So that's the focus right now.
John Inch: Thank you very much.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Baumann of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Patrick Baumann: Thanks. Good morning, D.G. Good morning, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions.
Donald Macpherson: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick Baumann: Hi. Just the first one, maybe within the 10% decline in April date. Just curious if you could provide a range of growth you're seeing in safety and cleaning supplies or whatever you consider to be pandemic-related, and then how long a tail you see on that demand, if you look at the backlog of request for those products. And then, it would also be helpful on those lines to understand like what percentage of your business is pandemic-related products or what you consider could be that?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So we haven't released those numbers. Pandemic-related items are, I wouldn't say, way up, silly numbers, in the backlog is even sillier than that, to be frank. So I mentioned it on the call, I mentioned it on the prepared remarks, we literally took orders for decades worth of product in a few days in some cases. And so we continue to get product in. We continue to prioritize. We've had to change our processes for those items and depends how much I guess you feel – the length of time that we have increased sales of pandemic items depends in large part on whether or not you believe the backlog is real. In many cases it is real, depending on what happens. Some of that might not happen. But certainly we have a big backlog of those products and continue to – we'll continue to sell those. Pandemic is a minority of the total product, but it's not a small minority. It's a significant portion of what we're selling, normally cleaning and safety and our big product categories for us in general.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. And then just a follow-up would be on margins. In the first quarter, you had lower margins despite higher sales for all the reasons that you discussed. I'm just wondering if you could give any color on what kind of range we should be thinking about for decremental margins if sales are down, say 10%. I think last downturn, decrementals were only like 20%, but this one seems a little bit different. So just curious how you think about that.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Tom, you want to take that one?
Thomas Okray: Sure. Decremental margin is an interesting calculation especially in the pandemic, just because there are – assumptions are so related to volume deterioration and gross margin. You referenced 2008 or 2009, there is a little bit of a nuance there where I don't think it's apples to oranges, as you said, we had big pricing impact back in 2008 and 2009, which, when dated, the decremental margin. If you're looking at 10% down with a range of, I guess, a reasonable gross margin, I could see decremental margins being 45% to maybe 50% down, and that's largely driven by – if it's only 10% down, we're probably not going to do those draconian cost initiatives. On the other hand, if we start to get for a more severe downturn with a longer duration, then we would go to our cost initiative playbook that we've got ready and pull more of the SG&A cost initiatives and there I could see the decremental margin being 35% to 40%. So it's really highly sensitive on what you're assuming. Hopefully that's helpful to give you a range.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Dankert of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Christopher Dankert: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Positive I missed it. Did you stake out what national account growth was in the quarter? Just any update you can give on kind of the C-suite executive sales growth initiatives. I assume you've had a lot more touch points in the midst of the virus, but maybe to less access, so just any comments on that national accounts growth plan.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, I think we've seen solid growth. We've had a number of wins. I think any first quarter number is going to be inflated due to the pandemic, because all of our healthcare business is basically on corporate accounts. But we continue to see good traction with our corporate accounts and coming out of this, we think we're going to be in a position to get growth up and share gain up with those national accounts. I would say there's no real change in terms of the strategy. We have had a number of wins and we feel very confident about the path we're on with our corporate accounts.
Christopher Dankert: Got it. If I could just sneak one last one in here. Circling back to Zoro really quickly, Masaya has been on board for two, three months now. Just any color on sort of the biggest investment opportunities or optimization he may have highlighted. Has anything changed there? Just high level thoughts on where we're going strategically there?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, I think there is some significant changes. I think the team is thinking hard about discounting strategy, when to run targeted discounts versus big promotions, my guess is we will move to more targeted discounts, lower discount rates for acquisition, spending a lot of time thinking about which customers. We're attracting and getting the attractive business customers and what actually it takes to win those and get those to be consistent purchasers. And so I think the team is really working hard on those things and the size is certainly helping them think through a whole range of issues around how to grow but how to grow with improved thoughts.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. Hope you're all safe and healthy. My first question is just on medium customers. What are you hearing there? I know you referenced most of them are shutdown, but any update on strategy to gain share there and whether in a downturn, you had mentioned you've – historically you've gained share, does that also apply on the medium customer base or is that sort of different versus large customers?
Donald Macpherson: No, I think it really applies for mid-sized customers. I think that – so certainly we've seen more impact in mid-sized customers, more of those customers have been closed. That said, we continued to see nice returns from our marketing activity with mid-sized customers and our inventory position and our ability to provide strong service typically works very, very well in this situation and we would expect these customers to come back on, that we will be able to acquire more which we've been doing and also increase volumes pretty significantly. So we're pretty excited about that path. As I mentioned, we're starting to get, inquiries from mid-sized customers about, can you help us, that are new. And new mid-sized customers, can you help us get back up and running? And that's really exciting to see and so we're going to work very hard to capitalize on that.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. And my follow-up question is on Zoro and you may have touched on this, so I apologize if it's repetition, but how independent is that supply chain today from parent company GWW and any thoughts on re-segmenting that for more visibility? Is it sort of a different tech platform than sort of the parent business? Any thoughts as to independence of that business today versus years ago and then sort of, I know it's buried in other businesses, but any thoughts on re-segmentation? Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So let me answer both of those. The first one, a lot of the investments we've made in the last year have gotten Zoro a lot more independence and so while they still rely on Grainger supply chain in many cases, they are becoming less and less reliant as they have other partners that provide delivery service for them to their customers. And so a lot of what we're doing is making that business more independent and operating it more similar to what MonotaRO does, which is to leverage multiple third-parties for low volume items to really drive the growth. In terms of segments, we will follow SEC guidelines and we will think through segments during this year and we'll get back to you by the end of the year if there's going to be any difference.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael McGinn of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael McGinn: Thanks, appreciate the time. If I can go back to the margin discussion real quick, the $40 million to $55 million of SG&A savings identified, is that a fixed numbers or does that include also some flex down as a percent of sales?
Thomas Okray: It includes some amount of flex down but not fully all of the flex down. So we would expect that we would get additional volume variable over and above the $40 million to $55 million.
Michael McGinn: Okay. So assuming the $40 million to $55 million, you're thinking about a 728 base, plus you're saying additional percentage of sales savings. So that would put us somewhere in – I think my back of the envelope math, in 8% operating margin, which is 200 basis points below the 2009 trough. Is that the way to think about this for just this downturn as it stands without the additional actions faced too?
Thomas Okray: I think the way to think about SG&A, let's just take the $55 million SG&A reduction at the high end. If you compare that, what we did in Q2 for SG&A, that would be roughly a $20 million reduction or about 3%. Now depending on where volume tracks to, you're going to get some additional volume variables. So I would look at it as you're going to get 3-plus percent in terms of SG&A reduction versus the prior year.
Michael McGinn: Okay. And then just quickly on the PPE, you mentioned large sales, blanket purchase orders, have you collected deposits for those or are those tangible or how do you see those progressing throughout the year?
Donald Macpherson: Well, it depends. I mean for most orders in the backlog, we would not have deposits collected. For large special orders, we would often have deposits collected. But in terms of the backlog, we don't typically get payment until we actually ship and bill.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today will be coming from Justin Bergner of G.research. Please go ahead, sir.
Justin Bergner: Hi, D.G. and Tom, and thanks for fitting me in. Good work on everything the company is doing. I guess what hasn't been covered, which stood out was the retail sales up mid-20s. Are you seeing sort of an acceleration there besides the COVID-19 demand? How large as a percent of your business is that? Again, are the margins there mix dilutive when you normalize for sort of COVID-19 product or they mix similar or mix accretive?
Donald Macpherson: Well, so retail for us typically is serving distribution centers that serve retail and so we have very large customers that are e-commerce players typically that would fall in there. That is slightly mix dilutive as a customer group, certainly, but it's also a very important customer group. And so what we're talking about there is typically serving the industrial side of retail as opposed to retail stores. And most, right now, what we've seen is almost all e-commerce traffic as you probably realize is way up. And so our business to distribution centers that are serving that e-commerce traffic is way up.
Justin Bergner: Got it. Good work there. And then just a follow-up question is on the SG&A cost being higher in the quarter. Did some of that flow through corporate unallocated costs? Because that's going to be up materially year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Were there any other dynamics there in the corporate cost market?
Thomas Okray: No, I would – it was about – half of that was flowing through the corporate unallocated. And if you adjust for that, we're very comparable to last year in the corporate unallocated. And in terms of looking at it on a full year basis, we should not be materially different in the corporate unallocated. So it's a good question, Justin. Half of that was corporate unallocated.
Operator: Thank you. This brings us to the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to D.G. for closing comments.
Donald Macpherson: Great. Well, thanks for joining us today. I really hope all of you are safe and healthy. I just want to reiterate that we are doing everything we can to help. And helping the health crisis first is the most important thing so that we can all get back to work. We've taken a lot of action to ensure that we can continue to operate, serve our customers very well during this time, keep our team members safe and make sure we're in a strong financial position. We view this as, certainly a short term threat, but we view it as a long term opportunity. We think we're going to come out of this stronger, we think we're going to gain customers. We think we're going to find all kinds of new opportunities coming out of this and we are already starting to work those and we already have some get-to-work plans already in place. So we're really excited about the future. Thank you for spending the time with us and really appreciate that and please be safe and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today’s event. You may disconnect your lines or logoff the webcast at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the W.W. Grainger Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's fourth earnings and full-year 2019 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables of the end of the slide presentation and in our Q4 press release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2019 which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings press release. Now I will turn it over to DG.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks Irene. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. On today’s call, I will talk about our 2019 performance and key accomplishments and discuss our growth priorities for 2020. Tom will then cover our financial performance for the quarter and the year in detail as well as our 2020 guidance. Late last year, we introduced our team members to the Grainger Edge, our new strategic framework that defines who we are, why we exist, and how we work together to achieve our objectives. At Grainger, our purpose is to keep the world working. Whether that means helping a hospital focus on patient care, a manufacturing plant focus on building great products, or school focus on teaching. The work we do in the background helps keep facilities running, so our customers can focus on what they do best. It's a purpose that we’re all very proud of as an organization. The framework also outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors we expect from our team members working with each other, our customers and our supplier partners. We are holding ourselves accountable to these principles and believe they will help us execute our strategy and create value for our shareholders. These are not just words on a page. We’re committed to making these principles come to life in everything that we do. The Grainger Edge provides a foundational framework for our strategies we work to consistently serve our customers and gain share. We gain share through two distinct business models that allow us to leverage our scale and supply chain to support customers with different needs. Our high-touch solutions model serves customers that have complex needs and are looking for more tailored solutions. Through this model, we develop powerful customer solutions, deliver a great customer experience, and develop deep customer relationships. This all starts with what we call advantaged MRO solutions. That means being able to get a customer the exact product they need to solve a problem quickly. And it means understanding more about our products and customers than anyone in order to help them solve problems and to create value for our customers. This takes the form of intuitive digital solutions, segment specific solutions, and value-added services. We then leverage these solutions to our talented sales and services teams to build deep customer relationships based on an exceptional customer experience.  Our Grainger U.S., Canada and Mexico operations as well as our crumble and favorite businesses stick within this model. In our endless assortment model, we provide less complex customers with an expansive product assortment and easy to use website. This business is based on acquiring customers and leveraging our simple and efficient customer experience to develop and maintain strong customer relationships. Our MonotaRO and Zoro businesses fit within this model. When we execute against these two models, we consistently gain share, we grow profitably, and we deliver strong shareholder value. That's our commitment. Flipping to Slide 5 and before I jump into 2019 highlights, I wanted to touch briefly on work we have done over the last few years to strengthen the business and to position Grainger for success. This work has ensured that both our high-touch solutions model and our endless assortment model have the capabilities to win in the marketplace. Most of you are familiar with the pricing reset of our U.S. business back in 2017. This change has allowed us to grow with customer groups we’ve been losing share with for years, most notably midsize customers. But beyond the pricing actions, we have made important news: we have verticalized our salesforce. Our customers today demand more expertise from our interactions and this change enables our sales teams to develop domain knowledge and deepen customer relationships. We have added an inside sales group focused on high-value midsized customers. We have centralized our call centers to improve service and scale and help manage costs. We have restructured our feedstock inventory management program, and we now have begun expanding capabilities for our customers. We've added capacity to our U.S. supply chain. We have made significant improvements to grainger.com to make search easier for our customers. And we've done all this while realizing significant leverage on our cost structure. These changes let us set the stage for what we accomplished in 2019 and will accomplish moving forward. Outside of the U.S. business, we have reset the foundation for our Canadian operations for what we believe will become a consistently profitable and growing business. We have shed non-core international businesses over the last few years and are now focusing our efforts on places where we can create a meaningful, profitable, and competitively advantage position. Our attention and focus moving forward will be on a high-touch solutions model primarily in North America, as well as our growing endless assortment model. We continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure our time, energy, and investment is spent, where we can add the most value for the long-term. Our execution on these efforts over the last few years has laid a strong foundation for profitable growth for the new decade. Moving to Slide 6, as you heard from our competitors, suppliers, and customers, our market was certainly challenging in 2019 with market growth declining as the year progressed. In the face of these challenges, the Grainger team delivered solid results for the year, mainly in line with the expectations we outlined back in January 2019. To be clear, we’re thrilled with the absolute performance in the year but it was solid on a comparable basis. For the total company, we drove 3% daily sales growth across the company on a constant currency basis. From a profitability perspective, we expanded total company operating margin by 10 basis points in 2019, driven by continued success in leveraging our SG&A, the team did a nice job managing spend in 2019, and we achieved our goal to minimize SG&A growth for less than half the rate of our sales growth. We expect to continue driving leverages we prudently manage costs while also growing the business. We generated over $1 billion of cash in 2019 and returned roughly the same amount to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. While the absolute numbers were decent in many ways, 2019 was a strong year on the execution front that we believe sets us up well going forward. In the U.S., we outgrew the MRO market by 150 to 200 basis points in 2019 and our outperformance to the market gained momentum throughout the year. We exited the fourth quarter growing about 300 basis points faster than the market. This performance is driven by our ongoing investments in growth initiatives which support our strategy. We remerchandised $1.2 billion of products in 2019 more than double any time in our history and we’re on track to complete another $1.6 billion in 2020. These category reviews along with marketing activities are driving incremental revenue. We've been testing these strategies and are happy with results thus far. Return on ad spend steadily increased over the course of the year. We saw nice improvements in the focus of our sales and services team, particularly around embedding Grainger and our customers to keep stock and value-added services. We reenergized our large corporate account efforts and won some significant contracts in the second half. Our high-touch offers unmatched in the market, and we believe we will continue to gain share with these important strategic customers. In our endless assortment model, we grew revenue 19% in 2019 driven by strong growth at both MonotaRO and Zoro. We invested to enhance our Zoro offering in 2019 including the addition of roughly 1.5 million skews to the assortment, pushing the total skew count to about 3.5 million products. We made significant enhancements to Zoro’s technology capabilities, including the launch of a new product information system and a customer analytics platform allowing Zoro to be less reliant on Grainger's infrastructure. We also improved our marketing capabilities at Zoro which would help us gain share profitably moving forward. In our Grainger Canada business we saw revenue stabilize and customer feedback improve significantly throughout 2019. We expect to return to growth in the business in the back half of 2020 and are confident the platform we have in Canada will prove to be sustainable and profitable in the future. Even when our results were poor, we made progress. Specifically our Cromwell business in the UK had a very challenging financial year. For context, adjusted total company operating margin in 2019 would have been 12.7% without Cromwell or 60 basis point improvement. Further, we took a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to write-off substantially all of the intangible assets, including trade names and customer lists. That said the business made great strides in service and our customers are now talking about Cromwell moving forward. We also took action in the fourth quarter to take £10 million of administration costs out of the business. This team has great clarity and understands the urgency required to improve the performance of the business going forward. So while 2019 was certainly challenging, we’re proud of the work we completed to position us for success moving forward. Turning to 2020, we plan to continue investing to support our strategy. Our expectation is that we will consistently outgrow the market including a target of 300 to 400 basis points of outperformance in our core high-touch business in the U.S. Historically, we've grown approximately 150 basis points faster than the market. Our actions and investments over the last several years provide confidence that we can grow at a more accelerated rate. In 2020, we are focused on several initiatives to support that growth. We will continue to work the work we began in 2019 to remerchandise our assortment to ensure we have the right products to serve the needs of our customers. For 2020, this includes remerchandising $1.6 billion of products, including selected skew additions to enhance our assortment. We expect to continue to learn and improve upon the way we execute our marketing activities. We've learned a lot over the last couple of years including analytics focused evaluations around our investments in search and display, radio, catalog and direct marketing. We expect improved share gain from both incremental marketing investments and from effective marketing in 2020. We remain focused on bolstering our expertise in digital and technology solutions in order to serve a more sophisticated and tech enabled customer base. We recently went live with the first version of our new product information system and had made great improvements with our customer information; both support our merchandising, and marketing efforts. We will invest to enhance our customer experience and strengthen our world-class customer service backbone through network capacity and utilization investments. With our Louisville DC coming online soon, we're at a point where focused investments in DC capacity, while significant service benefits without as much capital outlays we've seen in the recent past. We're also planning to selectively add sellers to be more relevant in certain segments and geographies. And we will equip our sales organization with the right tool set to ensure they can serve our customers most effectively. We have developed improved processes with large multi-site customers and continue to be aggressive in helping these customers consolidate with Grainger. We will continue to embed our solutions with a more complex customers to our inventory management offerings. Finally we remain committed to the ongoing turnaround efforts in Canada and with our Cromwell business in the UK. In Canada, the business was slightly profitable 2019 and as Tom will explain, we expect to roughly breakeven again in 2020. This business is now structured to run as an extension of our core U.S. operations. This will help us make the needed strides to return the business to meaningful profitability over the course of the next couple of years by demonstrating a consistent uptick in revenue and margins. For Cromwell, I mentioned their struggles in 2019. This is a business that is at a crossroads right now. We need to start seeing progress over the next 12 to 18 months to assess whether the business can run profitably. We've made great improvements in service which are expected to translate into revenue and profitability. Our team will be evaluating this closely in 2020. Successful execution of these initiatives will position us to consistently and profitably outperform the market in 2020 and beyond. Now, let's talk about our endless assortment business. First and foremost, we’re pleased to have announced earlier this morning that Masaya Suzuki, the current CEO of MonotaRO will now lead the combined endless assortment business across Grainger. I am personally very excited about this. Masaya was part of the founding team at MonotaRO and has been instrumental in the tremendously profitable growth with this business as we first launched 20 years ago. He has also played a critical role in the launch of Zoro in 2011. Under Masaya’s leadership, we expect to continue the strong growth and profitability of our endless assortment businesses. In the U.S., we plan to accelerate Zoro’s adoption of the MonotaRO playbook in order to capture growth and implement best practices. Specifically, we plan to continue to rapidly expand Zoro’s assortment beyond the $130 billion industrial MRO market. This will allow us to tap into markets and customers that aren't served through other greater channels. Our goal is to have 10 million skews in the Zoro portfolio in the next three to five years, utilizing third-party suppliers with direct fulfillment capabilities. This has worked well for MonotaRO which has 20 million skews and we’re confident will work for Zoro as well. We're also continuing to develop and improve our marketing and customer segmentation tools at Zoro. We made most of these investments in 2019 and expect to start to see the results here in 2020. For Zoro UK, we will continue to leverage the Cromwell supply chain and execute our strategy to grow the business and drive profitability. These efforts include expanding assortments, enhancing website functionality, and launching effective marketing and customer acquisition campaigns to create a vibrant marketplace. The Zoro UK business continues to grow very quickly and the economics of this business looks to be quite attractive. We expect this business to be profitable in 2021. And for MonotaRO, Masaya and his team will continue to execute their successful growth strategy, including additions to the assortment and network enhancements to improve reliability and speed. This business has produced impressive and profitable growth year in and year out, and we expect that to continue. Our endless assortment business has been a great asset for Grainger and we see the opportunity for tremendous growth moving forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for detail on our 2019 performance and 2020 guidance.
Tom Okray: Thanks, DG. I'll start with a recap of our 2019 total company adjusted results, then move forward to the fourth quarter results by segment. Overall, we're pleased with our 2019 performance despite a challenging environment. Sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by 2.5% from volume and price favorability of 0.5%. FX had a negative 0.5% impact. It should be noted that our core U.S. and endless assortment business combined grew at 5% in the full-year. Consistent with our guide, our gross profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the prior-year. The decline was primarily driven by our lower margin endless assortment business, which is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the company. Contributing to the decline, both MonotaRO and Zoro had lower gross margin. MonotaRO faced freight headwinds in Japan and Zoro’s lower gross margin was driven by unfavorable product mix and promotional activities. Elsewhere, slightly lower gross profit margins in the U.S. were offset by higher gross margins in Canada driven by supply chain favorability. Despite meaningful investments in advertising, technology, and Zoro, we drove SG&A leverage driven by continued cost management actions. SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points year-over-year as our SG&A spend remained flat to 2018. As a result, total company operating margins for the year increased 10 basis points with a 20 basis point improvement in the U.S. Incremental margin for the total company was 17% aided by 22% U.S. incremental margin. We generated operating cash flow of over $1 billion, which we use to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders, returning north of $1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. We did this while maintaining a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times. Operating cash flow was 116% of net earnings; our return on invested capital was 29.3% or 80 basis points favorable to the prior-year. All-in considering the choppy market, we’re pleased with the results. Looking at the quarter, daily sales increased 3% including 3.5% from volume partially offset by 0.5% unfavorable price. Gross profit margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points due to business unit mix, as well as mix shift headwinds within our large customer group in the U.S. These impacts were partially offset by favorable supply chain improvements in Canada. SG&A costs increased 3% but slightly less than sales growth, driven by marketing and technology spend in the U.S. segment and investments to support Zoro’s growth. We could have dialed back spend in the quarter to achieve a better short-term profitability outcome. But we’re focused on driving sustainable value over the long-term and continued investment in the business supports this effort. Operating margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter as SG&A leverage was more than offset by the decline in gross profit margin versus the prior-year. Earnings per share decreased 2% in the quarter due to a higher tax rate as we lapped the prior-year benefit from our clean energy investments. Looking at our performance in the U.S. I'll start with sales for our large and mid-sized customers. The U.S. MRO market in line with macroeconomic indicators declined throughout the year. We estimate that the U.S. MRO market was flat to down 1% in the fourth quarter, and was up 0.5% to 1% for the full-year. In the fourth quarter, our U.S. large customer business grew 3% or 350 basis points faster than the market. Outperformance to the market for large customers accelerated sequentially as our growth initiatives began to take hold. Our U.S. midsize customer business grew 5% or approximately 550 basis points faster than the market. It's important to note that our growth with these two customer groups remain stable despite slower market conditions in the quarter. Overall U.S. segment daily sales grew 2.5% in the quarter or about 300 basis points faster than the market. Sales growth in the quarter included 3% from volume partially offset by unfavorable price of 1%, inter-company sales provided a 0.5% positive impact in the quarter. As noted in our last call, balancing market based pricing with cost, inflation and share gain led to a choppy price result throughout the year. Having said that, we finished the full-year with favorable price of 0.5%. While gross profit margin was up 50 basis points sequentially, we were down 100 basis points year-over-year driven by a few factors, including the growth of inter-company sales and lower margins, the lapping of prior-year supplier rebates, and a mix shift within our large customer subgroup. We've gotten more aggressive in helping large multi-site customers consolidate spend with Grainger. This includes pursuing new customers where we won a few significant contracts in the second half of 2019, as well as deepening and broadening relationships with our current customers. This large customer growth can create a drag on gross margins in the short to medium term, while we demonstrate our value proposition and expand share of wallet with these customers. However this is absolutely the right strategy to drive long-term profitable growth. As we add and expand customer relationships, we're gaining share and more deeply embedding Grainger into what our customers do each and every day. Given the lumpiness of our pricing actions in 2019, we think looking at gross margin on the full-year is more meaningful. In this regard, our full-year margins were down 30 basis points, reflecting the remaining impact of contract renegotiations and large customer mix headwinds. Ultimately, we remain confident in our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases. SG&A costs were flat on 2% sales growth and was favorable 60 basis points to the prior-year. Operating margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter as the decline in gross profit margin was only partially offset by strong SG&A leverage. Looking at Op margin for the full-year, the U.S. segment operating margin was 15.8% which is in line with the guidance we set in January of last year and represents an expansion of 20 basis points. Moving on to other businesses, daily sales increased 9.5% including 7.5% from volume and 2% from favorable FX. Growth was driven by continued expansion of our endless assortment business, which is up a combined 18% between Zoro and MonotaRO. Gross profit margin declined 10 basis points in the quarter driven by negative mix resulting from faster growth in endless assortment. Operating margin declined 140 basis points driven primarily by investments in Zoro and performance at Cromwell. Cromwell generated an operating loss of $35 million for the full-year. Further, while not reflected in our adjusted results, we took an impairment charge in the quarter to write-off substantially all of the remaining intangible assets in our Cromwell business. Turning to Slide 16, daily sales decreased 11.5% including 10% related to volume decline and 1.5% related to unfavorable price. Price was driven by discounts and mix as we begin to win back large customer business. As we finish the year, daily sales stabilized and we're beginning to see volume growth from new and existing customers. Gross profit margin increased 595 basis points over the prior-year primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies. While a sizable portion of this benefit is non-recurring, we expect some benefit will continue moving forward. SG&A dollars were 10% lower than prior-year, but the rate was unfavorable 50 basis points due to volume. Operating margin increased 545 basis points over the prior-year driven by the increase in gross margins. Now let's take a look at 2020 guidance. Consistent with last year, we will provide guidance at the beginning of the year and only plan to make updates if we expect results to fall materially outside the guided range. With that, we expect to deliver another year of solid growth for the company in 2020, as we execute upon our growth priorities and continue to support our customers. For the total company, we expect top-line growth of 3.5% to 6.5% driven by outperformance to the market in the U.S., and continued expansion of our endless assortment business. In the U.S., we expect the MRO market will remain consistent with where we exited 2019, hovering around flat to slightly negative. Even with this static market, we remain confident that our industry knowhow, deep customer relationships and scale coupled with our growth priorities position us to continue to capture share. For 2020, we expect to outgrow the broader MRO market by approximately 300 basis points. This is a step toward our stated long-term target to consistently achieve 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth each and every year. We expect to continue growing our endless assortment business at around 20% in 2020. As the MonotaRO team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add skews and leverage our 2019 investments at Zoro. From a profitability perspective, total company gross profit margin is expected to be down roughly 110 to 50 basis points in 2020. This was driven by business unit mix, with the higher growth of our lower margin endless assortment business as well as mix headwinds within our U.S. large multi-site customer subgroup as we focus on consolidating MRO spend for large corporate customers. As it relates to price, our intention is to remain market competitive while growing share and offsetting cost inflation. Having said that, price is difficult to predict given the muted and uncertain economic environment. We will stay nimble. As it relates to tariffs, our guidance assumes a status quo environment. Any changes will be evaluated if and when they occur. Total company operating margins are expected to remain consistent at the mid-point as we anticipate significant SG&A leverage as we grow the top-line while remaining prudent on costs. These top-line and profitability targets as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program are expected to produce earnings per share of $17.75 to $19.25 or 3% to 11% growth. From a quarterly timing perspective, we do anticipate that both top and bottom line performance will improve in the back half of the year as our growth priorities take hold and we lap tougher comps at the GP level in the first half. Recall that we increased prices in Q1 2019, which were subsequently dialed back in the second and third quarters. In addition, the full impact of tariff cost increases were not realized until later in 2019. Continuing with guidance on Slide 20, at a segment level we expect operating profit margins in each of our business units to remain relatively stable. In the U.S. operating margin is expected to be between 15.6% to 16% with a mid-point in line with 2019 performance. As discussed gross profit margins in the U.S. are facing headwinds primarily related to our pursuit of large customer contracts to help grow share and deepen relationships in this choppy market environment. We expect these GP headwinds will be offset by continued SG&A leverage. For other businesses, we expect 4% to 6% operating margin. After a year of significant investments in our endless assortment model and lower than expected results at Cromwell, we expect our actions in 2019 to produce improved 2020 results. As we have discussed throughout 2019, we expect operating margin at Zoro will trend favorably in 2020 and return to mid-single-digit profitability by 2021. In Canada, we expect to roughly break-even again in 2020 as revenue growth build sequentially in response to our improved service level and profitability begins to reflect our cost base reset. As noted earlier, we will lap some non-recurring supply chain efficiencies in the fourth quarter, which will be a headwind to operating margins in the New Year. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. We plan capital expenditures of about $250 million. The large majority of investment this year will center around our U.S. segment and endless assortment business in order to continue our growth in these areas. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and continue executing against our share repurchase authorization. For 2020, we're expecting between $600 million to $700 million of repurchases which continues to reflect our confidence to successfully execute our strategy and growth priorities. With that, I will turn it back to DG for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. As I look forward to 2020 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us. And I want to thank the Grainger team for their hard work and dedication. We’re well-positioned to continue to gain share in the U.S, to continue to drive 20% growth profitably in the endless assortment model, and to improve the rest of our portfolio. I’m confident in our ability to drive long-term value for all stakeholders. And I'm confident that we're going to continue to extend our lead in the industry. So with that, I will open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.
Ryan Merkel: Hey, thanks. So first-off, I'm a little surprised by the 2020 gross margin guide down about 80 basis points at the mid-point, I had thought that after the price reset, you were thinking that gross margins would start to stabilize. So I'm trying to figure out for 2020 is the big change to focus on the large accounts or what's really changing?
Tom Okray: Well, Ryan, there is really two things happening. I mean, one, it's just -- it's just the algebra of our endless assortment business unit getting much larger and growing at 20% and the gross profit profiles that that business has. So that's a very big portion of it, which is getting bigger obviously. And then one of our key growth initiatives is going after the large customers. And maybe just unpack that with a little example. Right now, we've been heavily focused on location-by-location basis. As we stated as part of our growth initiatives, we’re working more with the C-suite to try to get a broader, broader range of locations in terms of going after a bigger piece of the company's pie. And with that, initially you'll have to do some sort of write-down usually to gross margin as it relates to product mix as it relates to your offer. But then over time, there's plenty of levers to increase that gross margin whether it be with product substitution, standardization, reducing overall buy. So we're confident over time that we will improve the gross margin with those customers, but for 2020, we're being prudent in putting that in the guide.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, that makes sense. I guess for my follow-up, sort of related, I'm thinking about the long-term growth algorithm. And so maybe you can help us should we be assuming that gross margins are down sort of 50 to 60 basis points structurally because of its mix, but then you'll offset that with SG&A. So we should think about EBIT growth equaling sales growth. And then if you do better than mid-single-digits, you probably kind of do EBIT growth a little bit better. Is that right?
Donald Macpherson: So Ryan, I guess this is DG. Yes, so in the U.S. business, let's start there, our assumption is that we gained share 300 to 400 basis points faster the market. So if the market grows 2% through cycle, we'd be at 5% to 6%. At that, so what you see this coming year is a projection of market down half a percent, at that you see operating margins flat for the U.S. business year-over-year, so 2.5% growth flat operating margins. At 5% through cycle, we'd expect to get a little more leverage than the slight pressure on GP over time and see some expanding margins in the U.S. So I think it's a good -- this is a good sort of guide on the economics of the business at 2%, 2.5%, 3%, you're probably flat on operating margin in the U.S. If you get more growth than that you’re probably positive.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: Hi, good morning, everyone. First question, when I look at Slide 5, you clearly made many meaningful upgrades here. And I'm trying to figure out how many of these were defensive versus offensive in nature. And essentially, how will we measure the success of all these changes over the next three to five years? It looks like maybe a little bit of sales outgrowth. But are there other metrics, you'll be tracking to see the success of these initiatives?
Donald Macpherson: Well I think I mean these are, to be clear Dave these initiatives on the left hand side in the U.S. are mostly rearview mirror initiatives in the sense that centralizing the call centers has gotten us increased service and lower costs. So we expect to continue to get lower costs. So that's one that you'll see in the SG&A line. If I looked at our order to cash process and customer feedback in the U.S. right now it is, it is at an all-time high, it got better this year significantly relative to the competition. So some of these moves have been around continue to improve service and you see that in supply chain capacity. Verticalizing the Salesforce, we think you're going to see in terms of part contributing to that 300 to 400 basis point growth faster than the market. And so it's a mix. A lot of these have been done already. When we go forward, we're going to start talking about some of the initiatives that are on Page 7. We’re merchandising assortments. I mentioned we merchandised $1.2 billion this last year, that's far more than we've ever done in a single year and will do $1.6 billion this year. We see that directly leading to sales growth. And we measure that very tightly, marketing both effectiveness to marketing and increased marketing budget we measure that very, very tightly. We know how much that contributes to growth. But the large customer initiatives that Tom talked about, we know how much that's leading to growth and what impact that has. So we’re tracking -- we are tracking everything. We wanted to put Page 5 together to say, there's been a lot of change in the business and we feel like we're in a good position to really drive the growth initiatives we're talking about.
David Manthey: Okay, yes, that makes sense. As a follow-up, then and you partially answered this in your answer to the last question. Over the last couple of years, you clearly grow in SG&A at a rate slower than sales growth or even gross profit dollar growth. And your guidance seems to imply more of the same in line with your targets. As a distributor, there's obviously inherent inflation in some of the areas of your costs tag, can talk about the other major areas of expenses that you're keeping flat or reducing in order to keep SG&A in check so well in this lackluster environment. I'm just looking for the big two or three buckets that you think are really the drivers of that performance?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So if you look at the cost structure, and I'll focus on the U.S. again, there's some big buckets of cost, where our expectation is that we will get productivity on a consistent basis. So in our distribution centers, we continue to automate, we continue to get process improvement to drive dollars costs per line down. In our contact centers, we continue to get productivity; we continue to get productivity in our salesforce through revenue per seller increases. Our expectation is that the cost increases that you talk about will be covered by productivity in those areas. And we basically have developed a process and an expectation and a philosophy that we will continue to drive productivity in each of those areas mostly through continuous improvement to basically offset those costs increases.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Deane Dray: Hey, I just want to say appreciate your level of clarity and context in describing some of the changes here on gross margin. That's really helpful. And just to clarify in Tom's answer when you talk about the mix shift to large customers, that you'll sacrifice over the short medium term, the gross margin, but once you build share with these customers longer term, you're better positioned for profitable growth. What's the timeframe on this? I know you say longer term, but are we talking multiple years? I don't think you mean it takes that long because if you're moving to standardization, okay, so just share with us more of the timing of this because it does make sense, just the short-term, long-term seems a little vague?
Tom Okray: Yes, no first of all you've got to remember that we've got a ton of customers. So this initiative is in various stages of development by individual customers. So it's not like you snap the chalk line and you start everything at one-time. So when we're talking about short to medium-term, we're certainly talking about a lot of it will happen within 2021 timeframe. It's really building the trust embedding with the different large customers, so we can reach in mix, so we can have products, the substitution. So we can have standardization, those types of things. So I guess we would look at this as a transition year from 2020 for this initiative.
Donald Macpherson: And Deane I guess I would add to that, when we look at large customers, we track what we call economic earnings, which is a more sort of holistic view of the profitability of customers. And our goal is to make sure that we drive growth and profitable growth through that metric as opposed to just gross profit. So at times, we will take gross profit. It’s in the short-term if we're improving the cost structure elsewhere to provide the ability to consolidate customers and then provide value for those customers.
Tom Okray: I think another thing, important part to notice these are really large multi-site customers. So this is really hitting home runs versus hitting singles and doubles. So this is a very attractive business to get. And just launching off of DG’s comments, we can lever our SG&A at about 2.5% growth, so we can afford to take the time to develop these very important customers.
Deane Dray: Great. And then just a follow-up, could you put this negative price in context because we're hearing elsewhere in the industrial distributors that not only are there some of it is delays in getting supplier price increases through but there's heightened competition within the distributors, how much of that is at play in the negative price that we're seeing?
Tom Okray: I think the important thing when you talk about price is to look at it on the full-year basis. As we said in our prepared remarks, our pricing was very lumpy. You'll recall from previous calls, we were quite aggressive in Q1 and then we dialed that back in Q2 and Q3. We made a conscious decision not to raise price in the back half of the years as to not be disruptive to our customers. When you look at it on an entire basis of the full-year, our price cost was roughly neutral. So and we're happy with that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning and just kind of following up on Deane's question, is there any defensive component value pricing with the large customers? Or is that really all emanating from your tactical execution by customer just for share independent of market dynamics?
Tom Okray: I guess there's always some tactical but I would say the majority is the latter. Some of it’s product mix within a given customer, some of it’s customer specific mix.
Donald Macpherson: I guess, I guess, Chris, I think maybe your question underneath the question is has the competitive environment heightened with large customers; I think it's always been competitive. And we will always be in a situation where we have to be effective in navigating that competitive environment. It doesn't feel like it's changed dramatically, but certainly it's competitive.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then also, I think you talked about how it kind of is in -- by customer, did you suggest that this would be a 2020, 2021 process and then you might open up some gross margin headroom after 2021?
Tom Okray: It's difficult -- it's difficult enough to predict 2020 to try to predict 2021. Ideally, 2021, we would get back to a more a lesser decline in gross margin on a year-over-year basis.
Donald Macpherson: I would say, Chris, that we have a lot of confidence in the value proposition that we have, our service is exceptional. Our customers want to do business with us. Over time, we think that we should be in a position to get price as much as anybody and to be able to continue to have very strong operating margins with our customers. So we’re confident in what we’re doing. In the short-term with trade and with the environment, it's been a little bit lumpy and clearly but we're pretty confident in the long-term ability to improve our margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Baughman with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Patrick Baughman: Well thanks. Good morning, DG, good morning Tom. Maybe just start-off on the mid-size versus large customers. Just wondering into next year or I guess this year into 2020 you’d expect mid-size customers to still outpace large or is that flip with some of these share gains initiatives -- share gain initiatives you’ve been talking about for large? And then somewhat related to that you described the U.S. outgrowth in the quarter as 300 basis points and then you said large was 350 and mid-size was 550. So I'm just wondering what drag down the total segment?
Tom Okray: Sure. I’ll take the first part of the question first. Yes, definitely we would expect medium customers to grow faster than large. I guess the way we look at it is, large at about 300 bps faster than the market, mid-size about 500 bps faster than the market on the low-end. As it relates to the chart that shows large and mid-size, there's a service revenue component that is included in those charts for large and medium not to get too technical on you. But that is a very important part of our business. That is really embedding with the customer. On the U.S. segment that is reflected on a net basis meaning we adjust cost out. So that's the difference between the two numbers where you're always going to have large and medium be higher than the U.S. segment.
Patrick Baughman: Okay. I can follow-up on that after -- just one more from you, just if you could talk about the path forward at Cromwell. And what's embedded in your other businesses guidance there in terms of losses for 2020? And then on the same topic for other businesses, the magnitude of Zoro investments made in 2019. And whether do you still expect most of that spending to falloff in 2020?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So let me focus on Zoro and Cromwell, I think other than Zoro and Cromwell, we expect continued improvement in the businesses and we see a nice path. Cromwell we would expect this year to cut the losses roughly in half for this year, that’s our expectation. And I would say there's a couple of things going on at Cromwell. One is certainly the market has not been great and a portion of it has been related to that, a lot of it has been some service issues we had that we have completely worked through. We're hearing much better things from the marketplace, our net promoter score has gone from not very good to quite good actually. And the team is pretty excited about what we're doing. We have a new team over there; we're comfortable with the actions they're taking. Cromwell is interesting. If you remember why we bought Cromwell was as a platform for the online business, and because we thought it was good business. Zoro UK is actually doing quite well. And we would expect it to be profitable in 2021. So really by the end of the year, we should have a view as to whether or not both of those businesses can be successful and profitable. And that's -- that's when we will really sort of evaluate what we think we need to do. So as I mentioned beyond that in the prepared remarks, we have taken a bunch of costs out of that business. We have seen great service improvement; we have won a few contracts with customers recently. It gives us some confidence that things are coming back. But it's a steep climb get better. The investments in Zoro most -- a lot of those investments start to come-off this year. We made significant investments in the fourth quarter, some systems investments that had a few glitches, but we through them we expect improvement this year and then significant improvement again in 2021 with that business. And as I mentioned, we're excited to have Masaya Suzuki lead that business. He has been through this at the same point with MonotaRO and really feel like he's going to help that business accelerate performance going forward.
Patrick Baughman: Thanks a lot.
Tom Okray: So there is no reason we can't see the margin profile longer-term for Zoro be consistent with MonotaRO.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research Company. Please state your question.
Adam Uhlman: Hey guys, good morning. Hey Tom, I guess could you expand a little bit more about your comments earlier about the cadence of earnings to the year, I'm just wondering the fourth quarter costs for Zoro were higher than expected, does that carry into the first quarter here as things are ironed out and then are those the moving pieces we should keep in mind like the customer show other investment spending for Louisville, I'm just trying to get a sense of, should we be bracing for larger earnings designs in the first quarter and then into the second and then recovery in the second half of the year?
Tom Okray: We are talking specifically about SG&A I'll go back to DG’s answer on Zoro. 2019 was an investment year for Zoro where we spent heavily in SG&A related to adding people, technology and advertising that will be reduced significantly beginning in -- beginning in Q1, so that will be a material impact. The way I would think about SG&A is the way we've talked about it, we plan on growing SG&A at half the rate of sales. We will continue with the productivity that DG talked about in a previous answer. As it relates to gross profit, we’ve seen no difference than our normal seasonality. We expect Q1 to be greater -- greater gross margin than Q4 of this year. And then we expect it to decline throughout the year with Q4 being a relative uptick to Q3. Does that get answer to your question?
Adam Uhlman: Yes, that helps. And then secondly, could you expand a little bit more about what you guys are seeing in the near-term from a customer spending and general environment perspective, it looked like most of the end-market, or the sales growth by end-market was relatively similar to last quarter, I guess today things stand out to you as notable and then as we think about the investments that are being made into the Salesforce and verticalization efforts from this past year, are there any vertical markets that we should look to see accelerating growth next year as evidence of a payoff on those investments?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, Adam, so what I would say is that, we are privileged to see a very wide swath of the economy with our customers. We have not seen much, much change over the last eight months really; I would say we continue to see a market that is slow growth, but not trailing off in anything worse at this point. And the customer end market results that we've seen the last two quarters, our expectation is they won't be dissimilar to start the year and that they're likely to get a little better as the year goes along. That would be our expectation at this point, not much better, a little bit better as you're going along. So I don't -- we don't see anything all that is unusual in our end markets right now, we haven’t over the last couple of quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please state your question.
Chris Dankert: Just one question from me, thanks so much for the update on large customer prototypes swinging for the fences on volume there. I guess could you get a brief update on kind of medium customer strategy there's still some concern about this being more price competitive pieces of business just how are you balancing digital versus high-touch and what is the go-to-market look like in medium customer in 2020 here?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, so midsize customers are actually less price sensitive and we continue to see much higher margins with midsize customers. We're trying to build -- build a growth so that can become a more meaningful portion of our portfolio. We continue to see the ability into the Grainger brand to acquire new customers. We continue to see growth with our existing customers through our inside sales team, and through fairly simple pricing actions. Our service model really sings things to midsize customers. We continue to get very loyal customers in through the funnel. We're digital first in the sense that most of our midsize customer acquisition comes through digital first touch. And then we do a lot of work to understand who the customer is, what their profile is and move them through the cycle in some cases to get them to coverage that makes sense for them. That has proven to be fairly successful. As Tom said, we expect it to go faster with midsize customers at higher gross profit than we will have with large.
Chris Dankert: Yes got it. Just one sort of follow-up on that. I mean the 400 to 500 basis points above market in medium customer, anything that helps kind of get our arms around what informs that or why that's kind of sustainable longer-term?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I think the most obvious is we lost a lot of that business. If you remember we were kind of $1.6 billion in that business went down to 800 something million and now we're up over a $1 billion again. There's a lot of customers that we continue to reengage and a lot of our marketing efforts are proving to be very successful with these customers. And once we get customers back and they realize that we are not -- that we're reasonably priced, very high service solution, they are coming back and working with Grainger again.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please state your question.
Karen Lau: Hi, good morning. It is Karen Lau dialing in for John. Thanks for taking the question. So DG I think in the past few years, you had mentioned that given after the price reset, pricing pressure from large accounts has kind of diminished because your prices are more competitive. It sounded like that is really changing a little bit into 2020. I wasn't obviously there's the defense versus offense components, but the whole thing sound a little reminiscent of what happened before you do the pricing reset. So my question is, can you compare the customer's behavior today versus how they were three years ago and then compare your ability to respond to that versus three years ago before the pricing reset?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So I mean I don't think -- I don't think the situations are at all now, I guess back then, we were losing share dramatically with higher margin customers. We’re not doing that now. Large customer business even back then was very competitive. Most of it was on custom pricing contracts that is still the same today. The large customer pricing -- the advantage we got through the price change was that some of the tailspin was easier to get large customers to sign-up for because they weren't buying things frequently then our prices then made sense that is still the case. We have super pricing discussions with our customers now. They are still competitive. They were competitive back then, they're still competitive now.
Karen Lau: Okay. Maybe looking at it as sort of a different angle. So mid-size obviously has been a focus in the past two years and has been very successful for you guys. I guess the shift to large accounts and I guess the factor that’s kind of deemphasizing midsize account a little bit, is it just a function of you have been very successful and done what you could do with those accounts. So, it's hard to do more to further accelerate the outgrowth in that market. I mean how you are thinking about that?
Donald Macpherson: I would say we are not deemphasizing midsize customers at all. We still think they will grow faster than large. We are making sure that we’re competitive with our large customers. And that's important, obviously given the size of that customer group for us. That is a bigger lever on growth at this point. And so we need to make sure that we are growing with both but we are not deemphasizing anything. We still think there's a long runway ahead from midsize customer.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research. Please state your question.
Robert Barry: I’m hearing from East Coast. Yes just a few follow-ups actually. Yes, it looks like prices assume neutral in the guide. Is that right?
Tom Okray: Yes, basically we're looking at price cost to be relatively neutral. As we said in the prepared remarks, we've got the three variables that we're trying to balance, share growth, market competitiveness in terms of pricing, as well as passing on inflationary cost. And similar to this year, we're going to balance those, those three and we think we'll end up somewhere flattish from a price cost perspective.
Robert Barry: Got it. And I think when you first did the price reset, the goal was to narrow what had become a very large premiums market but still maintain some modest premium to go-to-market as the premium provider and to price that way, is that still true? Or it almost sounds like kind of alluding to the earlier question that maybe you're getting a little more aggressive, more happy to err actually on the side of under versus overpricing the market.
Donald Macpherson: Now, we still have a premium with our list prices, we will continue to do that. It's a modest premium. And we'll continue to have that. And then I think the comment earlier was when you're going after large contracts on a portion of volume; you need to get pretty aggressive. And we've always done that. We just have to continue that.
Tom Okray: Yes, I think you're making too much about price as it relates to large customers versus just a normal business dynamic where you're going from individual locations to a much bigger piece of a total company. That's just -- there's going to be part of as DG says that you're going to have a certain part of the offer that's going to be priced aggressively to get your foot in the door.
Robert Barry: Got it. And just lastly, Tom, on the gross margin cadence through the year I understand in absolute terms higher in 1Q and then down through the year but had you alluded earlier to the year-over-year decline in gross margin being larger in 1Q and then moderating as the year progressed, or did I mishear that?
Tom Okray: Yes, no, no, you heard it correctly. The front half of the year is definitely going to be a larger year-over-year decline than the back half. And that just is a lapping consideration where again, we were heavy on price at the beginning of the year in 2019. Costs didn't kick in until the back half of the year. So yes, that's the correct way to model.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please state your question.
Mario Cortellacci: Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. I know you guys already touched on the Zoro business and the new roll-off of the investments. I’m just curious, I guess as margins build in that business, do you think that you'll break out Zoro and MonotaRO as a separate segment? I mean some could argue that your multiple doesn't really represent that business at all given where other online marketplace assets trade at?
Donald Macpherson: What I would say is that with Masaya now running this, we think we have a couple of years of really hard work to make sure that we are performing on a path like the MonotaRO businesses then in the U.S. and in the UK. That's our entire attention. We are fully aware of the question and but for right now, we're really focused on making sure we get the businesses to be as successful as possible.
Tom Okray: And as it relates to reportable segments obviously will follow all SEC regulations in terms of doing that.
Mario Cortellacci: Got it. Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. I think your working capital has been a cash flow drag in 2018 and 2019. I just want to know what your assumptions were for 2020 and maybe just a little color on the reason for the headwinds, is it mostly the endless assortment portion?
Tom Okray: No, no. You rightly point out that it has been a little bit of a drag in 2018 and 2019. I would be disappointed if it didn't become more of a tailwind in 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.
Michael McGinn: Thanks. If I could lean in on the Zoro and MonotaRO discussion as your model continues to shift more towards a reseller base. What does the business look like today in terms of sourcing and along those lines, what kind of ballpark services are you targeting relative to similar BDC, e-commerce peers, is it something similar like Alibaba in Europe around mid-single-digits or higher something like Amazon is charging?
Donald Macpherson: I'm sorry could you, I'm not sure I fully understand the question. So let me just tell you what we're doing and maybe that will help you help answer it. We are not creating a marketplace Ali Baba or Amazon, we actually will have supplier relationships that we have some of them direct ship to customers from Zoro, that's what we've done on MonotaRO. And so the GPs tend to be slightly less there but not dramatically less when you do that because we don't have big package ship, but it's not like it's a fee and that's all we're getting. So I think it's a different model describing.
Tom Okray: Yes, it is going to be a win-win for the suppliers that are drop shipping and certainly for us.
Michael McGinn: Okay, asked it different way, is MonotaRO currently getting a service fee from Zoro and does that go up over time as the business expands?
Tom Okray: Okay, that's a different question, sorry. Yes, there is a variable service fee that Zoro does pay to MonotaRO and it's based on their profitability.
Michael McGinn: Sorry is it based on Zoro’s profitability?
Tom Okray: Yes.
Michael McGinn: Okay. And what is that currently and what do you expect that to trend to as you build to 10 million skews?
Tom Okray: Yes, not going to go into those types of details.
Donald Macpherson: They'll get bigger, as they're successful, it will get bigger in space. It’s very small, it's a very small portion.
Tom Okray: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please state your question.
Justin Bergner: Two quick ones here most have been answered. With respect to the Canadian gross margin improvement, is that sustainable or was there anything sort of one-time that benefited the fourth quarter?
Tom Okray: Yes, as we said in our prepared remarks, some of that was win dated related to supply chain efficiencies. I guess if I were to score it roughly, I'd say half of it will continue, half of it will fall-off.
Justin Bergner: Okay, that's helpful. And then the retail customer segment improved dramatically in the quarter I guess, to mid-teens growth. Just curious if that sort of idiosyncratic or if there's initiatives there some underlying backdrop is favorable?
Donald Macpherson: Just to be clear, retail for us typically does not mean retail stores; it means warehouses attached to retail. And as you would guess that has continued to be a growing business in the U.S. as more stuff shows up at your door. So that's what's driving that growth. That is a growing thing.
Donald Macpherson: All right, thanks. I appreciate everybody being on the call. I would just reiterate we are really confident in our path. We feel good about sharing profitability in the U.S. We feel really good about the online model excited to have Masaya lead that and drive strong growth and profitability there. And we will get Canada and Cromwell right. But generally, I would say we're very excited about where we're going and appreciate you listening to call today. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q3 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q3 press release, both of which are available on the IR Web site. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results and now I will turn it over to DG.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks Irene. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to discuss our Q3 results and ensure an update on the U.S. and MS assortment growth initiatives that we introduced earlier this year. Then, Tom will provide details on the quarter and will open it up for questions. We have solid result so far this year as we managed through the uncertainty of the current environment. Despite soften global demand, we have accelerated our sequential share gain in the U.S. business and continued to invest for growth in our MS assortment business Zoro. We have also been diligent in partnering with our suppliers to manage cost and difference expense leverage across our U.S. and Canadian businesses. Year-to-date total company operating margin is up 30 basis points and we driven incremental margins of 26%. We have also maintained the guidance that we set on the Q4 call on January for total company total gross profit margin, operating margin and earnings per share. I want to commend our team members for all the work they done to strive during this environment. From our recent U.S. customer visit, clear that demand has slowed but it's also through the things are not falling off the cliff. And we have great opportunities to continue to gain share. Earlier this month, I spend time with the large manufacturer in the Southeast. They have seen strong growth due to their ability to innovate. Our team members have built solid relationships with their leadership and operation staff and are delivering solution that matter. This customer view Grainger has providing exceptional service as part of their operation. We have leveraged our key stock inventory management system to make easy for this customer to have what they need when they needed. We will have a portion of this customer spend today because of our reliable partnership and our ability to deliver real value; we are exploring ways to expand our offer. This means finding ways for this customer to save more money by ensuring that they are using the right products at the right cost and managing usage and inventory effectively. When we do these things well we gain share. I rarely visit a customer with the opportunity to create value and gain share is not significant. And we do this across our business through two models. Through out high tech solutions model, we provide relevant products and services to customers to drive efficiencies and to save their money. Through our endless assortment model, we provide value through an expansive assortment that is easily accessed to streamline search experience. In these challenging times, we continue to focus on what matters. We are investing for growth in both business models. Our strong balance sheet allows us to invest in good times and bad. And we are rigorous in our expense management. We have already achieved roughly $200 million in savings in the last two years and have expectations for continued productivity moving forward. With that, let's take a closer look at our performance in the U.S. in Q3. Similar to what we are seeing from economic indicators, we estimate that U.S. market growth accelerated from approximately 2% to 2.5% Q1 and approximately 1% in Q2 to about flat in Q3. We are seeing softness across most end markets including heavy manufacturing, natural resources, contractors and in pockets like manufacturing. We have seen some of our customers particular with heavy manufacturing and natural resources slow production. Healthcare market remains quite strong and we are seeing flat to modest growth in government and retail end markets. U.S. segment share gain accelerated sequentially in the third quarter by 250 basis points of out growth versus the market. U.S. large business grew 2% and 10% on a two year stack and U.S. midsize grew 5% and 23% on a two year stack. Let me spend a few minutes providing an update on our U.S. growth initiatives which we introduced in May of this year. As previously communicated, these initiatives fall under two buckets. First, our improvements to our foundation that ensure that we stay competitive, this includes improving the quality of our product and customer data, embedding our keep stock offer and enhancing the customer experience. Second bucket of initiatives are incremental investments that contribute to our long-term goal of 300 to 400 basis points of growth above market. Our initiatives are beginning to take hold as evidenced by 250 basis points of share gain in the quarter. Our merchandising efforts are showing strong incremental revenue lift driven by our comprehensive category review process. About $0.5 billion of product revenue has been remerchandised and we're seeing good results. We expect to get through about $1 billion for our assortment by year end. We made incremental marketing investments in the third quarter and our return on these investments has steadily improved throughout the year, which has exceeded our expectations. We have made solid progress in improving the customer experience and have increased the effectiveness of our order to cash process since the beginning of this year. Our customer feedback suggests that we provide the best experience in our space. We have re-energized our corporate account work and have seen improvements in share gain with this group of customers. Finally, we are on track to start receiving inbound shipments to our Louisville DC in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by our ability to accelerate sequential share gain in the U.S. and we remain fully committed to 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth versus the market on an ongoing basis. I also want to spend a few minutes on our growth initiatives at Zoro U.S. You've heard us talk about expanding the product assortment of Zoro. Our goal is to add 10 million items over the next three to five years. In the third quarter we added about 350,000 SKUs, which brings us to 800,000 SKUs for the year. These product adds are driving incremental revenue growth on a first new basis that is similar to what we've seen historically at MonotaRO. Our investment in systems and people to help drive this growth are also going well. We launched a new marketing campaign in September and the results are promising, although early. We are optimistic about the trajectory of Zoro going forward; the bulk of our investments in this business will be completed by the end of this year. And we expect strong growth and profitability moving forward. Now, the natural tendency would be to cut back on these types of investments during a soft market. While we are focused on long-term growth of our business and we'll continue to make prudent investments while driving productivity. Now I'll turn it over to Tom who will discuss the quarter's results in more detail.
Thomas Okray: Thanks DG. Looking at our total company adjusted results for the quarter daily sales were up 2.5%, volume grew 2.5% and both price and the impact of FX were flat to the prior year. Two of our businesses, AGI and Cromwell are not only facing challenging end markets but are also in the middle of turnarounds. Their results are adversely impacting the company's performance. For perspective the U S segment and endless assortment. businesses combined were up 4.5% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date versus the prior year. Moving to gross profit. Our total company gross profit margin declined 80 basis points versus the prior year. The decline in gross profit margin was driven primarily by the timing of U.S. price adjustments during the year, which resulted in negative price cost spread in the U.S in the third quarter. Lower gross profit margin of our endless assortment businesses also contributed to the decline. Year-to-date, our total company gross profit margin is down 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the fourth quarter, we expect the company's gross profit margin to be higher than the third quarter. We drove operating earnings growth of 2% in the quarter. Our operating margin, however, declined 20 basis points versus the prior year due primarily to the investments we're making to drive growth at Zoro. Excluding the investments in Zoro, SG&A leverage completely offset the gross profit margin decline in the quarter. As expected, SG&A grew at half the rate of sales. As an organization, we will continue to rigorously manage expenses while ensuring we're providing the absolute best experience for our customers. Year-to-date, operating margin has expanded 30 basis points and we've driven incremental margin of 26%. We were also focused on generating strong cash flow while operating cash flow in the quarter decreased 8% driven primarily by unfavorable timing of supplier payments, operating cash flow was up 3.5% year-to-date and close to a 100% of reported net income. Year-to-date, we've returned $842 million to shareholders through $242 million in dividends and $600 million in share buybacks. We expect to continue to buyback shares in the fourth quarter. Now, let's turn to our performance in the U.S. The demand environment has slowed throughout the year and the market was flat in the third quarter. Daily sales were up 2.5% comprised of volume growth of 2.5%, flat price inflation, 0.5% increase of inter company sales to Zoro and a 0.5% decline in specialty brands. In the quarter, we grew 250 basis points faster than the market driven by strong execution of our U.S. growth initiative. U.S. gross profit margin declined 80 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year driven primarily by product cost inflation outpacing price inflation partially offset by favorability and supply chain. At the beginning of 2019, we wanted to ensure that our pricing was sufficient to cover product cost increases related to tariffs and general inflation. In retrospect, we were a little too aggressive. To ensure that our pricing was market-based, we dialed pricing back in the second quarter, while third quarter gross profit margin was a little below our expectations, we estimate that gross profit margin will be higher in the fourth quarter and the third quarter and the results for the entire year will be consistent with the expectations set at the start of the year. In an environment with uncertainty around tariffs and market demand, quarterly noise is common place. Year-to-date picture is often more useful on the evaluating performance. More perspective on a year-to-date basis excluding the write down of remaining contract negotiations, our price cost spread is favorable. Further, we continue to effectively manage product cost inflation related to both tariffs and general inflation. In the quarter both improved sequentially and we expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter. U.S operating earnings increased 4% in the quarter, U S operating margin was flat versus the prior year as lower gross profit margin was completely offset by SG&A leverage. SG&A was flat on sales growth of 4%. In Canada, daily sales declined 14.5% on a constant currency basis. Price inflation was 1% in the quarter and volume declined 15.5%. Volume remains the main issue in Canada. While optimization of the cost structure is strong, it's taking time for us to stabilize top-line performance. Operating margin was positive in the third quarter for the first time in 2019 driven by improvement to gross profit margin and continued diligence on the SG&A line. Gross profit margin improved 50 basis points versus the prior year largely due to supply chain efficiencies, offsetting negative price cost spread. Moving to other businesses, which includes our endless assortment model and our international portfolio. Daily sales were up 9% in the third quarter on a constant currency basis due to revenue growth from our endless assortment model. Together MonotaRO and Zoro daily sales grew 19.5% in the quarter. Gross profit margin for the other businesses declined 130 basis points driven by promotional activities at Zoro and freight headwinds at both Zora and MonotaRO. Operating margin declined 220 basis points for the other businesses, primarily driven by long-term growth investments in Zoro U.S. and performance at Cromwell. As we've mentioned in the past, the Cromwell business is facing operational challenges while also experiencing a difficult economic climate. The business is taking action to improve service and the customer experience to drive top-line growth while also improving the cost structure. Page 14 covers our guidance for 2019. At the total company level, we are reiterating all of our guided metrics. At the segment level, we expect the U.S. segment and other businesses to be within their guided ranges. For AGI, we now expect to finish the year below the guided range. Now I'll turn it back to DG for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks Tom. Our performance so far this year has been solid even in a slower growth environment and with the added uncertainty around tariffs. While AGI and Cromwell continue to be challenged, customer feedback is much better in both businesses. We have done a lot of work to get the cost structure and service right in AGI and Cromwell and are well positioned to grow in the future. I was at Cromwell earlier this month and even with the economic challenges customers were pleased with our improved service, we are exploring how to expand these relationships. We are happy with the growth of our endless assortment businesses and the progress we're seeing with our U.S. growth initiatives. We have driven strong incremental margin year-to-date and are maintaining our total company guidance. We are committed to delivering strong performance over the short-term and long-term. Our performance expectations remain the following; we expect our initiatives in the U.S. to drive 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth versus the market on an ongoing basis. We believe Canada is an attractive market for Grainger and we will continue our work to drive profitable growth in that business. We expect to accelerate growth with our endless assortment model through the strength of MonotaRO in Japan and the investments we're making in Zor0 U.S. Overall, we expected our strong SG&A leverage and operating margin improvement for the year, resulting in incremental margin of 20% to 25%. Now, we'll open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Manthey from Baird. Your line is now live.
David Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. You mentioned the long-term goal of growing SG&A at half the rate of sales growth and you've obviously done a great job over the past several years. And clearly that equation is lot easier when you're growing 8% than when you're growing 2%, but you've actually done it in both environments. What I'm wondering is, as we go forward here -- we're looking ahead to the next year or so. Do you have a specific plan in place that'll keep that expense leverage going or at some point that we just see natural low single digit inflation returned to the cost stack in any case?
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Dave. I would say that we are constantly working on improving our expenses and our cost structure. We have a built in an expectation that the functions and the business will cover things like merit going forward. And we're working through plans for next year right now as you might guess. But, we feel pretty confident that we can continue to get cost productivity throughout the business and we'll work hard to make sure that we continue to deliver the performance we've been delivering.
David Manthey: Okay. Thanks. And then, DG, when you said that you expect a return to strong profitability in the endless assortment business or something along those lines that improved profitability. I'm just wondering if you can help us define that. Historically when you look at segment contribution margins, following periods of investment you've gotten as high as maybe the mid or higher teens, is that what we should be thinking about for contribution margins in the other business segment going forward?
Donald Macpherson: I would say that if you look at the online businesses, which are part of the other segment. Our expectation is we will return Zoro to profitability and we'll begin the migration over the next several years up to very strong profitability that we see in MonotaRO. And I think, the MonotaRO P&L give you a sense for where we hope to be able to get with the Zoro business. So that's our objective and it'll take several years to get there as we come out of these investments. But we're pretty confident we can continue to grow profits.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Merkel from Williams Blair. Your line is now alive.
Ryan Merkel: Hey, thanks. Couple of questions. So, first, I just want to clarify why gross margins are going to improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. I apologize if I missed it.
Thomas Okray: Yes. Gross margins typically improve sequentially Q3 versus Q4 this year. Q4 versus Q3, they typically will improve. And this quarter is going to be no different going into Q4. We are seeing general inflation and tariff inflation going down and that's the main driver for gross profit going up in Q4.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay. And then, you mentioned a price adjustment in the second quarter. Can you just tell us how much did you lower prices maybe on average, and was it broad based across all the SKUs or was it more targeted?
Thomas Okray: It was more targeted. And obviously, we're working on this on a continuous basis. As we said in the prepared remarks, coming up to Q1, we thought we overshot a little bit. So, we went back and really scrubbed. Some SKUs, we raised, some SKUs we lowered overall though we lowered.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
Thomas Okray: One other comment related to the first question on gross margin, we also expect some favorability in supply chain to help us out related to Q4. We see softening in the supply chain area, the transportation area. We expect that to also be a factor in Q4.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Christopher Glynn: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon out there. So, a lot of emphasis on the 300 to 400 basis points of long-term sustainable outgrowth. I wanted to narrow that down into medium, get a little more detail on traction on your initiatives and prospect to kind of inflect that growth higher. I think last quarter you talked about things like assortment, sales coverage and digital experience. So, wondering how you're seeing those kind of discreet drivers kind of ramp on the ground level.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Thanks Chris. We continue to expect our midsize customer growth and share gain to be higher than the overall U.S. share gain. We continue to see that. We certainly given the way we cover and interact with customers, things like merchandising and marketing have an outsized impact. They impact all of our customers, but they have an outsized impact on the midsize customers and that has continued to play out. And our expectation is that we will continue to grow significantly faster in the next several years with midsize customers than with the whole. And the initiatives are playing out pretty much as expected at this point.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then, with Canada, just want to, I think you talked a little bit more about sales stabilization and prior quarters. Just wondering where's the cross section between the customer re-engagement you've talked about with stabilized service levels versus kind of softening macro up above?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I'd say that. We have a number of our sales leaders in and we interact with them frequently and I've been talking to them and I've been in hearing from customer feedback. We are now having conversations and getting permission to grow with our customers. And that's -- it's been several years, frankly, since that's been the case. And so, we are right at the -- it feels like we're right at the precipice now of being able to start climbing again and grow based on the work we've done. And it's been a long haul, but we feel like we're having the right conversations now. So we're a lot more confident now than we've been in several years.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now alive.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey, I know you're not in the giving of 2020 guidance yet, but just could you talk qualitatively what you're expecting the U.S. MRO market to look like? One of the other big industrial distributors talked about a flattish expectations for the first half. How do you think the operating environment for MRO will be? And then, related to that, what caused you to step up into that 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth and what might the timeframe be for that? So, two part question. Thanks.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks Deane. So I think, we don't have any crystal ball that's different than others we're seeing. We are planning for a wide range of potential market growth outcomes for next year and building plans around a wide range. I think flattish is not a bad place to start probably and anybody's guess, but that would not be a certainly a wrong estimate at this point. But we are planning for a fairly wide range. We actually are -- we have a set of initiatives that we've talked about that we believe are starting to build by getting us to that 300 to 400 basis points. If you look at the quarter on a volume basis, we were significantly higher than 300 basis points of growth actually. So we are starting to get confident that we have the right initiatives in place to grow 300 or 400 basis points. And then, things we've been talking about with merchandising, marketing, adding sellers, corporate account growth, reenergizing things like [indiscernible] program. So, we feel like they've got the right initiatives and we're starting to get some of that traction right now.
Deane Dray: Terrific. And just as a follow up, is there any update on gamut? Looks like that website is in transition. You talked a bit about how that might be happening. And then maybe some update on the improvement of the search capability in the rollout there. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Gamut is no longer a customer facing website. All those learnings have been built into the Grainger processes. We're building a new product information system that will be live in the fourth quarter. We've actually -- when we talk about remerchandising $0.5 billion so far this year, a lot of the insights from gamut are actually in those remerchandising. So if you look at the categories that we've gone through, you see a lot of the lessons there. So we have effectively built what we've learned from gamut into grainger.com, we're getting -- continued to get improved feedback from customers and that will only get better and better as we continue to build out more categories and improve the product information. So we're pretty excited about the path we're on in terms of our search experience right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Barry from Buckingham Research. Your line is now alive.
Robert Barry: Hey everyone. Good morning. Just a quick follow up on Ryan's question. I think Tom, you mentioned seeing inflation going down. Was that just a comment on freight or is that broader?
Thomas Okray: I mean, sequentially, if you look at what we've experienced in Q3 versus Q2, we saw both tariff related inflation and general inflation go down. We expect that to continue in Q4 as well.
Robert Barry: Okay. So, do you expect to be priced cost positive in 4Q?
Thomas Okray: Didn't say that. We'll come back to what we said for the entire year. We expect to be price cost neutral excluding our pricing rate downs that we've done.
Robert Barry: Got it. It just seems a little counterintuitive because the tariff headwinds seemed to be growing. 
Thomas Okray: Actually, if you look at the tariffs, how we've experienced them throughout the year, they've been fairly constant. And now that we're starting to lap some of the tariffs, we're seeing improvement there. The other thing is you have to reconcile between stated tariffs and what we're actually able to negotiate in terms of realized tariff. And we've got two buckets we work on. One is our own imported parts which come from largely from China, which are impacted directly. And the other ones are national brands, which we work with our supplier partners. So stated versus actually realized is a factor as well.
Robert Barry: Got it. And so just lastly, so does that mean in that context, maybe seeing price at zero is less of a concern to you given you been able to negotiate some of this deflation?
Thomas Okray: Well, I think what I would say is, where we're at in terms of our share growth where we're at in terms of our share growth objectives and our share growth initiative, seeing flat pricing for the quarter doesn't get us overly exercised as DG mentioned from a volume basis. We grew share quite a bit and at this point where we're trying to get traction on our share gain initiative that doesn't concern us at one quarter we're priced flat. If you look at the entire year, we're price cost neutral when you adjust for the reset from the strategic write down. And we're happy with that. It's what our objective was at the beginning of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Pokrzwinksi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Hi. Good morning guys.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Just want to follow up. Given that we're now past -- kind of fully passed the price reset, just any observation with some of those customers what percentage of kind of converted to being more core customers versus those were maybe transactional during the process. So imagine you've got a better grasp on that today than maybe you did six or 12 months ago. How satisfied are you with that? And, I guess, hopefully that is the first question.
Donald Macpherson: So Josh, let me, I will answer the question and interpret it. So, tell me if I'm not answering correctly. We tend to look at with our large customers for sure. We had a lot of relationships that were not transactional relationships before. We still have a lot of those and we've expanded some of those. I think the biggest shift has been with mid sized customers where we now have a whole lot more midsize customers that are buying frequently. Based on the price reset and the price reset was largely to make sure that we were growing across the entire customer base consistently. And so we have liked the results we see with the test customers. You still have a long way to go to acquire and turn those -- many of those customers into regular purchasing customers. But we have made great progress with midsize customers.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Got it. Yeah, that was a midsize customer question, so yeah, definitely
Donald Macpherson: Sure.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Right. Yes. Well, large wouldn't make much sense. And then, I guess on the price cost dynamic from here, is there anything that happens as a function of the calendar in terms of customers kind of reevaluating the start a year where the progression kind of post 4Q inflex or diflex one way or another? I think from a cost perspective, there's probably equal measures deflation and inflation, but probably, a bit more deflation on the inputs. But just trying to understand how that conversation evolves over time on the pricing front and if there's anything that changes with the calendar?
Donald Macpherson: Well, we have a long history of working with our customers to -- a lot of our contract customers to lock in prices at the beginning of the year. So, we got through a process that we are going through now to make sure we've got the right competitive prices and that process always happens. So, there's always a sort of beginning of the year sort of reset that happens and you see that in our results historically that that will be the same this year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today coming from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live.
Karen Lau: Hi. Good morning. It's Karen Lau dialing in for John. So, I just want to clarify on the 3Q gross margins dynamic. It sounded like given you said price inflation has differentially come down essentially all of that gross margin degradation is coming from product pricing. I guess part of it maybe you can confirm that the 5% of large accounts that still needs to get price adjusted and is that done over the quarter. And then is the rest of the pricing degradation coming from more broad based pricing adjustments?
Thomas Okray: Yes. It's largely, done, we'll see a little bit in Q4 and then we won't have any in 2020.
Karen Lau: Okay. Yes. It just sounds like I guess given the magnitude of the pricing and gross margin decreased more of that has to do with broader based pricing adjustment. Maybe just follow up on that point. I guess you guys have adjusted pricing since the start of the year, I guess a couple of times. As you go through this exercise, are you seeing sequentially similar, well I guess the ideal volume response that you would hope for or are we -- as you go through, like these pricing exercise, are you starting to see throughout the year like bit of a more diminishing returns.
Thomas Okray: No, I, I think we're seeing good pricing response. Again, I'll go back to -- we see a flat MRO market in the third quarter included in that flat market is a little over 1% in price offset, little bit over 1% in volume deterioration. We were up 2.5%. So that puts us, well above 350 bps. There's also some weather issues related to the hurricanes last year that we didn't put in our prepared remarks and some government lapping differences. So yes, if you look at that, we're very happy with our volume response.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I would just add that, if you think about some of the pricing dynamic, Tom talked about this. We talked about being priced cost neutral before the reset for the year. We are effectively where we expect to be in aggregate. And we are careful, we made pricing changes all the time, but we're very careful not to disrupt customers with large customers, particularly, we are changing prices around. So, we are a little bit more careful with how many times will change with large customers, but overall we've seen the exact response we expected this year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now live.
Adam Uhlman: Hey, good morning guys. Had a few questions on Zoro. When should we expect incremental investment spend to wrap up? Are we fully lapping that as we head into the first quarter and should expect profitability to recover there early in the year, is going to take a little bit more time.
Thomas Okray: Yes, so we expect that, we expect profitability just to recover some in the first quarter. We did start investing pretty heavily in the first quarter of this year. And it'll just grow -- from profitability to grow from there. So, we will get some improvement in the first quarter's augmentation.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. And then, the 800,000 SKUs that have been added so far this year. And as we add some more going forward, I'm just wondering if you could comment about, if the gross margin profile of the business is changing. How you look at the categories that you're adding in? Is that more of a build out of the existing one or are there new product categories that are getting you into higher or lower margin categories?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I think that we are -- first of all, we're adding a whole bunch of categories that we haven't had before. So there's a mix of that in new categories and expanding the operating just in categories. In general, we are creating a fairly distinct value proposition for Zoro and Zoro will become less relied on the Grainger supply chain moving forward. And so, most of those products will be drop shipped. So for the financials, the GP is lower when you have drop shipped items. So, was the expense. But, you'll see that impact to GP slightly over time. And, but we expect most of those items that we're adding, if we talk about 10 million over the next three to five years, we expect most of those items to be third-party ship. We're going to be stocking most of those in Grainger.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Dankert from Longbow Research. Your line is now live.
Chris Dankert: All right. Thanks for taking my question. You guys have given some really great color on gross margin. I guess kind of moving down to SG&A, typically we see a bit of a step up into the fourth quarter here, but your reiteration of the guidance suggests maybe you can hold that flat of the fourth quarter. Is that the right way to be thinking about SG&A and just maybe some -- you can have it on the puts and takes that are in that line?
Thomas Okray: Yes. I think just thinking about it the right way. Year-to-date, we're on a total company level where we're 70 bps favorable for SG&A. We expect that percentage to increase for the entire year. We do have a favorable lap related to variable compensation in addition to just a number of other cost productivity ideas and implementation that'll hit in Q4.
Chris Dankert: Got it. Got. Thank you. And then thinking about, some of the rollback of the investment in the other business in Zoro and MonotaRO. I think you guys had called out rolling back the vast majority of that in 2020. Is that still the plan?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. That's still the plan, Chris. That is, if you think about it, a number of the investments have been system investments. So, we're going live with the new product information system for example, we get through those this year and those do not repeat next year. So, we have most of the investments behind us. We have added people analytics talent, marketing talent that will remain obviously but a lot of the investments are kind of one-timers if they're going to be gone this year.
Thomas Okray: And as you saw in the charts, we're really happy with the sales growth of both Zoro and MonotaRO. MonotaRO constant currency, local currency basis was up over 23% and Zoro was up big double digits. So, very happy with that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Justin Bergner from G. Research. Your line is now live.
Justin Bergner: Good morning, DJ. Good morning Tom. Just quickly on Zoro, did I hear you say earlier in the call that Zoro is currently running unprofitable below breakeven?
Donald Macpherson: No. They actually made money in the quarter just not as much as they will make on a ongoing run rate basis.
Justin Bergner: Okay. And does any of the investment -- price investment or is this all mainly on the SG&A side?
Donald Macpherson: It's both. There are promotional spending, which we're undertaking when are adding new SkUs and going into new verticals.
Donald Macpherson: Okay. On a dollar bases most of it is expense as opposed to price of that.
Justin Bergner: Okay, great. My other question was just around the -- I guess price action you took that affected price cost in the third quarter. Was that price action taken in the second quarter such that you kind of expected the results that you ended up just reporting or was some of that taken in the third quarter? And was that all sort of to correct for some of the pricing you took in the earlier part of the year? It was some of that more in response to current market conditions.
Donald Macpherson: It's taken in the second quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.
Nigel Coe: Yes. Good morning. Why don't you just come back from the gross margin sequential guidance he gave and certainly, when you go back in history, there's a very profound seasonal uplift in 4Q. Can you remind us though what drives that? Is it a mixed impact? Because normally revenues are slightly down. So, just curious what drives that. And then, the second part of that question is with the task list three 25% rolled in from may onwards and then that's from September, I think you talked about 10% of your U S sales industry [indiscernible] school. I'm just curious why we're not incrementally shrink pressures come from prep and preps are set by other deflation meeting text. But maybe just address that as well, please.
Thomas Okray: Okay. Well, let me take the first one and I might have to get you to repeat the second one where it was, it was breaking up on our phone here. There are many levers that we can pull in terms of, in terms of gross margin for Q4, why is it historically goes up. Traditionally I think what we've seen is, we've seen cost inflation work its way, work its way down throughout the year, and we have better opportunities in terms of related to pricing terms in terms of vendor rebates, customer support, those types of things, which are quarter-end settlements. And we count those as costs, obviously. Our pricing environment is fairly static throughout the year as DG mentioned with the, the big pricing happening throughout the year. So the main driver in Q4 is really our vendor volume rebates and our customer rebates settlements that we have in Q4.
Donald Macpherson: And if I can get you to, repeat the second question, please.
Thomas Okray: Yeah, I'm, it's pretty just about the impact of the tariff. So the step up from 10% to 25% on the list, three tariffs which would it early May. And then, I think previously close to 10% of your U.S. sales are less three, 10% or less forward. So I'm just wondering why we're not facing some inflationary pressures. Going into Q4 full that would need to be offset with price. Well, we've got part one and part two, which arguably are a lower amount of our cogs, which are laughing in Q4. So, we'll see less of an impact there. Q3, you're right. Is moving from 10% to 25% or did move from 10% to 25% in May. Again, I will take you back to the actual stated info tear off number versus realize, we are experiencing much less than the stated tariff number on an actual basis. So, it's hard to just look at what's stated and, look at the actual results. You really have to focus on the actual realized results. And our team's doing a very good job of working with our supplier partners to mitigate those increases.
Nigel Coe: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Patrick Baughman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Patrick Baughman: Hi, DG. Hi, Tom. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the Zoro business, if you could put a finer point on -- you said it's making money, is it making money this year. Is it kind of like a mid single digit type operating margin? I know MonotaROs in the low double digits. Just have a better sense of what the runway is there over the next several years. What the base is this year.
Thomas Okray: We are not going to go into specific breakout of Zoro, let's leave it. It's making a small amount of money this year.
Patrick Baughman: Okay, fair enough. And then, how should we think about the Louisville facility coming on line in the fourth quarter here. And then, into next year brought from I guess, what are your expectations from the market. Our growth or cost perspective and you mentioned supply chain favorability that you expect in the fourth quarter. I know that's part of it. Are respect some just curious any color on that?
Donald Macpherson: I think, I would answer that two ways. One is long-term [indiscernible] facility provides capacity and helpful capacity in a couple of ways. That first thing does it, it allows us to stock probably 200,000 more items in the network, because it's a very good pack up for Chicago, Greenville, New Jersey and even Dallas for some degree. It allows us to stock more items, add more breadth, which provides better customer experience. And typically that does drive growth. The other thing it does its next to the report. So, gives you [indiscernible] for sale items, before moving items in the network to get a customers who needs them and that's [indiscernible] customers. We are working through exactly how to bring the building up. We're starting to receive in the fourth quarter and we'll talk more about that at the end of the fourth quarter in terms of what we're using the building for exactly next year and how we're bringing that building up. It's huge and it's going to take a couple of years to get to full capacity for sure that we're going to leverage that building to provide better service to customers next year and improve our cost structure as well. So we'll, talk about that at the end of year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael McGinn from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.
Michael McGinn: Thanks a lot for the time. If I could switch gears to more of a long-term fundamental question regarding the endless assortment model? Having visited your new New Jersey DC, there was a distinct concerted effort on what shows up in a red box versus what shows up in a blue box. I'm just wondering, long-term, what kind of thresholds are you putting on the third-party market and maintain branding? Are they going to get national account freight pricing? How does that feed into your supplier rebate discussions longer-term, if you can just answer those quick questions, would be great.
Thomas Okray: So, we will have, as we build out the endless assortment, we will have partners that provide distinct over branding whether or not it's an acid box or a label is, is probably up for discussion at this point still. But, the idea is, we will make sure we became this overall branding. Zoro will have more ownership for its own state. It will still leverage free contracts that we have at Grainger and leverage some things at Grainger, but in general it will be more independent. The value proposition will be independent and the business was more independent.
Michael McGinn: And the growth of that business, does that feed into the general Grainger supplier rebate conversation or is that something separate?
Thomas Okray: For stuff that we stopped jointly? It definitely will or stuff that we don't it will not.
Operator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to DG Macpherson for any further closing or comments.
Donald Macpherson: Terrific. Thanks. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just reiterate what we feel are really important about our expectations moving forward. In our U.S. business, we feel that scale really, really matters and gaining share is incredibly important. And so our expectation is that we are going to grow revenue 340 basis points fashion in the market. We feel like we have a great opportunity to do that with a relatively stable gross profit and continuing leverage on the SG&A line going forward. In Canada, we have improved the customer experience. We are re-engaging customers in a positive way. And if we can get volume back into the business, which is our entire focus right now, we're going to be in a place to drive profitable growth. We're excited about being able to serve them all the investments we're making, even in Zoro excited about the growth path there. And we feel really, really good about a lot of the initiatives we have and the customer experience we're providing. So appreciate the time today and look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q2 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 press release, which is available on the IR website. Reported results in the second quarter included a $3 million benefit to operating earnings and a $0.03 benefit to EPS primarily related to a reduction in lease obligations in Canada. This morning's call we will focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Please also note within our comments we have removed the favorable timing impact of the North American sales meeting from gross profit margin and operating margin. The sales meeting had a positive 20 basis points impact on total company gross profit margin and operating margin and a positive 25 basis points impact on U.S. gross profit margin and operating margin. Now, I'll turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to discuss our first half and second quarter results and share an overview of what we're doing to drive growth in the U.S. and through our endless assortment model. Then Tom will provide details on the quarter, and we'll open it up for questions, The demand environment has softened throughout the year. Having said that, our strategy is grounding -- and grounded and having a value proposition that resonates through economic cycles. Through our high touch solutions model, we provide services and products to customers that help save them money, help them consolidate MRO spend, we manage their inventory, we provide solutions to simplify their purchasing process, we offer product substitution recommendations, we enable standardization across sites, and we help them keep their operations running and their people safe. In times of slower growth, we partner with our customers to lower their costs, which strengthens our relationships. We're confident in our ability to gain share in both up and down cycles with this model. With our endless assortment model customers value are streamlined search experience and expensive assortment. We're investing for growth through this model and are bullish on the path ahead. Turning to our performance so far this year, we delivered strong operating results in the first half of 2019, despite a slower global economy and significant investment in our endless assortment model. Year-to-date total company operating margin was 13%, up 50 basis points, and we've driven incremental margin of 42%. Operating cash flows in the first half of 2019 is up 14%. We’re through much of the heavy lifting on our cost takeout initiatives and are now focused squarely on driving profitable growth through our U.S. and endless assortment businesses. At AGI, the top line recovery has been slower than we anticipated. We made multiple changes in a short amount of time that caused disruption to our customer base and we've seen more volume lost than we expected. Revenue dollars were stable from first quarter to the second quarter, service is now once again strong when we started to win new business for the first time in a couple of years. We expect to see better performance in the second half of 2019. At Cromwell, we have made many changes to position the business for growth. We redesigned the distribution center and launched store at UK leveraging the Cromwell supply chain. Performance has lagged in the short-term resulting from market conditions and our actions in the region. Performances at UK has been very strong. We remain committed to this market. Our 2019, total company outlook remains the same for gross profit margins, operating margin and EPS based on our strong operating performance so far this year. We are lowering our estimate for market growth to minus 1% to 2% and lowering our revenue guidance with 2% to 5% growth due to the weaker demand environment and performance at AGI and Cromwell. Moving to the quarterly sales performance in the U.S., the U.S. MRO market growth is decelerated from 2% to 2.5% in Q1 to approximately 1% in Q2. We estimate U.S. market growth included about one point in price. As a reminder, these are internal estimates of market growth. The factors that determine market growth are finalized over the next 60 days. We expect the slow market growth to continue in the second half of 2019. In the quarter, market growth slowed across all of our end markets with the exception of health care. The core Grainger business grew about 150 basis points faster than the market. U.S. large customer daily sales growth was 2% and 11% on a two-year stack. U.S. midsize customer growth was 5% and 25% on a two-year stack. We got off to a slower start in the first half of the year for two reasons. First, as we’ve noted, we have seen a meaningful decline in the U.S. market growth from 2018. Second, we've implemented new initiatives to drive growth in 2019 and beyond and these activities take time to yield results. One example of this is our merchandising initiatives. We've completely revamped our category review process to include the voice of the customer more to ensure that we have the right assortment, and that it is presented in the right way to our customers. This will lead to strategic product ads and improve product presentation. The date we've implemented this approach on a small portion of our assortment, and the early results are very promising. We expect to be through about $1 billion worth of this assortment in the second half of the year and to accelerate these changes in 2020. We are confident in our ability to accelerate our share gain in the remainder of the year. Our updated sales guidance for 2019 implies U.S. share gain of about 300 basis points in the second half. And we are fully committed to 300 to 400 basis points about growth versus the market on average over the next several years. Let me spend a few minutes discussing our U.S. growth initiatives in the context of our value proposition. While we are in the early innings of these initiatives which are first shared in May we are encouraged by the results and remain committed to their implementation to drive the business forward. We generally think about them in two buckets. The first are improvements to our foundation that ensure that we stay competitive and the second are incremental investments that contribute to our long-term goal of 300 to 400 basis points of growth above market. In terms of what we call advantage MRO solutions we are investing in our foundation to allow us to offer better solutions for our customers. We are improving our product and customer information and building new data platform so that we can suggest more relevant solutions online over the phone at the branch and to our sellers. We expect to start reaping the benefit of these efforts in early 2020. We are also investing in our website to make the search process easier. Feedback from our customers is positive and improving we will continue to make enhancements to our website throughout the back half of 2019. To accelerate our growth, we are making incremental investments in marketing and merchandising. I've already talked about our merchandising initiatives, our marketing investments are focused on both digital and media, this spend has spread evenly throughout 2019 and we're seeing strong returns from these efforts. Moving to our second pillar differentiated sales and services, from a foundation perspective we are investing to refine our customer relationship management processes, increase in our efforts to serve specific markets more effectively and improving sales force effectiveness. In terms of inventory management, we have done some heavy lifting to realign our offer to drive profitability. Each stock which is the core piece of this offer is now profitable and ready to drive growth. Sales to the service represent 10% of net revenue in 2018 and total sales with these customers represent about 30% of the U.S. revenue. Over the long-term, we expect sales to keep stock to go much faster than the overall business. From an incremental perspective, we are expanding our service offering, which includes partnering with suppliers and utilizing our safety and other technical experts to help customers manage total cost and keep their facilities up and running and their people safe. We're also looking at targeted expansion of our sales force where it makes sense. We're planning this strategically at sellers to address changes and how customers buy and to be more relevant in select segments. With corporate accounts, we have been very focused to last two years on communications around the price changes, we are now in a position to deepen those relationships, to drive significant growth. These relationship stress from the plant floor to the C-suite and we have a significant opportunity to gain share with these customers based on the service and the capabilities that we can provide. Our last pillar is unparalleled customer service. Our first priority is always to deliver a seamless customer experience. We are known for this in the market and are focused on retaining this advantage throughout order of cash work. We have implemented a number of initiatives in the past year that have resulted in an improved customer experience. Our metrics have improved, and customer feedback is at an all-time best in getting better. In terms of fulfillment, we now have 600,000 products stocked in the U.S. very likely to when a customer places an order, we will have the products available for delivery next day and all in one box. We are adding capacity and capability with the addition of our distribution center in Louisville, which we expect to go online in early 2020. Louisville will have the most capacity in our network and we will enable us to stock up to 800,000 SKUs in the U.S. with potential for more. When we add stock items, we tend to see significant lift in revenue. Now historically, outside of the pricing reset, we get anywhere from slightly negative share gains to up to 300 basis points. When we've had share gain in the higher end, it's been by adding customer touches or products. The initiatives I've shared to you both, increased marketing, improve product assortment and navigation, expanded services and sales force additions and the opening of our Louisville BC is expected to allow us to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market over the midterm. I also want to spend a few minutes on the investments were making sort U.S. drive to drive long-term profitable growth. You heard us talk about expanding the product assortment. We plan to add 1 million new items to assortment this year, we've already had 400,000. Overall, we plan add 10 million items over the next three to five years, the product adds are driving revenue growth similar to what was seen historically at MonotaRO. Our investments in systems and people to help drive this growth are also going well. We are going live with the new product information management system for Zoro this year which will allow Zoro to add products at their own pace and to become less reliant on Grainger supply chain. We’re also improving our analytics platform which will help us better market our assortment to customers online. We are investing in Zoro for success. We expect the bulk of the infrastructure investments to be complete this year. We’re optimistic on the trajectory of this business going forward. Now, I’ll turn over to Tom who will discuss the quarter’s results in more detail.
Thomas Okray: Thanks, DG. Looking at our total company adjusted results for the quarter, sales were up 1% daily and up 2% on a constant currency basis. Volume was up 1.5% and price was up 0.5%. Year-to-date price was up 1%. More perspectives, our U.S. and endless assortment businesses which represents approximately 90% of total revenue were up 5% but were offset by headwinds at AGI and Cromwell. Moving to gross profit, our GP rate declined 35 basis points. The decline in GP rate versus the prior year was primarily driven by the other businesses. We drove operating earnings growth of 5% in the quarter, our operating margin grew 30 basis points versus the prior year due to gross margin in the U.S. Our cost takeout initiative at AGI and cost discipline in the U.S. and at the corporate level. For the quarter, we generated incremental margin of 39%. Operating cash flow was $323 million in the second quarter of 2019, up 30% driven by better operating earnings and favorable working capital versus the prior year period. Now let’s look at our performance in the U.S. As DG mentioned, the demand environment slowed sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Daily sales were up 2% composed of volume growth of 1.5% and price inflation of 0.5%. intercompany sales to Zoro contributed 0.5%, which were completely offset by the decline of specialty brand. Our GP rate increased 10 basis points excluding the remaining contract implementations, price cost spread was neutral. Gross profit margin also included a benefit from supply chain cost primarily related to freight and inventory optimization and positive mix. With respect to the remaining contract implementation, we’re on track to complete this work in 2019 with only 5% remaining. In the quarter, we passed through a majority of tariff and non-tariff related cost inflation while ensuring that our pricing was market based. We still expect price cost to be neutral for the year excluding the remaining contract implementations and we’ve taken the following approach to mitigate any headwinds associated with price cost. With price, one of the main objectives of the reset was to ensure our pricing was market competitive. We can move web price fluidly throughout the year to ensure that we are priced appropriately. With contract customers, we can adjust price a few times during the year and we manage these relationships in terms of total cost ownership to ensure the customers are getting the most value. On the cost side, we’ve been very happy with our ability to navigate the tariff environment. As a reminder, we have a cross functional team that meets regularly and is worked to minimize the impact. You may recall we originally expected about 2% cogs inflation related to tariffs. Our actual exposure through working with our supplier partners has proven to be much less. More specifically, we’ve leveraged our scale and maintained strong relationships with our suppliers allowing us to better predict and manage cost headwinds. Also, we continuously evaluate our product portfolio to ensure we have the best product at the best cost which includes optimizing sources of supply. Moving to operating earnings. Operating margin was up 60 basis points in the U.S. SG&A was flat and sales growth of 2%. Our continued cost discipline has enabled us to maintain SG&A while growing revenue. And we remained fully committed to growing SG&A at half the rate of sales on an ongoing basis. In Canada, daily sales were down 23% and down 20% on a constant currency basis. Price was up 3% and volume was down 23%. Volume decline nearly resulted from the customer disruptions related to the turnaround activities we took last year. Gross profit Margin was down 150 basis points in the quarter due to negative price cost spread. While we were able to pass through price in the quarter cost was unfavorable due primarily to lower vendor rebates on softer volume and the foreign exchange impact of U.S. denominated product purchases. SG&A was down 26% versus the prior year, driven by the cost takeout initiative. Operating margin was down 30 basis points in the quarter reflecting lower gross profit margin partially offset by favorable SG&A rate. We expect performance in Canada to improve in the second half of the year. Late in the quarter, we saw encouraging data showing that service levels and web sales were improving. As DG mentioned, daily sales were flat from Q1 to Q2 indicating signs of stabilization on the top line. Recall that most of the significant volume decline associated with the turnaround actions occurred in the second half of 2018, therefore, we will have easier top line comparisons in the second half of 2019. Moving on to other businesses. As a reminder, other businesses include our endless assortment model and our international portfolio. Daily sales were up 6.5% in the second quarter, and up 9.5% on a constant currency basis due to strong revenue from our endless assortment model. MonotaRO continues to grow significantly, and we're making good progress with our growth initiatives at Zoro. Gross profit margin for the other businesses declined 220 basis points, driven by promotional activities at Zoro, unfavorable customer mix at Cromwell and freight headwinds in Japan. Operating margin declined 290 basis points for the other businesses, primarily driven by investments in Zoro U.S. to drive long-term growth and performance at Cromwell. Page 15 covers our guidance for 2019. The total company level, we are reiterating our gross profit margin, operating margin and EPS guidance for the year. Our U.S. segment operating performance is strong and is more than offsetting slower performance at AGI and Cromwell. We expect U.S segment operating margin to be at the high end of the guidance range. While AGI is expected to be towards the low end of the range. For other businesses, we are updating our operating margin guidance from 6% to 8% to 4% to 6% due primarily to performance at Cromwell. Moving to our sales expectations. Our view of the MRO market has also changed from April, instead of 1% to 4% growth, we now expect negative 1% to positive 2% market growth for 2019. Due to the slower demand environment, uncertain economic conditions, the early stages of our US growth initiatives and performance at both AGI and Cromwell, we are lowering our top line guidance from 4% to 8.5% to 2% to 5%. Now I'll turn it back to DG for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. I would like to close by reminding you of our long-term performance expectations. We expect our initiatives in the U.S. to allow us to grow revenue 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market, on average over the next several years. We believe Canada is an attractive market for Grainger to be in, it can grow faster than the market and be a double-digit operating margin business over the next five years. We expect continued strong growth with our endless assortment models to the strength of MonotaRO in Japan and the investments we're making in Zoro U.S. Overall, we expect to drive strongest SG&A leverage and continued operating margin improvement resulting from incremental margin of 20% to 25%. Now, I will open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.
David Manthey: Hi, thank you, good morning. Initially you are targeting double-digit growth within the U.S. medium customer set and now we're down the sort of a mid-single-digit growth rate this quarter, you mentioned the fluidity of pricing. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can talk about there as it relates to price refinements to try to re-accelerate the medium customer growth that you've made recently, or you plan to make?
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Dave. So, we still believe that we can grow midsize customers much faster than the market. We will need to grow them faster than 300 to 400 basis points faster than the markets to be able to hit our overall targets. We have some good signs with our midsize customers. I would say that covered customers have continued to grow very strongly which is a signal that if the customers we've acquired are actually repeating at very strong rates, which is great to see. We feel like we have some efforts initiatives going with merchandising and marketing that can help us accelerate growth. I would point out that pretty new to us to be through the pricing changes and focusing on the midsize customers so we're learning every day what's working and what's not. And we're going to know more as we go forward, but we still feel confident and we can grow significantly though that customers, support pretty all economics of the company.
David Manthey: Okay. And then as it relates to the reduction in the revenue outlook. I would assume that has more to do with your outlook for U.S. market growth just based on percentages than international or internal disruption. But if you run the numbers based on the full year guidance to some extent it might imply flat to lower growth in the market, in the second half of this year and I am just wondering your thoughts on how severe this slowdown might be and is there a recession in your forecasting right now?
Donald Macpherson: Great question, when we talked about a lot. I would say we are certainly not going to forecast a recession and what we see in the market in the U.S. has been slow growth, but pretty stable over the last several months. So, we don't see anything that implies that we are heading off the cliff in the U.S. obviously internationally, there is pockets that are more problematic than others, but in general, we’re not forecasting negative necessarily. We think it's a possibility that probably not a probability at this point.
David Manthey: Thanks, DG.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research Group. Please state your question.
Robert Barry: Hey guys, good morning.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Robert Barry: So, I just wanted to circle back on the price, I mean I think the price flowed from 1.5% in the first quarter to 0.5 in 2Q tariff headwinds they are kind of moving in the other direction. So just curious how you're thinking about tariffs and other inflation and help price might track over the next couple of quarters, kind of vis-à-vis what's happening in tariffs and inflation?
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Robert. I would say the tariff environment is still a significant uncertainty and we'll see what happens in the next couple months in terms of resolving it or not. Our philosophy is to make sure that we are priced to the market. We will continue to make sure we are priced competitively to be able to serve our customers well and we will take actions to make sure we will get it every day basically to make sure we're priced at the appropriate range. So that's really our philosophy and that's what we're focused on, just some uncertainty as to whether or not the tariffs are going to come through in a bigger way which gives price may go up or not, but our focus is really on making sure market competitive in terms of price.
Robert Barry: Got it. I mean just to clarify a couple of things, I mean since the list three didn’t move up, I mean is that going to be a bigger headwind for you in the back half and if you're pricing the market is the fact that the pricing moderated at Grainger mean that what you're seeing in the market, I guess is to like, customers are not getting as much price.
Thomas Okray: Yeah, we've been planning for the change for quite some time. The way we've got it modeled is it's relatively small, as we said in the prepared remarks, we've been able to realize substantially less than the overall exposure. So, we don't believe that the change and in [indiscernible] is going to be that material for us.
Robert Barry: Got it. Could I just clarify one more thing, when you're talking about getting the outgrowth from what I think a point in 2Q to three points in the second half? Is it all these items on slide eight that you think are driving it and are they all just adding like 20 or 30 bps or is there one or two of them that's going to like to drive the lion share of the acceleration?
Donald Macpherson: So, yeah, thanks for asking that. We will provide more detail going forward, how much we expect each to provide. I will say that this is a pretty big shift for us and mindset shift in the sense that we've tracked market share in the past, but we've never targeted market share growth. And we've never had a set of initiatives that we are expecting to align to that growth, at least not explicitly. And we do plan to become more explicit overtime, I gave the example of merchandising in the prepared remarks, which I think is a good one where this is a little bit new to us, we are having to break down some barriers to execute faster and move faster on some things and we're seeing good results. And we do expect that that momentum to continue to build. And so, we'll provide more of the specific details. But know that page eight is pretty important for us right now, I would say.
Robert Barry: All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn, with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.
Christopher Glynn: Yeah, thanks. Just had a couple questions about the endless assortment strategy, there. The incremental investment you're putting in this year, is that investment in the cost base, or does it tail off next year? And what do you thinking about timeframe for that business to be standalone capable?
Donald Macpherson: Yeah. So that, -- let me get to the last one second, most of the investments that we're making, in terms of getting platform and platform independence should be -- we should be through that by the end of this year. So, we expect some of the costs we've added in terms of analytics and people to stay, but a lot of the cost will fall off next year, as well. In terms of standalone, it'll come in pieces. So, one of the biggest things we're doing is developing the capability for that business to add their own items and they add items from third-party shippers, which will make that business less reliant on Grainger obviously, for the core Grainger items Grainger will still fulfill, but that business will become less directly reliant on the Grainger supply chain overtime. And so that should be -- we're going to implement that system in the third quarter, by the end of the year, we should have that capability. Similarly, the data analytics platform should be complete by the end of the year. So, a lot of this should really be through this year in terms of giving that business more independence. And that's really what we're targeting.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the medium, if you go a little deeper into what you're seeing in terms of customer retention versus the paid visions, and overall, how is the base holding on from the initial burst of growth there?
Donald Macpherson: So, the basis holding on quite well, as I mentioned, we’ve taken a portion of that base, about half of the midsize customers are now in some sort of coverage model and that has continued to grow at a pretty good clip. So, the base is held on pretty well, and we are acquiring customers, as well, but certainly we're happy with what we see with the base.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray, with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, it was really interesting about what you did not say in your prepared remarks or in your slides, there was no comment about weather and we've seen all kinds of pressures on your peers and you had to have felt some of the same pressures because this was a -- it was an important HVAC opportunity for your filters and refreshing refrigerants and so forth, But it didn't seem to impact you and maybe can clarify what sort of pressures you did see or did not see?
Donald Macpherson: Yeah, I mean, certainly the weather was not helpful, but it is a very small impact to us. It's less than 0.5% impact, so we didn’t call that out as a separate item.
Deane Dray: Good. Appreciate that. And then just to clarify and just to make sure I'm clear on this, when you cut the sales high ended guidance, you’ve cut that more than what the market growth cut on the high end, so 3.5 points on your sales, high end so why are you cutting that more, is that all Canada and Cromwell and just to clarify that, please.
Donald Macpherson: Yeah, it’s a lot of it is Cromwell and Canada shrinking, so that’s a big part of it absolutely.
Deane Dray: Got it. And just one last quick one, it’s helpful on the appendix where you give the monthly progression, and can you comment on how June ended as being the strongest month and what sort of set up have you seen in July so far?
Donald Macpherson: Yeah, I mean we don’t want to over index on any monthly trends given some of the noise that can happen in the month. I would say that we do feel like we gained a little bit more share in June and we do feel like the market like I mentioned before is not falling off a cliff. We expect to be in a slow growth market moving forward and it’s been pretty stable from our perspective over the last several months.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzwinksi with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Hi, good morning guys. On the -- and I appreciate these color you guys gave on the tariff environment and the ability to navigate that a little bit better as we move into this 25% in less three, maybe I missed it, but how would you kind of check that against the pricing environment out there, so maybe have to ask for a little bit less price, but what’s the appetite in the market some other folks in the space have mentioned that’s gotten a bit more challenging, what would be your take on those?
Donald Macpherson: Yeah, we’re finding that we’re able to pass on most of the tariffs related price increases. The one thing that we called out in terms of price neutral is the only thing impacting that that we excluded was the price reset. We’ve had a great relationship on the tariff side working with our supplier partners. They want to sell the products with us, and it’s been going extremely well as a result Jeff.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Got it. That’s helpful. And then just coming back to analyst assortment, obviously there’s some kind of strategic synergy or operation playbook synergy from MonotaRO with Zoro. Once Zoro is further down the path and maybe just kind of learned all it can, is there a place for MonotaRO in the portfolio just given that it’s a little bit more distant and probably doesn’t give full credit from an external perspective given the strength of the business?
Donald Macpherson: Yeah so right now we’re learning a lot from MonotaRO. There’s a lot to learn from their success. There is probably more leadership synergy than might be easy to recognize in a sense that the leaders of all of the businesses get together frequently and talk about what they’re doing. We haven’t talked much about Zoro UK, the Zoro UK is on a terrific path and will be profitable early 2020, that’s probably because of the linkages they have with MonotaRO and Zoro U.S. It’s a fair question but for now we certainly feel like we’re getting a lot of synergies out of the portfolio and it’s an important part of our portfolio going forward.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Got it. Thanks for the color. I'll leave it there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.
Ryan Merkel: Hi, thanks. So, first off really nice job on the U.S. margins. My question is what is depriving you positively to hit the high end of the operating margin guidance just given the slower sales trajectory?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I think it's been our ability to generate incremental margin. We know we’re in a choppy slowing market and our sales growth isn’t going to be as great as we had planned. We’re doing a lot of good work on cogs as we described. I think managing the tariff environment very well. We’re being very fiscally responsible on SG&A, while also really continuing to invest in our priorities, advertising, digital. So, it’s really comes down to our ability to generate incremental margin. I mean we had very good results as we called out.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, that’s helpful. And then moving to Canada. I hear you're saying average daily sales are stable from the first quarter, but the recovery still seems to be tracking a little bit slower. So, what are the main issues and then any change to getting to breakeven by the fourth quarter?
Donald Macpherson: The main issues have been when we went through some of the changes was first significant and there were many changes that we made. We had some customer's instruction that we are fully expecting. I would say the most important thing for me is that the services improved in the business, we're hearing better things from our customers, we're starting to win back some customers which is really, really important. I think the business is very well-positioned from a cost and business model perspective now. And we need to get the top-line going and that’s taken a little bit longer than we thought that’s really the only thing that concerns us at this point, can we get the top-line going.
Ryan Merkel: And then breakeven by the fourth quarter 2019, is there any update there that you can provide?
Thomas Okray: As we said in our guidance, which is 1 to 54 for Canada, we believe to be tracking to the low end, so the answer would be yes, breakeven -- better than breakeven for the year.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, great. Thanks.
Thomas Okray: Welcome.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please state your question.
John Inch: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can we talk about the trajectory in the quarter? Was there a step down from the first to second quarter as we hit April and then how did sort of medium versus large play out sequentially, if there is any color you could provide there that gives us, DG you've said that that's stable, but you know, it seems - the number seem sort of low but it looks like they picked up, is there any color you can provide?
Donald Macpherson: Certainly, I would say May was lower across all segments if that’s what you are referring to and June was better. I would say some of that are factors that are frankly not worth talking about from the last year or two in terms them setting the baseline that you're comparing to. But certainly, we don't see like I said before, we don't see anything falling off a cliff and we do see midsize customers growing faster than the rest of the business and we would expect to see that going forward.
John Inch: But it sounds like you are sort of downplaying the significance of at least the monthly June take back up to 3%, is that the function of compares or is it just you don't want to get ahead of your skis by overpromising just based on one month?
Donald Macpherson: I guess I would downplay May being down as well as low.
John Inch: Right.
Donald Macpherson: So, we would say that the quarter was -- if you average out the quarter that makes sense in terms of what we see from market growth.
John Inch: And was thee a disconnect between the kind of the large versus the medium going back to my prior question, and as you exited, there wasn’t really, so I mean ...
Donald Macpherson: No, not really.
John Inch: It seems like medium, there is going to be pretty challenged to get back to double digit is that fair or do you see?
Donald Macpherson: In the short-term that would be fair, like I said we're learning every day and we're doing things to continue to improve the trajectory and we like what we’re seeing, but certainly in the short-term, that’s true.
John Inch: And then your margin guidance for the year, right, implies a significant step down from really commendable performance from the growth in non-profit margin side especially in the U.S. to sort of the total guide, which remains unchanged for the back half, what exactly is that seasonality or are there other things going on there or you just being conservative or why didn't you, why the step down I guess, particularly the midpoint.
Thomas Okray: You are referring to the U.S., so you're referring to the U.S.?
John Inch: Well, kind of the whole thing right, just if you look at the guide. But then you look at the, with just the complexion of what's driving that right?
Thomas Okray: Right. Okay. There is some seasonality as you look at the way we performed historically. The gross margin does go down over the year, also recognizing the uncertain economic environment we're in, we just thought it would be prudent to be cautious in this and we measured in our guidance range.
John Inch: So, Tom there is no price cost dynamic, I mean I know you talked about tariffs, you feel like you're on top of it, but there is no other price cost dynamic that's kind of playing out here that would be driving some of that disruptions?
Thomas Okray: No.
John Inch: All right, then it almost implies the guy could have a little cushion in it, is that fair?
Thomas Okray: Seasonality and just the economic environment that we're in, I think it pays to be prudent.
John Inch: Agreed. All right, thank you very much.
Thomas Okray: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with G Research. Please state your question.
Justin Bergner: Good morning, DG. Good morning, Tom.
Thomas Okray: Good morning.
Justin Bergner: Just on the guide, maintained margin guide, at least at the company level on. 2% plus lower sales. Just mathematically would suggest that EPS would be 2% lower, but it seems like you're maintaining that. So, should we also read that you're expecting operating margins to be a little bit above the midpoint of the guide at the company level to offset the lower sales?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I'm really not going to get into where we think we're going to land in the range other than what we said in the prepared remarks. We've been running the play in the first half of, not getting the sales we've wanted, generating very strong incremental margins. And we're going to continue to do that in the back half. And we think it'll work out well for us. But it really doesn’t want to get into going forward where we think we're going to land in the range.
Justin Bergner: Understood. And then on repurchases. I guess you did a healthy amount of purchases this quarter, you've done $400 million year to date, that would put you tracking, at or above the high end of your range. If you sort of annualize that. Are you potentially going to do more repurchases in your earlier guide, or were they just more weight into the second quarter?
Donald Macpherson: So, I would go back to our capital structure tenants, one of the tenants that we have is we don't want to hold any excess cash. And we were in a good position where we were, we had generated quite a bit of cash and we just use that to return back to the shareholders. So, really nothing to read into that. As it goes to our initial guide, we're sticking with that and if it changes, we'll talk about it, next quarter.
Justin Bergner: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Patrick Baughman with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Patrick Baughman: Hi, good morning, DG. Good morning, Tom. A few follow ups here. So, really good job on SG&A control in the first half of the year. Really, it looks like it was down year-over-year. on a material to basis. Can you take it down again year-over-year in the second half? And I'm just trying to understand what the levers are for that if you can. I ask because you said the cost actions are now, I guess complete. So, I'm just kind of curious of the levers on SG&A.
Thomas Okray: Yeah, our philosophy is that you can always optimize SG&A. And we will continue to look at that every day. The way we're looking at those is really trying to get to our 20% to 25% incremental margin. I mean, that's the objective that the organization is focused on. But there's always, there's always ways to take out costs. I think of the prepared remarks; the cost and cost takeout’s ending were primarily related to Canada.
Donald Macpherson: And I would also just add that, I think if you look at our cost structure, a big part of our cost structure is process costs of distribution centers, contact centers. We've made some pretty big changes, for example, our contact centers, they are performing quite well now. They're going to continue to get better and better. So, maybe the restructuring is done, but we expect every single year to get continuous improvement out of our big out of our big operations and we continue to see that and would expect to see that going forward. So, it's not like we're not going to improve our cost structure. It's just that we may not have as much restructuring type things.
Thomas Okray: And I just finally I would add one important thing is even in this down market, because of what DG talked about our focus on market share and our focus on growth. We are not backing off of any of our strategic initiatives spending to hit an SG&A number. We're continuing to go forward full speed on that.
Patrick Baughman: Do you think SG&A can decline in the second half year over year? And what, what drives, and I think last year and some big profit-sharing headwinds in the second half that were an impact in the numbers there. And I'm just, so maybe that's an easy comp. I don't know. I'm just trying to kind of tie those all the stuff together here.
Thomas Okray: Yes, we do have an easier comp as far as variable compensation. What I would say for the second half is we expect the SG&A rate to be lower than the previous year for sure.
Patrick Baughman: The -- as a percent of your sales, you're just saying that the level of SG&A.
Thomas Okray: That’s the percentage of sales and we also expect the second half of the year to perform better than the first half of the year as it relates to favorability to the prior year.
Patrick Baughman: From an absolute dollar perspective.
Thomas Okray: From a rate perspective.
Patrick Baughman: From a rate perspective, got it, understand. And was that profit-sharing expense line, was that a help in the second quarter year-over-year, was it a tailwind?
Thomas Okray: Sure. Yeah.
Patrick Baughman: And then just. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
Donald Macpherson: That's okay. That's okay. Yes.
Patrick Baughman: And then DNA looks like it's down year-to-date. What's driving that?
Thomas Okray: That's compared to last year, we had some issues in terms of keep stock, right, awesome machines, older machines that we replace. We also had some capital expenditures at two of our bigger DCs. So, we had a favorable compare there to last quarter.
Patrick Baughman: Thank you.
Thomas Okray: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bhupinder Bora [ph] with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Bhupinder here, sitting in for Nigel. So, just, Tom, I think you mentioned you gave some guidance on the other businesses margin here, can you just give some more color on those margins targets and what your confidence is actually in the back half to achieve those targets for the year?
Thomas Okray: Yeah, we took down the other business unit operating margin target, primarily due to the performance in our Cromwell business unit. Obviously with the uncertainty of Brexit also that just combined with the transformation that we've got going on in that entity, where we're really changing the business model there in terms of being decentralized with the branch network and trying to have more centralization. Some of the things that we've noted on Canada, we're seeing there where we've disrupted the customer base, those types of things. So that's why we're taking down primarily for the other business unit.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and is investment spending a big part of that or is it pretty small, I mean you guys have done with ...
Donald Macpherson: Certainly, the investment spending in Zoro in the U.S. is a big part that was planned at the beginning of the year. And we are we are spending that money and seeing what we want to see out of that. So, we had always planned for the Zoro margins to come down in the year. And that's what we're seeing. So that's when we talk about investment spending, that's really what we're referring to.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. If I can, another one here on pricing, as we saw in the first quarter pricing was 1.5, 2.5. How should we think about the back half, because when you look at last year, second half, I think we had pretty kind of close to 100 bps, actually pricing every quarter. Are we going to see much more realization what we have seen in the quarter, or as kind of tariffs kick in, like in the second half List 3, so if you can give some color on that? Thanks,
Donald Macpherson: I think, like we said before, I think our focus really is to make sure that we are market priced in everything that we do. Depending on how the tariffs play out, that could mean more price or less price, I think and that there is some uncertainty around that. But we are tracking and watching this very, very closely and our objective always to make sure that we're priced competitively, and we will make sure we do that.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Steve Barger: Hey, good morning. Just looking at heavy manufacturing down low single digit and natural resources down mid-single. In general, what are the customers or your sales force saying there, is there an expectation for improvement in the back half of those segments?
Thomas Okray: It's hard to tell. I mean, heavy manufacturing was basically flat for the second quarter, actually, in June, the overall market I'm referring to is actually negative. So, it's hard to tell where that segments going to go. Obviously, we've got a number of initiatives in play, which DG referenced in the prepared remarks in the Q&A. We think despite that down or slowing market, we're going to be able to gain share.
Steve Barger: And just more broadly, given softer markets are customers leaning towards lowering reorder points or the amount of inventory they're willing to hold. And does that change how you think about inventory at the DCs.
Donald Macpherson: Generally, not much. I mean, the reality is that customers don't hold a whole bunch of our inventory anyway. And the way we've structured most of our large customer relationships, we're helping them manage your inventory, we set MOQs that allow them to operate at a pretty lean level. So, we don't see a lot of channel loading or anything like that, with our customers, given that the business model, and our business model is based on this entirely on helping them manage your inventory effectively.
Steve Barger: Got it. Thanks.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you.
Thomas Okray: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please state your question.
John Inch: Yeah, just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about Europe. One of the things we've gleaned this quarter thus far from other companies is the European economies are actually starting to show up in a much more pronounced basis negatively. And it implied that the other business results were more UK Brexit oriented, maybe a little bit of your own affliction. What's going on, actually, with respect to Fabory and just what you're seeing in continental Europe? And does that way on the results and have any sort of bearing on the second half in terms of your own expectations?
Donald Macpherson: I think what we've seen over there, as we've seen, obviously, the UK market has been struggling a bit. And we've seen some manufacturers shift some of their production from UK to the Mainland of Europe. The favorite businesses had sort of consistent, modest growth this year, we think the market in the Netherlands and Belgium where they are, it's been up, combined, but not thought up significantly. Certainly, there are signs of some pressures in the European market. But what we see that favorite hasn't really weighed on results, so we are feeling in the UK has.
John Inch: And the expectation that you achieve because you think it's just more of the same coming or the reasons based on just extra quarter trends or anything else. So, things get better, a little bit worse?
Donald Macpherson: Yeah, and I would just, I would just remind, they may get a little bit worse, I would just remind you that we are very small and Fabory. So, it doesn't have a meaningful impact on us right now. So, I don't -- and I also don't know that we have the best lens. I mean, we have the lenses, the Netherlands primarily and some Belgium business. So, we don't have anything really in France speaking of a very, very little in Spain. So, we don't really have much exposure to the big markets to have a position.
John Inch: Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with G Research. Please state your question.
Justin Bergner: Guys, thanks for the follow-up. With respect to neutral price cost, are you seeing any different dynamic between sort of the industrial part of your portfolio and the non-industrial part of your portfolio? Just given some of the comments from other MRO distributors earlier in the quarter.
Donald Macpherson: I have to think about that. I'm not sure I have a great answer for you to be honest. My inkling is probably not seeing much different. But I don't know that I could necessarily say that with certainty. I've looked at the total. And I'd have to go ask some questions about that. Interesting question.
Justin Bergner: Okay, great. And then lastly, with respect to the endless assortment model, you use the term continuous growth versus accelerating growth? Does that just reflect more challenging end markets? Or is there anything sorts of structural to be read into that changing language?
Donald Macpherson: The structural, I think there's a sort of law of the universe, which is always been growing over 24 the first 5 or 6 years. If we want to continue to grow in the 20s. We view something else given as it gets bigger, that becomes harder to do. So, we didn't want you to think that we're going to accelerate from the 20s to the 30s or 40s, we're going to try to continue to have a strong growth rate.
Justin Bergner: Great. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Patrick Baughman with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Patrick Baughman: Hi. Thanks for giving me follow-up. I just wanted to follow-up; you've mentioned keep stock. And you said it's now profitable and was 10% of the business in 2018 and will grow faster, I guess then the rest of the business going forward. There hasn't been a ton of visibility here the last couple years. So just curious, if you could give a quick update and kind of what you've been doing there? Was it losing money last year and kind of what changes have you made to improve profitability and make you feel like you can grow it better and more profitably in the future?
Thomas Okray: Yes. We have about 3 years ago, 2 to 3 years ago, we made some changes and that's improved the profitability. We're now squarely in the place where we're building new capabilities. We've done some work on software, we've done some work on visibility and analytics and reporting to help customers understand the value that we're bringing, and we're going to continue to push on those things. The comments it's really around, we haven't for a couple of years, we hadn't been focused as much on capability building as we improve the profitability and now, we're really focused on that. And so that's going to be our focus going forward.
Donald Macpherson: I think it's important to note that in June, we had our fastest growth way that we had in two years related to keep stock.
Patrick Baughman: Got it. Okay, make sense. Thanks again. Good luck.
Thomas Okray: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Thanks. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. DG Macpherson for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: All right, thanks for joining us. I would just reiterate a couple of points. One is, in the U.S. given the profitability, we are really focused on growth and gaining share going forward and it’s a bit of a new orientation for us to say, we’re going to gain share on a consistent basis. But we are wiring ourselves up to be able to do that and that’s our primary focus and the other is the online model continues to be here profitable on a fast grower and so we’re investing to make sure we can do that. If those two things go well, we’re pretty excited about the future and I look forward to talking to you one on one, so thanks for your time and I appreciate you on the phone.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. All participants may disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-22 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q1 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q1 press release, which is available on the IR website. Looking at our reported results for the year, we had adjustments resulting in a $2 million impact to operating earnings and a $0.03 impact to EPS. Adjustments included restructuring related to Canada. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Now, I'll turn it over to D.G.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'll share an overview of the business, including how we deliver value for our customers and a discussion of our results, then Tom will provide details on the quarter, and we'll open it up for questions. First, let me tell you what we're seeing with our customers. We spent a lot of time with our customers to understand their needs and that's not just with the C suite but with the people who buy our products and the people on the shop or who use them. That way we can deliver relevant solutions that help solve their problems better than anyone else. And what always excites me are the relationships that we have. Our relationships are a unique competitive advantage and they are getting stronger. I recently spent time with a spice manufacturing company. This is a very successful business. It's been around for over 100 years. And we have very strong relationships throughout the business, including with the safety manager, the operations manager and the plant controller. And those relationships helped make our two-hour long visit very productive. We discussed a solution to optimize their spend on hearing protection. We had a roundtable with all the plant leadership that surface new opportunities, and we spent time documenting the value Grainger provides to the plant controller. Now, as customers experience our broad product line, our technical expertise, our great service and our fast and dependable shipping, we're getting more opportunities. Our goal is to accelerate the pace and intensity with which we demonstrate value to our customers so that we can take advantage of those opportunities. Our team is up for that challenge. As I mentioned before, we create value for customers through two business models. The first is the high-touch solutions model that serves customers with complex needs. Our Grainger U.S., Canada and Mexico businesses plus Cromwell and Fabory all fit within this model. The second is the endless assortment model that is focused on customers with less complex needs. This model includes Zoro and MonotaRO and delivers value through a streamlined and simple transaction experience. In each model, we are laser-focused on executing a strategy designed to expand our competitive advantage. So let's move on to our performance in the quarter, and I'll start with the U.S. The U.S. market was choppy to start the year due to the uncertainty around tariffs, the government shutdown and the inclement weather. While we continue to see growth across all of our end markets, we did see market growth slow versus 2018. We estimate that the U.S. market grew about 2% to 2.5% in Q1, including approximately one point in price. As a reminder, we lapped a majority of the pricing changes in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the past, we have used COGS as a proxy for volume to measure our growth with large and midsize customers. Moving forward, we're going to use daily sales growth to simplify our communication around large and midsize performance. In the first quarter, U.S. large customer daily sales growth was 5% and 11% on a two-year stack. U.S. midsize customer growth was 9% with volume growth of about 8%. On a two-year stack, midsize revenue grew 24%. In the quarter, we continued to refine our approach with midsize customers, including more aggressive marketing and some market-based pricing adjustments. Given what we've seen so far, we are confident in our continued growth with midsize customers. We expect both large and midsize customer growth to accelerate on a two-year stack in the second quarter. First quarter sales growth in the U.S. included 1.5 percentage points of price as we pass through both tariff and non-tariff related cost inflation. The uncertainty around tariffs made predicting price a bit more difficult to start the year and we're continuing to adjust prices up and down to ensure that we're market relevant. We spent a lot of time last year executing our pricing changes. We've now shifted to spending more time with customers talking about the value that we create. Our focus is on a few core initiatives that will help us drive growth both through increasing share of wallet and new customer acquisition. With our large complex customers, we're continuing to work with our sellers and other service representatives to get them information that helps them have better conversations. We launched a value documentation tool last year to help sellers demonstrate the value we bring to customers through activities such as inventory management, energy management and safety solutions. When I visit our large customers, I'm routinely reminded of our opportunity to gain share. These customers love working with Grainger and there's definitely room to grow our relationships with them. For the midsize business, we're seeing growth both with existing and new customers. We are expanding our relationships with these customers through pricing programs, including our Red Pass program which has a free freight component, midsize customers with attractive profiles are getting covered by inside sales teams, and that team continues to drive growth with these customers. Across the U.S. business, we are actively working on improving our merchandising capability, and we will be adding products to our assortment as an outcome of this work. We are also increasing our marketing dollars and seeing very strong returns on those investments. Overall, we remain confident in our position relative to the market in the U.S., including our ability to grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the market this year. In Canada, we continued on our path to stem the volume losses and drive towards sustainable profitable growth. With the cost takeout largely behind us, our focus is squarely on initiatives that will help drive top line performance. We believe our service levels have stabilized and we're starting to hear from customers that our service has improved. We have reworked our sales coverage model and our sellers are excited about driving growth. Finally, we're starting to gain traction as we leverage our U.S. assortment in Canada and improve our website functionality. We've seen early signs that our volume is starting to stabilize, which is encouraging. We continue to expect Canada to be profitable for the year. For our other businesses, our top line performance was driven by the strength of the endless assortment model. MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the U.S. together drove daily sales growth of 22% for the quarter. On the fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we would be investing to accelerate growth for the Zoro business in 2019. We made incremental investments in systems, marketing, and talent in the first quarter, and we expect these investments to accelerate growth in the next year and beyond. Looking at our international portfolio, Cromwell continue to be challenged in the first quarter due to several factors, including the Brexit dynamic in the United Kingdom. The other businesses in the portfolio performed well. For the Company, we performed largely in line with expectations in the quarter. As I mentioned, revenue was a little softer than we'd like, and profitability was strong. Gross profit was down 15 basis points after normalizing for the timing of the North American sales meeting, and we drove strong expense leverage across the business. Total Company operating margin grew 80 basis points after normalizing for the timing of the sales meeting. We are reiterating our 2019 total Company guidance. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom who will discuss the quarter's results in more detail.
Thomas Okray: Thanks D.G. Total Company sales in the quarter were up 3% daily and up 4% daily on a constant currency basis. Sales in the quarter included a negative 0.5% impact from the lapping of a prior-year change in accounting estimate. More specifically, a small group of U.S. customers were transitioned from cash to accrual basis accounting as a result of their improved credit profile. Excluding the change, daily sales were up 4.5% on a constant currency basis. Volume was up 3% and price was up 1.5%. Moving to gross profit, our Q1 gross profit rate was impacted by the timing of our North American sales meeting. Suppliers provide funding for our sales meeting, and this funding benefits gross profit margin. We spread the benefit over three consecutive months beginning in the month of the sales meeting. In 2018, the sales meeting occurred in February, and in 2019 the sales meeting occurred in March. Normalizing for this impact, gross profit margin declined 15 basis points driven primarily by the other businesses. We drove operating earnings growth of 6% in the quarter and operating margin expanded by 80 basis points versus the prior year after normalizing for the timing of the sales meeting. We continued to drive SG&A leverage as a result of our expense management and productivity improvements, including the 2018 cost takeout actions in Canada. Operating cash flow was down 14% primarily due to the payout of 2018 incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2019. Now let's take a look at our performance in the U.S. As D.G. mentioned, the demand environment was a bit weaker than expected. Daily sales were up 3.5% and up 4.5% after normalizing for the prior year change in accounting estimate. Sales growth was comprised of volume growth of 2.5%, price inflation of 1.5% and intercompany sales growth of 0.5%. Our normalized GP rate increased 35 basis points after adjusting for the timing of the sales meeting. Freight was favorable in the quarter versus the prior year due to less reliance on the spot market and better-than-expected spot rates. Favorable mix also contributed to the increase in gross profit margin. Including the contract implementations, price cost spread was neutral in the quarter. Operating margin normalized for the timing of the sales meeting was up 50 basis points. SG&A grew at half the rate of sales and incremental margin for the U.S. business was a strong 31%. In Canada, daily sales were down 24% and down 20% on a constant currency basis. Price was up 4% and volume was down 24%. Gross profit margin was down 125 basis points in the quarter due to a higher E&O write-down, which is tied to our lower volume. SG&A improved by more than 30% in the quarter due to our cost takeout actions in 2018. We stem the losses versus the prior year, and operating margin improved 240 basis points. We expect performance in Canada to continue to improve throughout the year as our top line initiatives begin to take shape. Moving on to other businesses. As a reminder, other businesses include our endless assortment model in our international businesses. Daily sales were up 9.5% in the quarter and up 12% on a constant currency basis on strong revenue from our endless installment model. Gross profit margin declined 190 basis points driven by unfavorable customer mix at Cromwell and freight headwinds in Japan. Operating margin declined 160 basis points for the other businesses. As D.G. mentioned, we are making investments in Zoro U.S. to drive long-term growth. Those investments, plus performance at Cromwell, led to the decline in the operating margin versus the prior year. Slide 13 covers our guidance for the year. We are reiterating our 2019 total Company guidance, which we shared in January. As a reminder, we are not going to update guidance unless we expect to be outside of the range. A few noteworthy comments on guidance for the total Company. On the top line, we expect sales growth to be driven by U.S. share gains of 300 basis points to 400 basis points for the year, and the continued strong growth of our endless assortment businesses. With regard to GP, we did not expect the Q1 U.S. gross profit favorability to repeat. U.S. price cost spread, including the impact of the remaining contract implementations, is still expected to be negative flat for the remainder of the year. From a profitability perspective, we continue to drive expense leverage at the total Company level and are confident in our operating margin guidance for the year. Now, I'll turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks Tom. Overall, our results in Q1 were largely in line with our expectations. In the U.S., we're confident in our ability to continue to gain share. We believe we have the right initiatives and the right people in place to drive increasing share of wallet with our existing customers and to attract new midsize customers. In Canada, the cost takeout is behind us and our focus is on stemming the volume loss. We believe we will achieve profitability in 2019. Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth, and we are driving strong expense leverage and are on track to achieve our productivity targets. Our strategic initiatives position us well for the long term. Now, I will open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David Manthey: The first question is on corporate expense, which seemed a little bit low this quarter. And I know there's a lot of factors that play in there, but can you talk about what impacted the first quarter? And then how we should think about the second quarter and the rest of the year if there's any anomalies to consider?
Thomas Okray: Yes, nothing really unusual. Corporate expense for the first quarter, anything that's lower is just due to the productivity initiatives that we have in place, but nothing significant that shouldn't repeat throughout the rest of the year.
David Manthey: And lately, I think, in terms of the medium customer growth, you've been mentioning you thought it could stabilize in the double-digit range. I'm not sure if that was revenues or volumes, but has your expectation for medium customer growth changed at all given this quarter?
Thomas Okray: Yes, I don't think our expectation has changed. I would say that as a reminder, we have a very low share of midsize customers. We have about a two share. There's a lot of room to grow. It's still relatively new to us in terms of the initiatives we've got focused on midsize customers. We continue to improve our ability to use marketing to drive new customer acquisition and penetration and our inside sales team continues to learn to get traction, and we're still understanding how to use pricing programs to drive growth. We still believe that we can hit that low double digit number over time and it's just a matter of how fast we can learn and grow.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Nigel Coe: Just wanted to clarify the comments on corporate expense. Again, I don't want to spend too much time on corporate expense, but, analyzing it's about $104 million in 1Q and you've been in the $140 million to $150 million range for the last couple of years. So just want to clarify that 1Q was a good base for the full year.
Thomas Okray: Yes. 1Q was a good base for the entire year. I mean, there's always some lumpiness in terms of corporate expense, but nothing unusual that's happening there.
Nigel Coe: And then, the other margins were down. You obviously called out Cromwell, and you called out investments. I'm just trying to delineate the impact between the two buckets. Can you maybe just call out what was more impactful? And then, just thinking about then on top of that, the minority line was down slightly, which implies a bit of margin pressure in Japan. Is that the case?
Thomas Okray: So, let me start with the investments in Zoro. Most of those investments are of the shape that we are giving that business more independence allowing them to add products on their own. They added about 200,000 SKUs in the quarter and there's about 800,000 SKUs in the pipeline. So they're really stepping on the accelerator. Those are significant in terms of the margin drag in the quarter. I would say, for us Cromwell is a bit of a wildcard, given what's going on with that market and what we're seeing. It was significant but we were a little less certain about how that's going to progress as the year plays out given all the uncertainty there. But both were significant, I think notable we continue to invest very heavily in getting Zoro some of the independence it needs to drive growth going forward.
Nigel Coe: Right. And no comments on MonotaRO?
Thomas Okray: I'm sorry. MonotaRO - comments on MonotaRO.
Donald Macpherson: MonotaRO business continues to perform well. There were some freight headwinds in the business, but we're pretty confident in the ability of that business to grow and to have very strong operating margins going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Graham: I want to maybe wrap the previous questions together with a little bit more on the guidance. We come out of the chute with our sales lower. You're saying your operating margin in the U.S. is probably going to be flattish for the rest of the year. We started Canada slow, and you're calling Cromwell a wildcard. I guess I'm just wondering you have indicated that even though you're not going to update during the year, do you think you're tracking toward the middle end? Is the high end of EPS guidance now out of reach? Because I think the only thing that's going against what I just said would be lower corporate.
Thomas Okray: I think - to be clear, I think we're only [three] [ph] months into the quarter. We still feel confident in our ability to gain share in the U.S., obviously with the U.S. earnings rate that's the biggest impact on both sales and earnings for the year. And then, the uncertainty around the market growth in the U.S. is a pretty big uncertainty. Obviously if the market bounce back and was significantly higher than two, we feel like we could hit the high end of the range. If it stays at the low end of that, that becomes hard to do.
Scott Graham: So you would argue right now that the change, the delta in the U.S. businesses are more because of the market or equally to that price cost? Is that fair when we look at the U.S. change?
Donald Macpherson: Well, the uncertainly is more around the market, and our ability to gain share we feel pretty confident in. We still feel confident in the profitability range for the U.S.
Scott Graham: Last question for me. I was under the impression that the midsize customer thinking was mid-teens, not double digit. Was I - am I wrong on that?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. When we talked in the fourth quarter, we talked about double-digit. Again, that'll depend a lot - in large on the market growth rates. But like I said, we're still learning. We've got a long way to - long runway to grow with midsize customers. We're still learning what's working and we're going to continue to make adjustments and we think we can continue to grow very strongly with midsize customers.
Scott Graham: So that 9 should convert into double digit the rest of the year is kind of what you're implying?
Donald Macpherson: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Evelyn Chow: This is actually Evelyn Chow from Goldman Sachs. Maybe just starting out, I noticed you - you have the U.S. price cost guide the same. But now that tariffs haven't really stepped up to the 25% rate, I just wanted to clarify, would you expect to maybe get some pricing back as we go through the year and that's partly what's driving the maintained U.S. price cost guidance?
Donald Macpherson: So, I would say that we continue to look at competitive market prices and we will continue to adjust. We would not expect necessarily the 1.5 price to stay at 1.5 as you see in our forecast going forward. But certainly the adjustments we're making are fairly minor, and they are based on just market competitiveness.
Evelyn Chow: And then, just returning to your comments on the demand environment being weaker than expected, when I actually look at your sales growth by customer vertical, only government really stands out having decelerated versus prior quarter. So is that really where you're seeing the most weakness in your end markets or does that maybe mask some underlying things that aren't coming out in just the total vertical growth?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So we saw some weakness in government as you highlight. I would say in light manufacturing, we've also seen some weakness in terms of market growth rates. And overall, it's been slightly less than our projections and obviously there's a lot of uncertainty if you look sort of at the forward-looking - what people are talking about there's anything from deceleration to acceleration coming in the back half of the year depending on what you're looking.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Merkel: So my first question is on the U.S. gross margin. Just want to make sure I heard the commentary right. So it sounds like the big change for the rest of the year is going to be the government contract price resetting there, so then price cost is going to turn to flat to maybe slightly down. Is that correct?
Donald Macpherson: No. The government contract has already started to be implemented so you saw a lot of that in the first quarter. There were modest price changes that we continue to make to be competitive with market, but we still feel like the original guide on GDP is the right guy for us and is effectively for the rest of the year. So that's all we're saying.
Ryan Merkel: So just you had a strong start, you just don't expect it to continue and you're sort of referencing of that.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Sequentially we normally see gross profit go down throughout the year. We have freight favorability, not sure that that will continue, we have some mix pickup as well. So, we're comfortable with the guide that we gave at the beginning of the year.
Ryan Merkel: And then, just turning to Canada, it sounds like you still expect improvement in volume through the year. Can you just run through the initiatives again? And then, more importantly, are you seeing any signs that these initiatives are gaining traction, because it looks like so far in the first quarter we're not seeing too much improvement, but could you help us out there?
Donald Macpherson: Well, we are seeing - what I'd say, we are seeing Ryan is, we're seeing the volume stabilize when we look at the run rate. So we've seen some benefit. I would say that the initiatives that are gaining traction for sure, we've added a number of products from the U.S. to the assortment, and that has gotten a nice pickup and we're starting to see some benefit from that. We expect to add as many as 100,000 items from the U.S. assortment that can help serve customers in Canada, so that's pretty exciting. We're seeing some sales force effectiveness work. We train all the sellers in the first quarter. We're starting to get some traction with what our sellers are doing in the marketplace, and that's important. I think the most important one is on the service side. We are starting to see some stabilization with service improvements, closing that many branches just frankly had a very significant impact on service in that market. And we're starting to see some of that stabilize. And so, we feel like those three are very, very important and we see those things will start to see the benefits we talked about.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray: Was hoping that you could comment on the impact of weather this quarter. And just I wanted to also point out that there was - you did not use it as an excuse. There were a number of distributors who complained about the weather. Your comment did not constitute an excuse, so appreciate that. So talk about the weather and quantify it if you could. And then also, was there any effects of pull forward where some demand might have been lost in the first quarter and pulled into the fourth quarter. Do you see any evidence of that?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So, on the second question, we don't see real evidence that there was pull-forward in the markets we serve and the way we serve them, we don't typically see that. We typically are the ones that are stocking items for customers. You don't see - you don't see customers pre-ordering typically. In terms of weather, I mean the weather events were fairly notable in the news. They had a minor impact and there is a lot of noise in any given quarter and we just - holiday timing was favorable, for Easter weather was a little negative, but none of that was really worth talking about in the quarter. So we didn't highlight that.
Deane Dray: Appreciate that. And I see that Tom provided more precision in volume and price this quarter in increments of 50 basis points. Is that going to be a go-forward practice?
Thomas Okray: Well, we're always looking to improve Deane and sharpen the pencil wherever we can. So, I appreciate you're noticing that.
Deane Dray: That's helpful. And then just last one. Did I notice that freight was less of a drag in the U.S.? You're not using spot market as often and spot rates were better. Maybe just some color there, and that's it for me.
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes. That's correct, Deane. We saw favorable economics in the overall freight market. We didn't use as much in terms of spot rates using more truck loads - full truck loads, all of that contributed to favorability in the U.S.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Barry: Just wanted to clarify on the comments about prices. It sounds like there are some places where prices in the market are going down. Is that the case and is that commodity driven or what's driving that?
Donald Macpherson: No, I wouldn't say that prices are going down. I would say, given the uncertainty around tariff, there was a lot of movement in prices. And prices are always adjusting in a minor way up and down, but we don't see any downward pressure on prices in general, that's not what we're seeing.
Robert Barry: And then, I guess, a question on the SG&A growth. So, in the adjusted model, only 2% in the quarter, just how should we think about that kind of going through the year? Maybe it doesn't sound low given the sales growth, but just in the context of the rest of the year, would you expect that to accelerate or do you think you can hold that kind of growth?
Thomas Okray: Yes. I mean, we continue to say we're going to grow SG&A at half while we grow sales, and that's what we're shooting for. We've got a good productivity culture in the company. So that's what we expect to tract to for the remainder of the year.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, I would also highlight that we've talked about sort of north of $50 million in terms of productivity, and we still fully expect to get that. So we feel like we're on track with what our plans.
Thomas Okray: Yes. One of the things that's really helping out Q1 is, if you look at the commitment that was made, $150 million to $210 million, if we look at what we've achieved today, we're already tracking at the high end of that. So that's certainly helping us in the SG&A area.
Robert Barry: Just lastly, could I clarify the comments on the large and medium growing? You talked, I think, about them growing - the growth accelerating on a two-year stack basis. Second quarter, do you also expect it to accelerate just on an annual basis?
Thomas Okray: So we talked about the two-year stack, and obviously last year I think we grew 20% in mid-sized customers. So we do expect to continue to see strong growth in the second quarter. We don't give quarterly guide, but our expectation is continue to see stronger.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzwinksi with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Just a follow-up on that last question on mid-sized customer. I cannot but notice that the convention changed a little bit in the slides where you're doing sales instead of volume now. So I appreciate the color on 8% volume growth in the quarter. But just thinking about that flip on price from negative to positive, how should we expect that to trend going forward? Is that something that should be a lot more stable going forward? Or if we had kind of a lack of acceleration here through the balance of the year, could that start going the other direction again?
Donald Macpherson: Now we feel like - we've talked about this before as we've made the pricing changes. We feel like we're competitive now. So we should be in a much more stable price and price cost environment that we've been in the last couple of years, and we would expect that to continue.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: And then, I think, related to Deane's earlier question about pull forward, I guess, maybe to look at it from a different direction, I think distributors in general added a bit more inventory in the fourth quarter, yourselves included. Is there any impact that we should think about in terms of the rebate outlook for 2019, especially in light of maybe a bit softer first quarter where you guys are de-stocking a little, better managing inventory a little bit more tightly, and you're not purchasing as much or is that something that you feel like you've contemplated in guidance already?
Donald Macpherson: So, just for everybody's benefit, we manage inventory typically to service levels. We did pull forward some inventory buy in the fourth quarter. Our service levels are very strong. Our expectation is that we'll continue to have very strong inventory levels. It's too early to comment on any impact to the rebate. And right now, I would say, there's very little chance that the rebate will be impacted by last year's pull forward.
Josh Pokrzwinksi: Got it. It's helpful.
Thomas Okray: It was a small full forward last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn: I wanted to follow-up on, I think, Evelyn's question, talked about medium and large customers doing some market-based pricing adjustments. So I think the prior view was, no more resets were needed and you're also seemingly saying very stable price cost environment. So just wanted to drill down into the fresher comments about some further market-based pricing adjustments.
Thomas Okray: Yes. Some of those will be up some of those will be down. We will always be adjusting our prices. We're always going to make sure that we're market competitive. The one thing I would highlight from this quarter was that given the expectation of tariff rates going in and what actually happened, there's probably more market-based adjustments. It's not a price strategy change. It's just making sure that they are competitive going forward.
Christopher Glynn: And then, the accounting change that comparison is just a one-off in the first quarter?
Thomas Okray: It is. We mentioned it in the call last year in Q1 as a tailwind. So we just - for completeness, I wanted to mention it as a headwind in Q1, then we're done with it.
Christopher Glynn: And then lastly, as you look at April playing out and your share strategies with the medium, etcetera, do you expect the second quarter top-line to be consistent with the full year range?
Donald Macpherson: Well, as we've said, our expectation is that we will continue to gain share at the rate we described. And our expectation is, the market growth will be between 1 and 4 as we described as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
Hamzah Mazari: My first question is just on the medium customer side. I know you've touched on sort of the two-year stack and growth in Q2, but any comments as to what the makeup of new customers is versus sort of a year ago? Question really is, are new customers adding more to growth than you've seen last year or wherever past comparison you want to use?
Thomas Okray: No, we continue to see strong growth from existing customers and growth from new customers. We're probably going to be talking about that moving forward, but we haven't given a specific percent. But we're pretty happy with both the new customer acquisition and the existing customers.
Hamzah Mazari: And just my follow-up question is just around M&A. Has the thought process that changed at all, D.G.? I mean most of your deals have been in Europe, and Canada the last few years. I think a U.S. deal was in safety a number of years ago. It seems like the market is still very fragmented on the FM side. There's potentially some chunkier deals in areas where you don't play on the FM side as much. Just any thoughts as to how you're thinking about the portfolio. I know you highlighted some issues at Cromwell, but just any broad-based thoughts on portfolio and M&A?
Donald Macpherson: So, I would say that our focus is squarely on growing organically, first. That is our primary focus. For all kinds of reasons, we have not had great success with M&A, and we feel like we're not afraid of M&A, but we are more focused on making sure we grow organically. We think that's best for our shareholders and for team members and for our customers. So that's our primary focus.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Volkmann: Just a couple of quick cleanups, if I may. The timing of the sales meeting this year, does that benefit the gross margin in the second quarter a little bit?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, it will. So we'll be adjusting that in Q2 as well.
Steve Volkmann: And then, the shipping and logistics costs being lower, that seems like given where pricing looks and futures, et cetera, that should be sustainable going forward, but it sounds like you're not really baking that in?
Donald Macpherson: It might be sustainable. At this point, we're sticking with our original guidance, and we certainly hope it continues. Can't disagree with your thought process there.
Steve Volkmann: And then, the final one. It just seems like you maybe were off to a little bit of a slow start on share repurchases, are you still thinking $450 million to $600 million?
Thomas Okray: Yes, we are. I'm not sure it was a slow start. It was 458,000 shares, $135 million. So, that was pretty sizable amount.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Dankert: I guess, first off, thinking about the other business, I guess, do run rate investment cost peak in the first quarter here or there's still kind of some additional initiatives that you guys are still keeping the pedal down and we'll see cost a bit more moving to 2Q and 3Q.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. We will continue to make investments in Zoro through most of this year. We would expect both of those investments to be made this year versus the future years.
Chris Dankert: Which is just on a run rate basis though first quarter versus second, fairly linear?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, similar I would say. But at a whole company level, not meaningfully different going forward.
Chris Dankert: And then, thinking about Canada, I mean, again, a lot of moving parts and a lot to parse through, but I mean is it fair to assume that we really won't see positive profitability till we get to the back half of the year here?
Donald Macpherson: We would expect the back half of the year to show profitable business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with G. Research. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Bergner: My principal question is, the level of outgrowth in Q1 was, I guess, 200 to 250 basis points in the U.S. based on the metrics you provided. Could you maybe comment on what limited the level of outgrowth this quarter such that you should be able to get back to the 300 to 400 basis point range as the year progresses?
Thomas Okray: So, I guess - I would start by saying, if you look sort of at a 20-year history, generally we would have said 200 to 250 basis points is pretty good. So, it wasn't a horrifically bad share gain quarter. That said, we feel like we need to grow faster than that. We feel like 300 to 400 is where we can grow in U.S. There's a number of changes we've made and just we've made really throughout the business, marketing in particular. We've talked about minor, minor pricing adjustments. We've talked about some of the work we're doing with our sales organization to accelerate growth. So, we are focused on making sure that we're taking the right actions to accelerate that 300 to 400 basis points.
Justin Bergner: Just secondly, in terms of the corporate costs, if we end up annualizing near that $25 million per quarter run rate, we'll get to a annual corporate cost that's meaningfully below prior years. And I was just trying to understand what is the enabling driver or drivers there that the track we're on?
Thomas Okray: Yes. I mean, it's just primarily productivity that - or productivity initiatives. No more color than that at this point.
Justin Bergner: But there's not anything funny in terms of stock options or pension or anything that's non-productivity-related that may explain part of the delta or expected delta?
Thomas Okray: I mean, there is one funny thing in terms of Fabory loan forgiveness in the first quarter, that - it's net neutral for the company, but it is showing up in Q1.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baughman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Baumann: Couple questions. Just a point of clarification on the U.S. segment daily sales growth, it was up 3.5% in the quarter, but then you had a slide upfront showing large up 5% and medium up 9%. So I'm just curious what's happening in other areas maybe that are making that headline a little bit lower.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. There's a couple of things happening there related to our specialty business and also our sourcing business. That's what's driving the reduction.
Patrick Baumann: You said sourcing business? What exactly do you mean by that?
Donald Macpherson: So, the way we look at mid-sized and large customer growth, it accounts for about 90% of the business. The 10% is just some noise in there and didn't see growth for some of our specialty business areas. And so that's what's driving the difference.
Patrick Baumann: And then just on advertising growth, last year was pretty - it was up almost 30%, which I guess the digital marketing initiatives you guys are undergoing. Just wanted to check in on how you guys are measuring effectiveness of the spend and if you expect to continue to grow that bucket at that kind of a growth rate this year.
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes. Our advertising spend is really in three buckets: one, the catalog, one is basically mass media, and the other is digital. We track all of those in terms of return on investment, and all are very strong. The catalog, while we don't produce many books is a very strong return on investment. We see radio as providing very strong returns and continue to see that. And then, with digital, we continue to see very strong returns, and that's fairly dynamic. We continue to shift in and out of specific channels. Overall, we see nice returns in the first quarter and we expect to see that moving forward.
Patrick Baumann: And then last one for me. Just back to the discussion on price/cost. You had said including contract implementations that price/cost was neutral in the first quarter, which I guess it means that it's positive excluding those contract implementations. And then, obviously, you've said that price will be adjusted to remain market competitive. So is then the right inference that there was a benefit related to the timing of price versus cost increases from tariffs in the first quarter, some of which you're going to get back through the year? Or am I misreading that?
Thomas Okray: No, that's correct.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'd like to turn the call back to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you for joining us this morning. Appreciate all the questions. I would just reiterate what we said in the opening. We continue to be very confident in the business in the U.S. We continue to be confident in our ability to gain share and to do so profitably. In Canada, we recognize the challenges there, but we do expect to stabilize that business. And given the actions we've taken around cost, that can be a very profitable growth business for us. We continue to be excited about the online business and the growth and profitability there. And we continue to do a nice job of managing SG&A while continuing to invest heavily in the business, we're going to continue to invest in the business. So, overall, we feel like we're off to a decent start for the year and confident going forward. Thanks for your time.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-24 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to W.W. Grainger’s Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q4 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today’s call with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of the slide presentation and in our Q4 press release which is available on our IR website. Looking at reported results for the year, we had adjustments resulting in $186 million impact to operating earnings and a $2.97 impact to EPS, adjustments included $139 million of non-cash impairment charges related to the Cromwell business and restructuring primarily related to Canada. This morning's call, we'll focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Now I'll turn it over to D.G. to discuss our 2018 performance. D.G., to you.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning. Thanks all of you for joining us this morning. 2018 was a strong year for Grainger, both in terms of our performance and in building the path for our long-term success. I am extremely proud of our team members and what they accomplished. Across the business, we remained laser-focused on enhancing our relationships with customers, which has put us in a better position to consistently gain share moving forward. Let's take a look at what we accomplished in 2018. We drove significant share gains across large and midsize customers in the U.S., as our value proposition continue to resonate on more relevant pricing. Our strong sales performance and favorable customer mix help drive gross margin performance that was better than expected for the year, and our diligence in managing costs resulted in significant operating expense leverage. We continue to enhance the customer experience with the Grainger brand in the U.S. to better search capabilities, best-in-class fulfillment, and by improving the end-to-end customer experience from order to delivery. Feedback from customers has been very strong and improving over the last two years. In Canada, the structural reset of the business is complete and we exited the year with a profitable fourth quarter. This has been a tough road for our team members in Canada. I want to acknowledge all the work that they and our team members in the U.S. put in to get Canada to profitability. We still have work ahead of us to stabilize volume performance, which I will talk about in a minute. Our single-channel businesses, mainly MonotaRO and Zoro, continued to drive profitable growth. Daily sales grew 23% for our single-channel model in 2018. For our international businesses, the portfolio performed well and contributed to operating margin expansion in the year. Across the business, we drove strong operating expense leverage. We achieved $130 million in cost savings and productivity, net of digital investments, which was above our target of $80 million to $120 million. For the year, operating expenses grew at half the rate of sales. Last January, we mentioned our plan to make incremental digital investments to accelerate progress with our offering in the U.S. Since then, we've combined our Gamut and grainger.com capabilities and made incremental investments in digital marketing. We also invested in our Zoro business to build out our endless assortment model. At our 2016 analysts meeting, we shared 2019 operating margin guidance of 12% to 13%, and we reiterated that target at early 2017 when we announced the acceleration of our pricing actions. We hit that target a year early with operating margin of 12% for the year, and we will build off this momentum moving forward. Now I want to remind everyone of the 2018 expectations we set for the U.S. business when we announced the acceleration of our move to market-based pricing. We said that we expected to achieve 6% to 8% annual volume growth in both 2018 and 2019 with expected market volume growth of 2% to 3% in each year. We expected price deflation of 2% and gross profit margin to decline approximately 120 basis points in 2018. Our results were better than that. U.S. volume grew 8% at the high-end of our guide versus U.S. market volume growth of about 3.5%. Price was flat and contributed to GP margin being down only 20 basis points after normalizing for the revenue recognition change. Price deflation related to the reset was offset by positive customer mix and market-based price increases. More importantly, we are having – not having to deeply discount infrequently purchased items as customers are more comfortable with our pricing. When I speak with customers and team members, I am hearing that price is no longer the primary part of the conversation, and the focus is squarely on how we can add value and help our customers solve problems. Our volume performance with both large and midsize customers remained strong throughout 2018. The fourth quarter was our first quarter having fully lapped the pricing changes, and this was our strongest quarter of results to-date on a two-year stack after adjusting for the holiday timing in December, which Tom will address later in this call. U.S. large customer volume grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 14% on a two-year stack. For the year, our U.S. large volume grew 12% on a two-year stack. U.S. midsize customer volume grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 42% on a two-year stack. For the year, our midsize customers grew 31% on a two-year stack. We are very happy with our performance in the U.S. in 2018. I want to spend a few minutes reminding everyone of our strategy and performance expectations going forward. Our strategy is to create value for customers through two business models. The first model is the high-touch, high-service model that serves customers with complex needs. Our Grainger U.S., Canada and Mexico businesses plus Cromwell and Fabory all fit within this model. The second model is the endless assortment model focused on customers with less complex needs, which we sometimes call the single-channel online model. In our high-touch, high-service model, we have three priorities for every business to create more value for our customers. Our first is to make sure that we have advantaged MRO solutions. That means understanding more about our products and our customers than anyone in building solutions that create value for our customers. Our second is differentiated sales and services. The battle in our space with complex customers largely occurs at their place of business. Our sellers and our service teams build relationships and provide services that customers value. And the third is our flawless order-to-cash process. Creating value for our customers means our order-to-cash process has to be the absolute best in our space. We are very strong here, and we have continued to make good progress. Our fourth priority with our high-touch, high-service model is to continue the turnaround in Canada. While we have made great progress, we have not yet met our expectations. With the cost structure changes behind us, we are now focused on stabilizing volume and driving profitable growth. Our team is working on expanding our product assortment and building a demand generation engine through improved website functionality, effective digital marketing and a high performing sales and services team. This is an attractive market where we are one of the largest players. Our long-term goal remains to achieve double-digit operating margin and consistent share gain for this business. In terms of the endless assortment model, we have several priorities. Given the success of our Zoro business coupled with our learnings from MonotaRO, we have made the decision to invest in Zoro to accelerate their product expansion efforts. This means investments in systems and people. In addition, we are leveraging our knowledge of MonotaRO to improve our marketing and analytics capability in our Zoro U.S. operation. These two changes will require some incremental investment in 2019 that will lower margins in the Zoro business. We are confident that these investments will improve both our growth rate and margins for Zoro in the next several years. Now executing against these priorities will put us in a position to accomplish the following in 2019 and beyond. We expect U.S. revenue to grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the market. We expect Canada volume to stabilize in 2019 and for profitable growth to follow up. We expect accelerated growth of the endless assortment model. We expect continued strong operating expense leverage, and the company expects to have operating margin expansion in 2019. Now I'll turn it over to Tom for detail on our 2018 performance and our 2019 guidance.
Thomas Okray: Thanks, D.G. I'll start with a recap of our 2018 total company-adjusted results then move to the fourth quarter results by segment. For the full-year, revenue was up 8%, 7% on a daily basis driven entirely by volume. Our normalized gross profit rate was down 20 basis points versus the prior year after adjusting for revenue recognition consistent with the U.S. businesses. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volume. For the full-year, operating expenses normalized for revenue recognition grew 3% on 8% revenue growth. Our strong sales growth, gross margin performance, and diligence in driving operating expense leverage resulted in incremental margin of 25%, operating earnings growth of 17%, and then operating margin of 12%, which is 100 basis points higher than the prior year. EPS grew 46% for the year. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing a 110% of net earnings after adjusting for the non-cash impairments for the Cromwell business. This result was flat to the prior year as positive earnings were offset by higher working capital, primarily driven by the timing of trade and other payables which we do not expect to repeat and the investment in inventory, including some opportunistic pre-buys. In addition, we returned $741 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Looking at the quarter, sales increased 5% including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 6%, 4% on a daily basis. Sales were comprised of volume growth of 4% and price inflation of 1%, partially offset by a 1% impact for holiday timing. Our normalized gross profit margin was down 20 basis points as margin growth in the U.S. and Canada was more than offset by gross profit declines in our other businesses, driven primarily by Cromwell and freight increases in Japan. Operating expenses normalized for revenue recognition increased 3%. The increase was driven by three factors. First, incremental digital investments including website enhancements and marketing spend for our U.S. business as well as investments in the growth of our Zoro business; second, incentive compensation versus the prior year reflecting our strong performance in 2018; and third, expenses which were one-time in nature and are not expected to repeat. Overall, operating earnings were up 10% resulting in operating margin of 11.2%, which is up 50 basis points from the prior year. Earnings per share increased 35% in the quarter versus the prior year due to strong operating performance in a lower tax rate. Looking at our other segment results. I'll start with our other businesses, which include our single-channel online model and our international businesses. Sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis due primarily to volume. Operating earnings increased 28% for the quarter with a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. In Canada, we finished the quarter profitably. Something we haven't been able to say for the past 11 quarters, sales were down 25% on a daily basis and down 22% daily in constant currency. We've made a lot of changes in a short period of time to improve the business and that has impacted volume more than we expected. The volume decline was offset by 8% price inflation. Moving to profit, our gross margin was up 160 basis points versus the prior year after normalizing for revenue recognition. Price inflation and lower freight were partially offset by product cost inflation and lapping favorable inventory adjustments in 2017 fourth quarter. Operating earnings increased 134% versus prior year. Operating margin improved 330 basis points driven by the initiatives from our turnaround plan. In the U.S., sales grew 6%, 5% on a daily basis and 6% after normalizing for holiday timing. In 2018, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fell on a Monday versus on a Sunday in 2017. We were open for business both days to serve our customers. However, revenue on those days was significantly lower than normal. That lower revenue effectively offset the benefit of the additional sales day. Excluding holiday timing, it was our strongest quarter on a two-year stack since announcing the pricing reset. We feel good about our sales momentum heading into 2019. Gross profit margin was up 20 basis points after normalizing for revenue recognition. As price inflation outpaced cost inflation in the quarter, higher supplier rebates on strong volume performance also contributed to favorable GP rate in the quarter. Operating expenses in the U.S. were up 8% after normalizing for revenue recognition in one additional payroll day. For the year, after normalizing for revenue recognition, operating expenses grew 5% and 8% revenue growth, providing significant operating leverage. However, there was some lumpiness throughout the year. In the quarter the lumpiness related to three main factors. First, we made planned incremental digital investments in the U.S. Second, we had higher incentive compensation versus the prior year reflecting strong performance in 2018. And the third piece was related to items that we do not expect to recur. Overall, operating earnings grew 5%, resulting in a 14.6% operating margin for the U.S., which was down 20 basis points in the quarter. Moving to our cost takeout and productivity targets, everything we do is focused on delivering value to our customers in the most efficient and effective way possible. Our goal was to drive $150 million to $210 million of cost savings and productivity, net of digital investments over a two-year period. In 2018, we achieved cost savings of $130 million and are now more than halfway to our two-year target. In the U.S. we realized $70 million in savings driven by a handful of items, including sales productivity from increased revenue per seller and onsite service efficiencies. Supply chain productivity as we practice continuous improvement in our DCs and completing the context center consolidation. For Canada, we realized $45 million in savings related to our turnaround efforts. And for our other businesses, we realized $15 million in savings, primarily related to closure of unprofitable businesses. Our 2019 cost takeout target is to achieve $65 million to $85 million in savings. Improving our cost structure has been and continues to be an important part of driving profitable growth in the future. We're confident in our ability to achieve our 2019 target. To recap 2018, our performance was strong throughout the year. We gained share, profitably, beat our expectations on operating margin and earnings per share, and achieved our 2019 operating margin target a year early. Now let's take a look at 2019 guidance. As a reminder, we changed our guidance philosophy in 2018. We now set guidance in January and plan to update it, if we expect to be materially outside the range. In 2019, we expect to deliver the following for the total company, 4% to 8.5% sales growth driven by continued share gains for the U.S. segment and the single channel businesses. Total company gross margin is expected to be down 60 basis points to flat versus the prior year. This is due to the timing of our contract pricing, negotiations and freight headwinds partially offset by price increases and customer mix. Operating margin is expected to improve 20 basis points to 100 basis points driven by strong sales growth and continued expense leverage. We’re investing in the areas that matter most to our customers. This includes incremental digital investments in the U.S. segment and investments to accelerate growth with Zoro. Our goal is to drive 2019 incremental margin of 20% to 25%. Finally, we expect earnings per share growth of 2% to 12%. We expect to have a higher tax rate in 2019 versus the prior year due to the wind down of our clean energy investment at the end of 2018. As a result, there will be no EPS benefit due to clean energy in 2019. We have also not assumed any stock-based compensation impact to the tax rate in 2019, which helps the tax rate in 2018. Moving to our segment level projections for 2019, in the U.S. segment, we expect operating margin of 15.5% to 16.1% driven by expense leverage on strong sales growth, partially offset by gross profit margin headwinds. U.S. revenue growth is expected to be driven by customer acquisition and increasing share of wallet. We continue to expect this business to grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the market with expected market growth of approximately 1% to 4%, which includes 1% of price. Moving to gross profit margin, U.S. GP rate is expected to be down slightly to flat, due to a few factors. First, we expect to pass through both general and tariff for related cost inflation. In an inflationary environment, we feel confident in our ability to pass-through price. Second, increased freight costs. We have strategic partnerships with freight carriers that significantly mitigated our exposure to increases in 2018. We continue to effectively manage freight costs and expect 2019 freight increases to be materially less than the market. Finally, we will complete the contract negotiations related to the pricing reset in 2019. We have approximately 10% of large contract revenue to go. In Canada, we expect operating margin of 1% to 5%. Our 2018 volume performance was below expectations. And as a result, our operating margin guide for 2019 is slightly lower than our original target. As D.G. mentioned, most of the cost structure initiatives are behind us and we are now focused on stabilizing volume and driving profitable growth. Our 2019 actions will include expanding our product assortment, including leveraging the U.S. assortment where it makes sense. Improving our digital capabilities, including website functionality and online marketing, and building a high performing sales and service team, Canada is an attractive market for Grainger and we're committed to getting this business to long-term profitable growth. For other businesses, we expect 6% to 8% operating margin, single channel businesses operating margin growth is expected to slow due to investments in product expansion and technology to support the growth of our endless and assortment model. As we commented earlier, we're confident these investments will improve both our growth rate and margins for Zoro over the next several years. On Slide 20, we outlined our cash flow projection. In 2018 we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. In 2019, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion driven by strong earnings growth and working capital improvements. We plan to use $300 million to $350 million of our cash to reinvest in the business. This includes investment in a DC to support the growth of MonotaRO. We will also make investments to support the growth of our Zoro business, improve our IT infrastructure, and enhance our U.S. distribution center network. Development of our Louisville, DC is progressing as planned and we are on track to start outbound shipping in early 2020. We expect to use $450 million to $600 million for share repurchases, which reflects confidence in our strategy going forward. The remainder will be used for dividends. Now I'll turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. We are very pleased with our performance in 2018. More importantly, we are excited about the actions we've taken to position us for success moving forward. We look forward to maintaining this momentum in 2019 and beyond. Now we will open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Merkel: Great. Thanks. So first of all, U.S. EBIT margin guidance for 2019, up 10 basis points at the midpoint. I guess two-part question. First, just to clarify your thinking about flat gross margins, and then, it is offset by investment. Is that why there's not more margin expansion? And then, well, I'll let you answer that then I’ll ask the second part.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks, Ryan. This is D.G. So a couple things. One is on the gross profit line. Our expectation is that we will be down 60 basis points to flat for the year. There's a couple things going on there. One is, we talked about being roughly flat in 2019 before. What has happened is some of our contracts have not actually been implemented yet, so we got some benefit in 2018 and that benefit will turn into a slight negative in 2019. So at the midpoint, we're slightly down. We still expect to get strong operating leverage in the year. We are making some additional investments in digital capability certainly, but we still expect to get strong operating leverage and slightly down GP at the midpoint and that's because of that contract timing.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, got it. All right. And then are we through some of these one-off items, sticking with U.S. EBIT margin in the fourth quarter? I guess what I'm asking is once we get into first quarter 2019, does year-over-year operating margins in the U.S. start to expand again? Or is this something that might be more of a second half progression?
Thomas Okray: Yes. Let me take this. This is Tom. As we alluded to in our prepared remarks, there's three main items there. Let me give you a little bit more granularity to help you size that. For the U.S. segment in Q4, SG&A expenses grew 6%. We said 5%. That's related to the additional payday. If you normalize for three buckets, which is variable compensation, the additional payroll day and items that aren't expected to recur, the 6% increase actually goes to flat or 9% associated with revenue recognition, goes to a 3% increase. This clearly had a material impact on our Q4 U.S. segment on the operating margin, and we don't expect this profile to be representative going forward.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's helpful.
Donald Macpherson: Who's next?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David Manthey: Thank you. Dramatic pause there. Hi, guys, good morning. First off, as it relates to your outlook, it appears to contemplate something of a soft landing. Could you just talk about the 1% to 4% market growth? What of that do you assume is price versus volume for the market? And then are you assuming that Grainger is going to be in the same ballpark of maybe a low single-digit growth rate of price?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So we have 1% price in there. We have volume of 0% to 3%. We would expect to be somewhere in that ballpark generally. So yes, that's what we've embedded in there. And it is a bit of a soft landing. We don't have any. We've got the same economic advisors that everybody else does and so we're hearing the same things you are. So that's where we're at right now.
David Manthey: Okay. Sounds good, D.G. And then on these investments in the digital in the Other Businesses, including Zoro, could you talk about the nature of those investments? What broadly, what type of investments those are? And then if you could talk about maybe by how much those investments depressed the EBIT margin forecast that you've given us?
Donald Macpherson: Sure. So the investments are largely – if you think about our business in MonotaRO which has been so successful. They now have 20 million items on their website and we are making investments in Zoro to be able to expand our offering dramatically over the next several years. Those investments are in systems and people to make sure that we can be successful in doing that. We're also investing in analytics capabilities and marketing capabilities and really taking the lessons we've learned from MonotaRO to go ahead and push that. Those investments are significant for Zoro. The business will remain profitable through the transition and most of those investments will be done by the end of the year. So we should be in better shape going into 2020 from a margin perspective, but we expect several hundred basis points or more to be down relative to where we were this year.
David Manthey: Sounds good. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a little bit about the sequential momentum and the medium strategy. In terms of your path to get back above 5% share long-term, obviously good momentum right now. Wondering if there are any market penetration levers that are just getting started there and how that compounding sensitivity is shaping up? You're introducing new levers at Zoro, sounds interesting. How would you describe how you sustain the compounding at the medium?
Donald Macpherson: Sure. So with midsize customers, and we've talked about some of this before. We've seen growth both with existing customers. We've reengaged some last customers and we've acquired new customers. I would say the new customer acquisition has been very solid over the last quarter, and we expect that to continue. So most of that is acquiring new customers digitally and then getting – building a relationship with those customers. We still have a fairly small customer file with midsize customers relative to the entire universe. So with the Grainger brand, midsize customers, we expect consistent strong growth over the next couple of years at a minimum. And a lot of that's going to be new customer acquisition in addition to some of the existing customer growth.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Great. And I just want to get a better understanding of the impact of the contract negotiations on U.S. gross margin outlook because the U.S. large revenue base about 80% of the segment and you're talking about 10% of those, so maybe 8% of the U.S. segment. It doesn't seem like that approach is the magnitude of mix that would have such a pronounced impact on your gross margin outlook given volume and mix should be good guys?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So it actually does approach the number that we're talking about, if – that's going to be in the 10s of basis points of impact for next year. So if we're down 60 to flat if that were not the case, we’d be sort of centered – much closer to zero for next year. So that's the impact and a lot of this is just implementation of contracts that are already signed. And in particular, one very, very large contract that that still needs to be implemented fully.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Volkmann: Hi, good morning. I wonder if we could go back to the midsize sort of large customer breakdown and obviously the midsize growing a lot faster, great to see that. I assume that has some positive margin implications and I'm curious if you could ballpark sort of how much tailwind that gives you and then sort of what's offsetting that to leave us with sort of flat to down and gross margin?
Donald Macpherson: Yes, I mean like we said it's an impact. It's certainly 10 basis points to 20 basis points roughly have an impact in terms of mix that we've seen if we continue to grow midsize customers much faster than large. So it's a small impact, but a real one.
Stephen Volkmann: Okay. All right, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just with respect to – I think you laid in a little bit of extra inventory and I'm curious if that benefits maybe the first half of 2019, I'm sort of a price cost basis?
Thomas Okray: Yes. We added inventory as you saw including some opportunistic pre-buys that we made in Q4, preparing us for what we expect to be strong growth in 2019.
Stephen Volkmann: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.
Mario Cortellacci: Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Actually, just kind of hitting on the medium customers again. I mean, could you walk us through what kind of market share you think you guys could get in the medium customers? And maybe you could talk about how your go-to-market or your sales strategy is different from that of large customers or maybe it's the same?
Donald Macpherson: No, it's fairly significantly different. So we have less than 2% market share today. At our peak, we had significantly more than that. Without contemplating a specific number, we know we've got a lot of runway with midsize customers. In terms of how we go-to-market, we acquire customers typically digitally with the midsized customer group. We then develop a relationship in some cases that will stay digital and some cases that becomes an inside seller relationship where there will be someone on the phone that talks to them on a consistent basis. We provide significant technical product support to that group, which is a big value to that group. And what we find is that those customers really value what Grainger has to offer the technical product support, the products themselves and the quality of the products, and the fulfillment all mean a whole lot to that that midsize customer group. So we're seeing great response as we acquire new customers and build those relationships.
Mario Cortellacci: Great. And just a quick follow-up. I mean, could you talk about, I guess, how you guys differ from Amazon industrial supply in your distribution or your products or even your service levels, and maybe where you guys bump up with them head-to-head and – just competition-wise?
Donald Macpherson: So I'm assuming you're talking about Amazon business, is that…?
Mario Cortellacci: Yes.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. Okay. Yes, so I would say that we are skewed a very much more industrial. We developed personal relationships with customers. We provide services with customers. We provide onsite services with customers. We have sellers. Our fulfillment is designed to make sure that we get complete orders to customers next day. So our buildings are completely different design. I would say on almost every dimension we are different. And so without going into too much detail on the call, we've built our machine to be able to really be very attractive to industrial businesses and that's our customer base and that's what we're trying to gauge here with.
Mario Cortellacci: Gotcha. Thank you so much.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. 
Patrick Baumann: Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. I just had a couple of questions here. First one is just an SG&A growth. The profile for 2019 sounds pretty similar to what you did in 2018? Just curious as you look beyond 2019, what this might look like on more of a normalized basis after you're through with all your costs savings plans?
Donald Macpherson: So I would just say that we have – we think built a muscle in a process to make sure that we're very disciplined with SG&A going forward. Our expectation is that we will continue to get SG&A leverage to 2020 and beyond. So without talking about specific numbers, our expectation is that the process we built, the way we look at our expenses, the way we drive improvement throughout the business, efficiency and effectiveness will continue to do to perform well going forward.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. On Zoro, what did the business grow in the quarter and for the year? And just curious if you could provide some context on what's driving the change in kind of the assortment strategy there? Is the growth kind of slowing down a little bit? Or you guys just…
Donald Macpherson: Yes. The Zoro business continued to grow very, very strongly throughout the year. If you look at the history of our business in Japan, about this time in the history, they really stepped on the accelerator with the assortment strategy, and we're at the point now where creating some real differentiation with the Zoro business in the marketplace. We think is important and we think we've got an opportunity to do that based on what we've learned. And so we're investing for the future. It doesn't mean that have seen slower growth at Zoro at this point.
Patrick Baumann: Got it. And then last one just really quick on restructuring expense for 2019, do you guys expect you’re restructuring? I haven’t seen anything on the slides here or the press release?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. We expect our restructuring expenses obviously to go down with most of the heavy lifting in U.S. and in Canada behind us, so it will be significantly less than we've seen in the past couple of years.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. Thanks. Good luck guys.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Thomas Okray: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Barry: Hey guys. Good morning.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Thomas Okray: Good morning.
Robert Barry: I apologize, I was dropped from the call for the first couple of questions, so if you touched on this already, we can skip it. But did you talk about what you've assumed in the guide vis-à-vis the tariffs versus what you outlined at 3Q? Any change there?
Thomas Okray: No change at all. And just to clarify our contemplation in the guide, assume the 10% tariff being at 25%, so that's already included in the guide.
Robert Barry: Got it. So if it stays at 10% and there'd be some upside there, I guess?
Thomas Okray: Correct.
Donald Macpherson: Yes.
Robert Barry: Got it. And then just wanted to follow-up on the question about – I think there was a question about the U.S. operating margin. I think it's implied about flattish, is that right? And I'm just curious what's driving that especially because it sounds like you'll be lapping some headwinds in 3Q and 4Q that seemed to be non-recurring?
Thomas Okray: You're referring to the guide for 2019 for the U.S. segment?
Robert Barry: Yes, the 15.5% to 16.1%, I think it came in at 15.7% for the year.
Thomas Okray: Yes. Sure. As D.G. mentioned earlier, maybe you had dropped off the call. Our GP, we expect to be flat to minus 60 down and with the big impact there being freight as well as the contracts, which still have to be closed for this year are implemented for this year. So yes, we've got opportunity on the high-end to grow 100 bps in terms of operating margin, but we're being prudent on the low-end given the uncertainty we see in terms of the freight issues as well as the overall economic environment.
Robert Barry: Got it. Just finally, what is the messaging on the end market demand in your momentum? I mean the 4% adjusted in December, it looks like a deceleration and I think the 4Q overall is the deceleration versus recent quarters. Just any color on what you're seeing out there from the demand perspective? Thanks.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. I'd point to a couple of things. One is, certainly the market growth was still reasonably strong in the fourth quarter, a little less than it was in Q2 and Q3 it appears. That's said, we think our performance was very similar on a comparison basis to the market in the fourth quarter. We talked a little bit about the last week of the year being very slow. But fortunately people showed up, back up to work to start the year. And so our expectation is that there's going to be very modest growth at this point. That's our expectation and we will continue to gain share at a similar pace to what we've done.
Robert Barry: Got it. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good Morning. D.G., could you maybe just kind of go back to your comments on tariffs, because you expressed confidence in your ability to price through both inflation and tabs. So if we end up with a 10% or 0% on less 3% compared to 25 in your plan. Should we assume that's a wash with pricing a little less than you would otherwise have gone with?
Donald Macpherson: Nigel, I think your question is what happen is with the tariffs stay at – go back to 10%. Is that your question?
Nigel Coe: Yes. And then what pricing not be as great as it would have otherwise have been?
Donald Macpherson: Over time that would be the case, I mean typically when if that were to happen there would be some legs. So there might be some benefit during that light period is what we typically have seen historically, but generally our philosophy is we want to make sure we're pricing to market and getting the best cost we can. And so presumably the market price would adjust adjusted some point in the future as well.
Nigel Coe: Okay. And then I hate to ask the obvious question, but can you maybe just touch on your government sales obviously still very strong through 4Q, but with the shutdown, how would that tracking maybe just remind us in terms of your exposure to state versus federal and the proportion of sales.
Donald Macpherson: Yes, great. So we're about 70% stay local about 30% federal. The federal business for us tends to SKU industrial and by that we mean things like the military. Some of those are funded. So far I would say the impact on us has been certainly it's calculable, but not big. It's a small impact for us right now. I would say, we get a little more concerned if the shutdown goes longer because it has knock on effects to other things. But for us the shutdown in its current form, we don't have huge volume with customers that are shutdown right now. So it's a pretty small impact on us so far. That's it. Obviously if it goes longer we get, we get concerned about some other things.
Nigel Coe: And then total governments about 14% of your sales
Donald Macpherson: Yes. That's about right.
Nigel Coe: Great. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Dankert: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question here.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Christopher Dankert: I guess just to take another slice at medium, kind of what gives you confidence in maintaining it looks like medium – mid-teens growth in that business. I mean is – anything you could share with us, whether it's your number of new customer acquisitions, new users’ size? Any other metrics we can see as far as giving you confidence in maintaining that growth rate?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. We haven't shared this specific. I would say that the new customer acquisition rate gives us confidence. I would say that that the lapse customer return rate continues to be strong. We continue to get customers who have been customers before. And just our numbers through the fourth quarter give us confidence that there's still a lot of momentum to go as we've lapped the price decreases.
Christopher Dankert: Got it, got it. And then thinking about productivity and cost savings beyond 2019 here, obviously you already commented on Zoro in the single channel kind of getting a little bit improvement from lower investment. I guess any other way of think about normalized incremental margins for the U.S. or the other businesses here?
Donald Macpherson: I'm sorry. You're talking about in 2019 or beyond 2019?
Christopher Dankert: Beyond, once we kind a get the cost cuts.
Donald Macpherson: Yes. So our expectation has been that we will grow expenses and about half the rate we grow sales in that that's been kind of our expectation. We don't see anything that would change that at this point going forward. We still feel like we've got a lot of opportunity to improve our cost structure go forward.
Christopher Dankert: Understood. Thanks guys.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Evelyn Chow with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Evelyn Chow: Good morning, guys. I wanted to touch on Canada for a moment. I know Tom when we met back in November. You had said there's some potential green shoots in the volume inflection in that business. Could you just give us an update on what you're seeing on the ground and how the market is progressing and any line of sight you have into your own inflection?
Thomas Okray: Just to clarify, we had a really hard reset of that business. I think when you look at the cost, takeout numbers, they're bigger than we had talked about taking and as we got into it, we felt like we needed to reset, pretty much everything, everything in the business. That has had a fairly significant impact on volume in the business. We are now doing some things to improve the customer experience that we think are going to help us grow going forward, adding products to the assortment. Again, we're training our sellers and really working on getting a high performing sales and services team in that business. Our fulfillment performance is actually pretty good. We're hearing from customers’ that is pretty good and we're starting to see a few wins for the first time in a long time. There, I think what we're starting to get some volume. Now it's going to take a while. The reality is this was a very hard reset and that's why we're backing off of the margin targets for 2019 because it's going to take a little bit longer than we had hoped. It's been a very complicated and challenging process. I would say we're still confident in the underlying market. The market has been performing reasonably well. We have a business that’s sort of separate out there that we know has been performing reasonably well, so the market has been growing, and most of this has been us resetting that business.
Evelyn Chow: That makes sense. And then thanks for framing the gross margin guidance with your comments and contract negotiations and tariffs. It sounds like freight is the other big piece of that, so any sense of the magnitude that's baked into the guide currently?
Donald Macpherson: Well, obviously freight market has been tight. I think I make a lot of the uncertainty on where we land probably is freight going into the year, whether or not that market stays is tighter, gets tighter or gets looser. It builds in some of the uncertainty. We feel like we are effectively managing freight. We feel like we've got a really good process to improve both our operational freight costs, and our overall freight cost. So I would say its modest impact, but it is an impact.
Evelyn Chow: Thank you, guys.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Cieslak: Hey, good morning, guys. My first question, I think you'd mentioned that supplier rebates had a positive impact on your gross margins within the U.S. business in 2018. Is there any way you could maybe quantify that or provide some directional color of how much of an impact that was. And then what is the 2019 guidance for your gross margins in the U.S. segment assume for the supplier, rebate dynamics, certainly relative to what you guys saw in 2018?
Donald Macpherson: So our supplier rebates are largely based on volume. We don't disclose how much of what the magnitude of those are. And I would say their supplier rebates for 2019 bake in, an assumption around our volume, which you see in there. So they're linked to the revenue expectations for the business.
Ryan Cieslak: Is it fair to say D.G., though that the supplier rebate benefit is smaller than what you saw in 2018?
Donald Macpherson: To the extent that our volume is slightly smaller, that would be fair to say.
Ryan Cieslak: And then when you think about the ability to maintain the medium size customer growth, I know this question was asked a couple of different ways, but is there anything specific that you guys are going to do differently this year as it relates to digital actions or some sort of investments that you're making that would potentially be a catalyst or recapitalize sort of where the level is? Or are you saying basically you're seeing good momentum and you expect that momentum to continue here into 2019?
Donald Macpherson: I think it's both. We're seeing good momentum and we're actually increasing our digital investments to acquire more customers. So we are doing, but that's part of the digital investment that Tom talked about earlier.
Ryan Cieslak: Okay. Appreciate it guys.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Deane Dray: I just want to make sure I understand how you could get to the higher end of your 2019 sales guidance. Just from what I see you coming out of the fourth quarter, exit rate is a bit softer. You're baking in some soft landing assumptions here. Maybe we'll see how long the government shutdown pinches you, at least for the first quarter. But based upon that, where do you get an acceleration of growth? And might you have to go and consider further price cuts?
Donald Macpherson: Well, first of all, let me adjust the price cut issue first. Our prices are competitive from a market base perspective, so that – no is the answer to that question. Our perspective is we don't actually see a shift in the share gain we have. So the way you think about it is if the market growth rate is at the top end of what we're saying, then we feel like we will be at the top end of that that revenue perspective. And so there's all kinds of opinions out there about what happens with market activity. Some of them actually have a little bit of a slowdown now and acceleration later. I don't know whether any of that's true, but certainly there are projections out there that are at the top end of our range. If that comes through, then we will be the top end of our sales range.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then for Tom, just some color around the tax for the fourth quarter, a lot lower. We've heard some companies discuss further clarity on tax reform? Was there any dynamic there? And what was it that drove the decision to exit your clean energy tax program?
Thomas Okray: Yes. I mean, first of all on the tax rate, if you put in the stock-based compensation, then that puts us squarely at the low-end of our guide. So that's the story on that. In terms of exiting the clean energy, it was a nice $0.09 per share pickup for this year and just made the decision that we're going to conclude it.
Deane Dray: So that was at your discretion it's not that the program went away.
Thomas Okray: That's correct.
Deane Dray: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Justin Bergner with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Bergner: Good morning, D.G. Good morning, Tom.
Thomas Okray: Good morning.
Justin Bergner: As you look at sort of your outgrowth going forward and I realized only guiding to 2019 today, but just generally speaking, is it going to shift more towards medium customers driving your outgrowth? I know that large customers have also been a strong contributor, but as meaning customers become a larger base, is that going to become a larger contributor to your outgrowth? Or is it going to stay large contribution as well?
Donald Macpherson: Over the next several years, we expect midsize customers to go faster than large, but we expect the dollar impact of large customer growth to be much higher given that the base of large customer revenue. So we don't feel like we are close to maxed out with any customer segment. We feel like we have strong opportunity really with our customer groups, but we would expect the percentage growth with midsize customers to be higher this year, next year, probably for the next three years at a minimum.
Justin Bergner: Okay. Thank you. And then I'm surprised that price is only modeled or expected to be 100 basis points. I mean, help me understand why all sort of the inflationary and tariff headwinds don't require greater than 1% price to sort of keep up with cost pressures? 
Thomas Okray: Yes. Just to clarify, in the 1% to 4% market growth, we've got 1% is assumed in that, so it'd be 0% to 3% in terms of volume. With respect to our own range in our guide, we've got 1% to 2%.
Justin Bergner: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning.
Donald Macpherson: Good morning.
Scott Graham: Similar to – I think it was a question at the top about the 2019 guidance range for the U.S. I guess, I was expecting to hear a tinge of conservatism, and I don't think I'm hearing that from you all. And if I'm wrong in that, please let me know. And by extension, that does mean that the Other Businesses, that goal of 6% to 8% with a midpoint of 7%, that's roughly 100 basis points on a 6% margin from 2018 is a pretty big needle move on a business whose margins have really not moved even though we've kind of targeted higher. So it does seem that if in fact, the U.S. margin range is kind of going to be what it's going to be, that there's a lot of reliance in an area where we haven't seen a lot of success in reaching to a higher level of margin. Can you maybe give us what the drivers are behind that business to give us some comfort on that?
Donald Macpherson: Sure. So just to be clear, we have seen pretty significant margin expansion in our other category over the last couple of years. And what gives us more confidence as we've actually closed some unprofitable businesses. That portfolio is now much more squarely the tune to the online model and the margins there are much higher than that 6% in aggregate. So as we go forward, we would expect to have continued margin expansion even with the investments in Zoro that we're going to make largely just the math of having a much stronger portfolio at this point. So we expect that. I would also say, we do expect slight margin expansion in the U.S., although it's modest at least for the guide.
Scott Graham: Okay. We are talking to the as reported 6%, right? Not the sort of stripped down version, right?
Donald Macpherson: I’m not sure. Scott, I’m not sure.
Scott Graham: In other words, the business is – I think you were referring – they're through your other, your inter segment, you run some things that could potentially change the dynamic of the Other Businesses margin. We are talking about the Other Businesses margin as reported, right?
Donald Macpherson: Sure, yes. Absolutely, absolutely we are. Yes.
Scott Graham: Okay. Secondly, I know it was some time ago that you set forth your 2019 margin goals. Any reason why now that we're in 2019, we don't maybe take a look at a couple of years and kind of go to higher aspirations?
Donald Macpherson: Well, I mean I would assume that we have higher aspirations. We have not – right now we're just talking about 2019. If we decide to put out margin guidance going forward, we would do that separately. But yes, I mean obviously we don't – we're not saying that we're going to stop.
Scott Graham: No. For sure, I would definitely be hearing that message. Last question is this, the slowdown that we maybe saw in the fourth quarter, could you maybe give us a little bit of a feel for the tone of business in January so far?
Donald Macpherson: Well, like I said, I mean it was – we're happy to see that people came back to work in January and we feel good about our ability to gain share in any market. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty. Most of that is uncertainty around things that we don't control and I don't think we know where to land. I would say that the fourth quarter up until sort of the last week of December, things were very, very, very good. And so the slowdown was a very, very short period of time. And so we were looking to see if people came back to work, and they did, which is good.
Scott Graham: Understood. Thanks.
Donald Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.
John Inch: D.G., I want to ask you just about the national accounts. If you go back prior to your pricing initiatives, they would traditionally drag gross margins, and I'm curious if we were to normalize for these contracts sort of implementation the 10%, are they still relatively dragging year-over-year on the trend? Or are they flat, up? Like what's going on there?
Donald Macpherson: So are you asking about – I think you're asking the question on national account. Are their GPs flat year-over-year? Or are you talking about their impact on the company's GP?
John Inch: Yes. Are they flat year-over-year? And just – I guess if were to normalize for the contracts…
Donald Macpherson: Yes. With the exception of the contract resets that we've talked about, the answer is, yes. They're pretty stable.
John Inch: They are pretty stable. Okay.
Donald Macpherson: Yes.
John Inch: And that's a change right, from what…
Donald Macpherson: Yes. It is actually post reset. What we've seen with all of our large customers is a bit of an opportunity to simplify pricing. They're more willing to buy spot-buys at the prices that they see because they're competitive, and so that’s simplifying things as well.
John Inch: Okay. The other question I had is, it goes back to tariffs. If the tariffs are rolled back or we actually achieve a trade deal, I mean what actually happens to pricing? Does pricing have to get reversed? And how do you – look, how do you guys think about this dynamic over the next few months?
Donald Macpherson: Well, so for us we actually separate price cost in terms of how we think about it. We're pricing to the market, and we try to get the best cost we can. I think I mentioned this before, typically when there's been things like that that have happened, price will change, but there maybe some lag. So there might be some period where you have some short-term benefit. Ultimately you would expect if tariffs will roll back, that prices would eventually sort of moderate. But typically we get some period of benefit then.
John Inch: You mean, in Grainger prices moderate, so you would actually have to take your list prices down? Is that – or your contract pricing down or whatever?
Donald Macpherson: Well, so over time the market price will change, and we will be aligned in the market price.
John Inch: Understood. Just lastly, your Zoro investments, I think you said that you were expanding your SKUs. What are the SKUs now? And how much do they expand? And I'm curious, is there an impact if Zoro gets bigger with respect to potentially cannibalizing medium accounts or do you really think they can sort of stick to discrete tracks?
Donald Macpherson: Yes. They're pretty discrete today. There is very little cannibalization. Actually, today, there's several million SKUs that Zoro has. We will go to double-digit million SKUs eventually. Doing that actually creates a little bit more differentiation between a Grainger model, which is very industrial, very MRO-focused versus what Zoro has. And we feel that that will actually mitigate cannibalization to some degree as well. But obviously there's some, but it's very minimal today.
John Inch: Got it. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Donald Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to D.G. Macpherson for closing comments.
Donald Macpherson: All right. Thanks everyone again for joining us. I would just reiterate a couple of points. One is we're very happy with the performance that we had in 2018. I think we've focused on the right things. Our results were strong and we've got a lot of momentum heading into the future. So I really appreciate all your time, and I hope you are off to a great new year. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger’s Q3 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of the slide presentation and in our Q3 press release. Both are available on our IR website. D.G. will cover performance for the quarter, and Tom will go deeper into our financials including segment results. After that, we will open the call for questions. D. G., to you.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you, Irene. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. So we had another solid quarter. Demand remained very strong in the third quarter and we are continuing to gain share. In the US, as we lapped our August 2017 pricing changes, we are encouraged with our volume growth of 8%, which significantly outpaced the market. We are continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and midsize customers now that we have removed pricing as a barrier. We continue to grow faster in more profitable parts of the business, notably with our midsize customers. In addition, gross margin when normalized for the revenue recognition accounting change, and operating margin, were both favorable to prior year. In Canada, the execution of our turnaround continues to make progress and is on schedule. We still expect to exit the year at a profitable run rate. Our single channel online businesses, namely, MonotaRO and Zoro, had strong growth and profitability. We recorded a non-cash impairment for Cromwell in the UK, reflecting slower growth than planned at acquisition. The overall international businesses are profitable with the exception of the impairment.  We believe that our current exposure to tariffs is well understood and effectively managed. Tom will address tariffs later in the presentation. I would also mention two other things. One, we had a very strong customer satisfaction rating in the US this quarter, actually the strongest we’ve seen under the current methodology. And also with Hurricane Michael making landfall last week, I want to note that all of our people are safe and our team members are doing a great job responding to the event as they always do. With that, let’s take a look at our results. Third quarter 2018 reported results contained restructuring charges of $142 million and a $2.37 impact to EPS. In the quarter, we took a non-cash impairment of $139 million related to our Cromwell business. In 2015, we described to you the expected benefits of the acquisition, based on the strength of the core Cromwell business, the ability to build the online model off of that core and the potential in the UK market. Many of these benefits still exist. However, a few things have changed since the decision. First, Brexit occurred within a year of acquisition and the market slumped. And the uncertainty surrounding Brexit as it gets closer to being executed forces us to take our growth projections lower. Second, the cost of capital is higher now. These two structural issues explain the majority of reduction in valuation. In addition, our strategy included building an online model with the Cromwell name. In reality, this approach created customer conflict with the core business. We adjusted our approach and re-launched the online model under the Zoro name about a year ago. The opportunity with Zoro is large and compelling with very strong early signals in the market. But the late start of Zoro and the lower growth rate given market conditions impacted current valuation. While it’s still early days, we do believe the UK is an attractive place for Grainger to play. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Total company sales in the quarter were up 7%, that included 7% in volume, 1% in price and a headwind due to foreign exchange and hurricane comparisons of 1%. This is the first quarter in 2018 with a foreign exchange headwind. Normalizing for foreign exchange and hurricanes, our sales increased over 8%. Our normalized GP rate was flat to the prior year after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change which we discussed earlier. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volume. This all lead to operating earnings growth of 15% in the quarter and an operating margin that was 80 basis points higher than the prior year. Now, I’ll turn it over to Tom for additional detail, including our segment results.
Tom Okray: Thanks, D. G. I’ll cover our other business results first. As a reminder, other businesses include our single channel online model and our international businesses. Sales for these businesses were strong, up 13% in the quarter; 14% driven by price and volume, partially offset by a 1% reduction related to foreign exchange. Our online businesses grew 23%, continuing to be a profitable growth driver. The international businesses were profitable led by our Mexican operations. In Canada, the AGI turnaround is making progress.  With many of our cost reduction initiatives behind us, we will now focus on growing profitably. Sales were down 20% or 17% in local currency. Price increases, branch closures and sales coverage optimization activities contributed to volume being down 27%. This was partially offset by a 10% increase in price as we continue to renegotiate pricing on our large customer contracts. Moving to profit. In our comparison to the prior year, there were non-recurring adjustments related to excessive and obsolete inventory and vendor rebates that impacted gross margin. After adjusting for these items and normalizing for revenue recognition, our gross margin was 430 basis points favorable to the prior year. Operating margin improved 200 basis points, driven by favorable pricing and cost reduction. Adjusting for the non-recurring items, operating margin improved 570 basis points. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year with a positive operating margin run rate. In the United States, the demand environment was strong and we were able to grow profitably. Our value proposition combined with a continued favorable response to our pricing actions resulted in increased share. Sales were up 9% in the quarter. Volume was up 8% and price was up 1% due to general inflation as well as lapping the price reset.  In the month of September, hurricanes negatively impacted sales growth by a 160 basis point. In 2017, Harvey and Irma had a larger benefit than Florence contributed in 2018. Normalizing for this impact, sales in September grew at 8%, consistent with August growth for large and medium customers. After adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change, our normalized gross profit rate increased 20 basis points. The increase was driven by customer mix and favorable price cost spread.  Operating leverage continued to be strong in the US. Having said that, you will notice some lumpiness in the quarter related to two factors; increased variable compensation versus the prior year; and the quarterly variable compensation true-up methodology. On a calendar year basis, these factors will wash out with sales growing significantly faster than operating expense. All-in, operating margin at 15.1% improved 20 basis points versus prior year. Let's take a look at our large and medium customers. Despite lapping our pricing actions in mid-August, we continued to see strong volume growth from both large and midsize customers. Our value proposition continues to resonate and we are seeing the results. Our US large customer business is performing consistently. We're seeing strong performance with our non-contract customer and spot buy purchases are increasing with contract customers. US medium volume growth of 22% is strong, especially considering a tough comp. New customers continue to be a meaningful contributor to volume growth. We are excited by what we are seeing. While we expect continued double-digit growth with medium customers, the rate of growth in Q4 will moderate. I want to take a few minutes to go in some more detail on tariffs and other issues. With respect to tariffs, we have deployed a cross-functional taskforce to gain a clearer understanding of the tariff impact as well as to execute mitigating actions. The team meets daily, reporting to senior leadership at least weekly. Some other actions include validating tariff increases, working with suppliers to minimize the cost impact, including identifying alternative supply and evaluating pricing actions while ensuring that our pricing stays market-based.  With respect to quantifying the impact, product directly sourced from China represents about 20% of the US segment’s cost of goods sold. This product is split between our national brands and our private label. National brands, which comprise the majority, are sourced from suppliers with manufacturing in multiple locations, providing flexibility in addressing the tariffs. Approximately half of this product sourced from China is impacted by 301 tariffs. Applying tariff rates of 25%, we estimate our costs would increase by about 2% for the US segment. Based on the taskforce work combined with our experience to-date, we are confident that we can find alternative supply and/or price to cover the expected tariff cost increases. Moving to taxes, we want to ensure that the main drivers between reported and adjusted tax rate versus the prior year is understood. The Q3 reported rate of 32.7% is up 1 percentage point versus prior year. We had tax benefits from US tax reform and stock-based compensation. This was more than offset by the impact of the Cromwell impairment, which is non-deductible and increased the rate by 16.3 percentage points.  With respect to the adjusted rates, the Q3 rate of 20.0% is down 11.7 percentage points versus prior year. As with the reported rate, the adjusted rate reflects benefits from US tax reform and stock-based compensation. However, the Cromwell impairment is removed from our adjusted results and does not impact the adjusted tax rate.  Finally, in July, we gave EPS guidance of $15.05 to $16.05. Further, we mentioned that it did not include the tax benefit from stock-based compensation for the second half. We’ve stayed away from predicting the exercise of stock-based awards, which is inherently difficult. Excluding that benefit, which was $0.14 in Q3, we are trending to the high-end of our guidance. As a reminder, we will provide 2019 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January. I'll now turn it back to D. G. for closing remarks.
D. G. Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. So, overall, we’re very pleased with our continued strong momentum. We know that we’ve a compelling value proposition, and the team members are energized and focused on creating value for our customers.  After lapping the price increases, the US continued to gain share at attractive margins. The turnaround in Canada is on track. We’re now focused on profitable growth off of the business model reset. Our online model continues to show very strong profitable growth and our narrowed international portfolio continues to improve profitability.  With that, I will open it up for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Merkel: A couple of questions from me. So first, based on some of my inbound emails, people are picking on the lack of operating leverage in the US for this quarter. Can you just discuss what exactly drove the variable comp throughout this quarter? And then can you confirm that this is a one-time event and that the US operating leverage will be strong in 2019?
Tom Okray: Yes, I mean as we said in our prepared remarks, the big impact that we had in terms of operating leverage was the true-up. We do this on a quarterly basis. And as our results for the year are very strong, we had to put a disproportionate amount in Q3 and Q4. Obviously throughout the year, point to wash out, if you normalized for that, we're going to see tremendous operating leverage with sales growing approximately twice the rate of operating expenses.
Ryan Merkel: And then secondly, I know you are not talking about 2019 but on the last call you stated you thought gross margin in 2019 could be stable with 2018. And I guess now that we have more information on the contract price reset and I guess an educated guess on tariffs, do you still think that you could have stable gross margins in the next year?
D. G. Macpherson: So, Ryan, we are working through all that. We will provide details in January as we announce earnings. Obviously there’s a couple of things that are pretty exciting. One is customer mix is a positive right now, so midsize customer -- non-contract customer is growing faster than large contract that will be a benefit. We have to work through the specifics of the tariffs, but we feel like we're on top of that. Our goal is to be as close to flat as we can be and we think we have got the right process in place to get the best outcome.
Ryan Merkel: And then maybe just lastly on tariffs before I turn it over. I know this is a tricky question as you are starting to have conversations with customers about pricing. But is your goal to protect gross profit dollars and maybe protect gross margin rate, is that something you can comment on today?
D. G. Macpherson: Our goal is always the same. We want to be competitively priced and we want to get the best cost we can. Our expectation is that we will be able to pass through the price or find alternative sources to mitigate the impact of the tariff. And again in January we will talk about where we think we land on that, we’ll look then.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn: So SG&A -- SG&A at the company level -- I guess SG&A was down a little sequentially despite the spike in the US comp catch up. I’m just wondering what was kind of the offset there?
Tom Okray: Well, so the offset is, just we continued cost out productivity that we've been doing for the past several quarters.
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, I would also point to Canada, as a big offset to that we've taken about $85 million out of the cost structure in Canada. And those two those actions are behind us as we had another benefit in the quarter there.
Christopher Glynn: And then passing the GM, so excluding the revenue wreck, company level gross margin was flat with the US up 20, and Canada up more than that, so it’s -- wondering whether it’s some pressures in the other businesses’ gross margin?
Tom Okray: The other businesses’ gross margin is down slightly. You also have just the algebraic dynamic of their lower margin -- gross margin overall, and they’re growing at a faster rate.
D. G. Macpherson: I mean that -- the online model continues to grow very quickly and it starts with a lower GP, and that has a big impact.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Uhlman : I was wondering if we can start with the US segment gross margin this quarter. Congrats on expanding it, positive price costs and mix. I guess I am wondering why the gross margin -- would it have been a little bit better with that mix impact in the point of price, were there any other items within that? And then I’ll just loop my second question on and that's related to the tariffs. Is there any potential for inventory reevaluation associated with that, because that’s something we have to think about for fourth quarter gross margin?
Tom Okray: Let me take the first part of the question first. What I pointed to is taking a look at the sequential. Throughout the year, our gross margin typically declined. And if you look at how we’re performing this year, it’s a much less of a decline than we have had in previous years. So we’re very happy with what’s happening with gross margin. One other thing that I would point out is FX was a headwind this quarter. It’s been a tailwind the previous two quarters. The dollar is getting stronger versus the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.
D. G. Macpherson: And then the second part of your question was around inventory revaluation, we do not believe we’ll have any concerns there. And as a reminder we’re on LIFO, I think we shouldn’t really -- we shouldn’t have a problem in any case.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Winoker: Just to drill down maybe a little bit on the tariff points that you’ve raised on Page 11. The first question is, just the simple math on that 25, on 50, on 20 I think is maybe closer to 2% and 2.5%. I do know there’s just rounding point, then all of it. Have you gone line-by-line there, math there on 2% it looks like it’s under a $1 impact if you didn’t have alternate sourcing or pricing action. Am I thinking about that the right way?
Tom Okray: Yes, I mean we’re -- well first of all we’re certainly going line-by-line. We just simplified it for presentation sake. And as we noted in our prepared remarks, we think it’s well understood and very manageable.
Steven Winoker: And that math though makes sense as well?
Tom Okray: Correct.
Steven Winoker: And then just on the alternate sourcing point just where you may have challenges on pricing or taking actions or concerned about volume impact of those pricing actions. How are you thinking about your options there in terms of substituting supply?
D. G. Macpherson: So we -- our team is looking very closely at pretty much SKU-by-SKU level and like all sourcing decisions we look at the quality of the product, we look at the cost of the product depending on how the tariff plays out. We have alternative sources already in many places, and we may have to find some additional ones. But we just look at the total economics, total landing cost and pick the one that’s got the best cost for the business. Much of our ships could -- if it’s China, if it’s shifted it could go either to India, to Mexico or the US depending on the nature of the product. The other thing I would say is, as we're going through this, we have a fairly refined should cost approach looking at what the product cost should be. We understand what portion of the cost should be related to tariff and so we are able to work with suppliers to make sure that we are actually taking the right cost increase and that’s a big focus for us.
Steven Winoker: And how long you think it will take you to migrate once you make those decisions?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, it depends. If we have an alternative source, it’s actually pretty quickly. We don’t -- at this point we don't feel like we're in a position where we are going to have any disruption and we feel like we are on top of this. So, we don’t -- are not concerned about being able to make any changes we need to make.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Luke Junk from Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Luke Junk : First question, D. G., Canada revenues slipped down again this quarter, by design, of course. Can you help us understand when run rate revenues should start to normalize? I think Tom mentioned in the prepared remarks that many of the cost reduction initiatives are now behind you. Basically, what kind of volume assumption is built into your operating margin guidance including this year heading into '19, broadly?
D. G. Macpherson: And we'll talk in January about the specifics for what our volume expectations are for next year. We do expect volume to stabilize over the next several quarters into next year. And we expect next year to be more of a stabilization period. I would note a couple of things. One is that the branch closures, which are mostly behind us, there's still some to come, have an impact on revenue. It also has a positive impact on profitability. We have reorganized our sales team and coverage is now stable. And we're now talking to customers and trying to drive growth. And I think that will help us stabilize over the next year. So we feel -- I would say in general, it's hard to look at numbers that are down that much. And it's hard for the team. But this is what we expected. And I think the team has doing a great job of managing through that. And we're in a good position now to really create value for customers, improve service, and improve the conversations we're having. So, we're optimistic about stabilizing and being able to grow.
Luke Junk : And then second question on tariffs. What I'm wondering is do you approach recovering the tariffs differently by line of business, whether it's a different customer value proposition. Obviously, either they’re impacted by your recent price actions or something like in Canada where some of the product is being imported from the US? Any thoughts you can share in respect to that?
D. G. Macpherson: So, what I would say is that the cross-functional team we have has people from our sourcing, from our product management teams, people from our pricing teams and including our commercial teams, all working together to make sure that we make the right decisions. I won't go into specifics about that. But in general, like I said before, we're really focused on making sure we get the right cost from our suppliers and have a competitive price. And so, that's really our fundamental principle in driving the results here.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Nigel Coe : Going back to the tariffs, best price, half of the -- you mentioned half -- included half activity. Can you give any color in terms of what's currently not covered in terms of product categories? Any color there would be helpful.
D. G. Macpherson: I don't know that we want to go through the details of which ones aren't covered and are covered. But what we've seen is that the way 301 is written, there are a number of product categories that aren’t exactly -- that aren't included in this. And so, roughly half of what we have coming from China is really in that bucket today.
Nigel Coe : Okay. And then on the impact you’ve laid out, the 2% or whatever it is on the US cost, does that include any benefit from the weaker RMB or was that on an episodic basis? So, are you including the depreciation of the Chinese currency in those calculations?
Tom Okray: No. The calculation was done on a constant currency basis.
Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just quickly on the hurricanes, the 160 basis points impact and you mentioned that there was some offset last year with the two hurricanes that weren't there this year. I just want to understand how that’s -- what the difference is between last year and this year in terms of the benefits versus the impact?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. So, what we do when we look at hurricane impact is we look at two things. We look at run rate business in the market that the hurricane hits and we look at hurricane product sales in the markets that it hits. Last year, Harvey obviously had a huge impact on the Houston market which lasted for a long time. And then Irma hit Florida. Those two combined had a lot more hurricane sales offsetting the business slowdown. In fact, the Florida business slowdown was very fast. There wasn't' much of it. And this year, Florence did not have as much impact. It still had a significant impact on that market. But given it didn't hit in as highly populated area as Houston, the impact was a little bit less this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray : Could we talk through the restructuring actions in the quarter, so that was $142 million? Where do you stand in terms of the actions, how much are headcount, how much is footprint, anything structural? And then expectations for the balance of the year.
D. G. Macpherson: I'll turn it over to Tom in a minute. Most of that $142 million was the Cromwell impairment. And that was $139 million of it. The rest were small in general. And most of the big changes in both Canada and the US are mostly behind us. So, maybe Tom can talk about.
Tom Okray: Yes, exactly. Taking out the Cromwell, there's some small severance items in our integration favoring North America wind down in the US. And then there's some residual branch closure costs and severance costs in Canada which is quite small and coming to an end.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then just want to get -- I might have missed this I apologize. But last quarter, you talked about some pricing delays in large US customers because of contract negotiations. But where did that stand and how much of that has been run through the P&L?
D. G. Macpherson: So, the vast majority of what we've done by the end of the year, we'll get 95% done by the end of the year. The contracts that aren't done are customer choices and/or implementation slowdowns depending on what we're talking about, and particularly, some government customers. But in general, we'll be mostly done. And we'll be talking about very small impacts going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evelyn Chow from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Evelyn Chow : Maybe just starting on a comment you made on the medium customer, I think you noted that you expect 4Q to grow double-digits but for the rate to moderate. Just curious if that's just a function of harder comps, especially noting that I guess your 3Q comps are probably even harder than your 4Q ones?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, so I would talk about a couple things, Evelyn. Thanks for the question. So, one is remember, the third quarter, we made the change last year, August 1st. So, part of the quarter was actually not under the new pricing. I would say we continue to be very encouraged and surprised by what we're seeing post-lapping the price changes in terms of midsize customer growth. Our models do not have us growing 30% forever, as you might guess. So we’ve talked about moderating, we think it's going to be moderating to a very strong growth rate. And we only had 10 weeks after lapping the prices to really understand it. But I would say we are encouraged by what we're seeing. And we'll be more definitive at the end of the year, as we talk through it. But I'd say all signs are very, very positive on midsize customers right now.
Evelyn Chow : That's helpful, D. G. And then apologies for an unoriginal question on tariffs but just curious, I mean I think what you laid out in Slide 11 is very helpful. I know the President has intimated that he is contemplating additional tariffs. In that event, have you thought about how to re-sense the math you laid out already? I mean is that going to be something closer to hitting the 30% of total company COGS that you've discussed in other forums?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. So, first of all, we don't know how that will be implemented or if it will be implemented. So, like all these things, we are watching it very closely. But we don't have an opinion yet as to how that will play through. I would say, in general, obviously the tariffs are simply inflationary. And I think you see what the inflation is roughly based on the math we've seen so far. We think in the short-term, we would be able to navigate this no matter what happens. We think relative to competitors, we might be in a better position. The long-term impacts, we could all sort of argue about over time. But certainly, in the short-term, we feel like we're on it and we know what we need to do depending on what happens.
Evelyn Chow : Understood. And then I guess last question from me. I think you noted that your spot buy has been increasing with some of your contract customers. So, just curious to know what is the mix of your planned versus unplanned purchase now versus normal or maybe versus target?
D. G. Macpherson: We don't typically talk about that specifically. And we'll take the question and think about whether at the end of the year we talk about it or not. But thanks. It's a great question, but we haven't typically laid that out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Cieslak : Just first, I wanted to go back to the guidance and just make sure we're clear on what you guys are saying. So, if I heard you right, you said that when excluding the $0.14 benefit from stock comp and the tax rate, you're running at the high end of your EPS guidance range. One, is that correct? And then two, does that assume then the other inputs to your guidance as it relates to both sales growth and gross margins are also running at the high end of your prior guidance?
Tom Okray: Yes. It's a good question. I just want to make it clear that we've raised guidance twice this year. And we're tracking toward the high end of that range. We're very encouraged by our performance. And I'd be disappointed if we don't beat guidance this year. With respect to your question on the other elements other than EPS, the same holds true. We're tracking toward the high end of the range.
Ryan Cieslak : And Tom, would you say you also would be surprised if you didn't beat the high end of both sales and gross margin guidance or is that more of an EPS comment you made there?
Tom Okray: I would say it's more EPS, but we're always slugging it out with the other parameters as well.
D. G. Macpherson: And I would say we're tracking toward the high end of all the dimensions that we laid out. So, obviously, we hope to beat them. But we're really tracking to the high end.
Ryan Cieslak : Okay. Just quickly to close that question, I'd just be curious. Is there any reason why you're not giving more specific formal guidance on the full year? Is this a change in practice or just based on where we are in the year and some variability in the fourth quarter?
Tom Okray: It's really a transition in practice. We want to get out of the business of giving quarterly guidance and giving a range and working toward a midpoint. Going forward, for next year, we'd like to give guidance once a year and then quite frankly not talk about it the rest of the year, talk more about the results we're putting on the board.
Ryan Cieslak : Okay. And then for my other question, looking at the US volume growth, it continues to be strong. But when you look at it on a two-year stack trend which we all do to try to get a sense of adjusting for prior year comps, it looks like it flatlined a little bit and implies maybe into the fourth quarter, you're starting to run more in the mid single-digits versus the high single-digits for US volume all-in. Is there something going into the fourth quarter as it relates to some of the marketing initiatives that maybe would re-inflect that higher where you can maybe achieve something in the high single-digits or is mid single-digit volume growth sort of the right way to think about at least near-term where the volumes might be growing?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. So, we haven't really seen anything that suggests that we cannot continue to gain share and continue to grow. And like I said before, we're really encouraged by post-pricing changes, what we see in our large customer volume grew consistent with what had been growing before post-price change, and our midsize customer continues to grow. So, we would expect to be north of -- certainly north of 5, if that's your question. And we expect to have strong revenue results going forward in the US.
Ryan Cieslak : Okay. And then my last question, and I'll hop back into queue. When you look at the tariff related commentary that you guys gave in your exposure there, 20% of your COGS, I think the prior guidance or color that you gave was specific to private label. And I think what it was, was something in that two-thirds of your private label, it was directly sourced from China. Is that still the case or is that now maybe a little bit lower? Just when you do the math, it suggests maybe that's a little bit lower than what you guys were previously talking about. Thanks.
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. I think the confusion there would be two-thirds would be on a revenue basis. And given the GP on a COGS basis, it's roughly the math as you see it. So, that's the difference there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Bergner : First question just on the incentive comp and how it affected the OpEx growth. If I take that 400 basis point differential on 5% growth versus 9%, I'm in the $20 million range. Should I think of then effect on the third quarter -- the usual effect on the third quarter being sort of three quarters of that $20 million being compressed in one quarter versus four quarters?
Tom Okray: Yes. We're not going to get into the specific math, but you're thinking about it the right way.
Justin Bergner : Secondly, on the tariffs, I'm not sure I understood correctly on the private label, the merchandise. Is that private label merchandise stuff that you can redirect to other countries as it relates to where you supply from? And how much of that 20% is related to private label versus branded?
D. G. Macpherson: So, private brands, we have a whole bunch of products that we buy in China that are private branded. In many cases, we already have alternative sources that are identified. And so, what we're referring to is if we have an alternative source, depending on how the math works with the tariffs, we may be looking to switch that. We may not be if the cost is still better in China post the increase. And so, the way we think about this -- some of it's risk mitigation. If we are buying something uniquely in China, we have to have an alternative source and we will have it. If we're buying something that's only produced in China, and there are some products like that, then obviously we don't have alternative source. We can go find them and that's going to be more work.
Justin Bergner : And then the 25% tariff assumption, I assume that a good chunk of the imports from China are being tariffed at 10% today. So, how much of that impact today is at the 10% versus at the 25% rate? I guess, I'm assuming that you expect it to step up to 25% at year-end.
Tom Okray: Yes. We assumed worst case for the calculation. So, we didn't take any credit for staying at 10%.
D. G. Macpherson: And some of the 10%, it actually already started to flow as you correctly state.
Justin Bergner : Okay. Do you want to break out how much of the 10% versus the 25% or would you rather not?
D. G. Macpherson: We'd rather not right now.
Justin Bergner : And then lastly, on the sales side, was there anything that was disappointing in terms of US sales, whether it be deceleration in natural resources or government customers, things that you would point to as falling short of your expectations in the quarter?
D. G. Macpherson: I would say that pretty much all things US, revenue margin, all of it was positive in the quarter relative to our expectations. And of course, there was more uncertainty going in because of the price lap. And pretty much at every turn, it would actually be what we expected to happen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Graham : I just have a question about US price which was a positive to 1 in the quarter. I was just hoping you could give us just a little bit of color on sort of the disaggregation of that because the price actions were still lapping. So, I'm assuming, of course, that the price actions were negative but that you had price increases and mixes in there as well. Could you give us any color on the buckets?
Tom Okray: Yes. Sure. I mean the way we look at the pricing is how much is commodity, vendor-related, end market levers, and then how much is related to the price reset. I mean what we've seen is the decreases associated with the price reset has slowed considerably, as you would expect, as we work through the contracts. And we've been very consistent and actually improving in terms of the price we've been able to pass on related to tariffs and other market base.
D. G. Macpherson: I would also say that the other element is customer mix was positive in the quarter which helps price. And we talked about spot buys; spot buys increasing helps as well with large contract customers as we're not selling as much deeply discounted items. So, yes.
Scott Graham : D. G., would you say that's the first or the second quarter that spot buy and medium size customer mix has actually begun to read through?
D. G. Macpherson: Boy, I think it's the second quarter that that's started to read through. But I don't -- don’t hold me to that, but I believe that's true.
Scott Graham : Okay. And lastly, again on the pricing. So, you have the price actions with the large customers. When you go back to those customers for price increases, could you kind of walk us through were there sort of upper bands and this kind of thing that slows things down or how do you work through that with those customers?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. We won't talk about specifics. I would say we have a very tried and true process that we use to work through any changes with customers. And our commercial team does a great job of navigating with our customers to get the best outcome for both of us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Baumann : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just had a couple clean-ups here, a lot has been covered already. Just on the tariffs, it sounds like you still expect to mitigate through alternate sourcing or pricing. Do you think you can offset the tariff cost right away or you think there might be some lag?
D. G. Macpherson: So, given what we know now, there would not be a big lag. We think it would be -- given what we expect in terms of the 10 going to 25, we think we'll be roughly coincident, close enough.
Patrick Baumann : Okay. And then just a couple little clean-ups here. Can you tell me anything on branch count? I'm not sure if it was in the release or if it was I missed it. Just wondering what that looks like today versus the second quarter end. I know you guys are still closing branches in Canada or I think you are?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. We are. So, we will, by the end of this year, have 30 -- 31 branches -- 35 branches opened in Canada. Most of them have already been closed. We closed seven in the quarter in Canada. And really, the rest is virtually nothing. The branch count is stable pretty much everywhere else.
Patrick Baumann : And as you've been closing these branches in Canada, have there been any gains from them because I haven't seen any of those kind of running -- or I don't think you've called any of those out?
D. G. Macpherson: Could you repeat the question?
Patrick Baumann : Have there been gains on those branches? I haven't seen them called out.
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. Keep in mind, yes, so, typically, they're smaller branches and not necessarily as valuable as the US branches in terms of sales.
Tom Okray: Yes. The gains would obviously show up in our restructuring charges. And they're relatively small.
Patrick Baumann : Got it. So, those restructurings are net of gains?
Tom Okray: Yes. Correct.
D. G. Macpherson: Yes.
Patrick Baumann : Got it. I understand. And then last a couple of, just in terms of the price write down, I'm not sure if you mentioned that, but are you done now with US large customer contracts?
D. G. Macpherson: We talked about that before. By the end of the year, we'll be 95% done, so mostly. The rest will be small. And that's almost all customer choice.
Patrick Baumann : Sorry. Yes, I missed that. And then last one from me. Just Zoro US, how did that grow in the quarter?
D. G. Macpherson: It continued to grow strong -- strong growth in Zoro US.
Patrick Baumann : Is it up like -- I think you said 23% for total single-channel. Is it up at that kind of range or is it going …?
D. G. Macpherson: It's not quite that. But it was up …
Tom Okray: It was up 18%.
D. G. Macpherson: …18% in the quarter. We're just looking at the number 18.
Patrick Baumann : Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Hamzah Mazari : My first question is just around price/cost. We talked a lot about pricing. But I think a few quarters ago, D. G., you had talked about COGS deflation. And as you know, there's a lot more inflation in the system now, whether you look at labor, freight, other items. Do you still expect COGS deflation going forward?
D. G. Macpherson: So, no. What we talked about is price cost spread and are we able to get -- are we able to mitigate COGS increases and get the right price for our customers. This year, we had talked about being down half a percent. We still expect to be roughly there. That's mostly because of the initiatives we've done to manage our costs, to understand supplier cost and improve our cost structure. But otherwise, we would actually be in an inflation mode this year of 1% to 2%, probably.
Tom Okray: To be clear though, for the quarter, we did have product cost deflation.
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. We did.
Hamzah Mazari : Good. Got it. Very helpful. And then last question. I'll turn it over. Just on the Canadian turnaround, D. G., Grainger has tried that for several years, as you know. This time, maybe just frame for us what's different this time in terms of strategy. I know you highlighted operating margin run rate positive Q4. But just high level, what's different in this turnaround versus past several years?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. Well, this one is a lot more, I would say, intense in the sense that we've completely reset the business. We've combined the back office with the US and created North American centers of excellence. We've gone from 170 to 35 branches. We've completely restructured the sales organization. And all of that basically means we've taken about $85 million in cost out of the business. And we're now going to start growing that business. We're adding some of the US assortment to that business, the ability to buy out of the US. We're really focused on expanding -- diversifying the customer base throughout the business. And all those things I think will mean it feels very, very different and allows us to be much more consistent in the growth we see and the performance we see out of that business going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Barger : Yes. Thank you. So, going back to what you just said about Canada, the 4Q positive operating margin exit is more on price and volume stabilization at this point, less on cost control like the branch closures that you just executed. And should we expect that you remain positive on a quarterly basis going forward?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. You should expect that we remain positive going forward. A lot of what you're going to see in the fourth quarter, it will be the first time that you see really clean look at the cost structure as well. So, it's not just price and volume stabilization. It's also the cost structure getting to the new level.
Steve Barger : Understood. And incrementals have been solid year-to-date, averaging about 24%. As you think about tougher comps, you think about mix, volume, tariffs. If we see a mid single-digit growth environment going into '19, do you think you could maintain a 20% incremental or better? Or should we be thinking high-teens given the puts and takes?
D. G. Macpherson: Oh! I think we should be able to maintain a 20% or higher.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.
John Inch : So, if we're going to aspire to a framework of gross margins stable, does that imply a similar boost to mix from growth rates at the medium versus large today, I mean presumably those are going to slow, but do you still expect that ratio to kind of hold at 2 for 1 or whatever?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. We'll come back and talk to you about that in January, specifically. But our expectation is that midsize customers will be growing faster than the rest of the business. And that will help us. That'll be a positive.
John Inch : Okay. So, that makes sense. If we back into -- it's a little bit of a follow-up on that variable contribution question. But if we back into kind of the OpEx leverage, if you ex-out restructuring, we're coming up with about 20%. And the genesis of my question is I think, D. G., earlier in the discussion, you alluded to the fact that -- you or Tom alluded to the fact that perhaps restructuring was maybe sort of tapering off. I'm curious because it seems like a lot of the OpEx benefit has come from restructure in Canada and so forth. What's your trajectory for restructuring? I mean do you see as much opportunity to go after various projects in Canada or the United States or how should we think about that?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. So, we've been running to a cost program that we talked about last year. We had been meeting or exceeding those expectations. We are in a good position now to make sure we improve our cost structure in 2019. And it comes across the entirety of the business. A lot of it actually comes from changes we have made recently, whether it's centralizing contact centers or going to the centers of excellence at AGI. All that flows through the P&L next year. I would also say that there's still great opportunity to improve the core big cost buckets in the US, whether that's getting more revenue per seller in the US, whether that's getting more lines per hour in the distribution centers. We're going to have the Louisville distribution center up and running next year. More of our volume will then be going through automation which will help the cost structure. And we continue to get comfortable with the contact center footprint we have and getting more effective, more efficient there. So, the big cost buckets, we see a path to continue to improve the cost structure. We think that's going to continue in the future.
John Inch : Makes sense. Just last one from me. Canada, I guess we had talked about a 4% to 8% margin rate in '19. What's changed in 2018 that prospectively makes that not a viable target or the low end or something like that? What ultimately changed in Canada this year? And maybe the 4% to 8% is still an aspirational target if we're going positive at the end of the quarter. I mean how do you sort of translate?
D. G. Macpherson: We actually don't think anything has changed. So that's still the range we're talking about so.
John Inch : Okay. So, 4% to 8% is still on the table then?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. And we'll talk specifics -- on about what we think specifically in January.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to D. G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
D. G. Macpherson: So, thanks for joining us today. I would just make a few points coming out of the call. Thanks for your questions. The first one is in the US, there was a lot of uncertainty going into the quarter about what happened when we lapped the prices. That actually has been very positive. Almost every metric we have in the US is looking positive in terms of our growth, our GP, our expenses, our customer acquisition. So, we're really excited about what we saw in the quarter from the United States. Canada turnaround continues to go well. It's very challenging, but we are in a good position now based on the new cost structure to drive growth and to be profitable going forward in Canada. The online model continues to grow and to grow at attractive rates. So, we're very positive there. And then the international business which is much narrowed is in a good position to continue to drive margins. So, we feel really good about where we're at as a company and where we're heading. And I really appreciate the time. So, thanks for being on the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode and a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Irene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger’s Q2 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Tom Okray, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of the slide presentation and in our Q2 press release. Both are available on our Investor Relations Web site. D.G. will cover our performance for the quarter, and Tom will give an update on our 2018 expectations. After that, we will open the call for questions. D. G., to you.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. So the second quarter marked our third consecutive quarter of strong results and the results certainly beat our expectations. Our volume growth significantly outpaced the market, driven by actions to consistently deliver value to our customers at relevant prices. The demand environment remains strong. Our sales performance was driven largely by the strength of the U.S. business and our single channel online businesses. In the U.S., we continue to see a solid response to our pricing actions with total volume growth of 11%. We saw growth across all of our major end markets, including manufacturing, commercial, healthcare and government. We know that customers value the relationships they have with Grainger, our customer service, technical support and fulfillment capabilities. When we couple that with the relevant pricing our offer is very compelling. And as a result, we’re growing faster and more attractive parts of the US business. This is not only driving GP dollar growth but also resulted in better than expected gross profit margin for the quarter. In Canada, the execution of our turnaround is progressing as planned and our actions there led to GP and operating earnings improvement. Our single channel online and international businesses both had nice growth and expanded operating earnings in the quarter. Based on our performance and continued momentum, we’re raising our full year guidance. Tom will share the details of our updated guidance later in the presentation. Turning to reported results, Q2 2018 reported results include restructuring charges of $15 million and $0.21 impact to EPS. Now, this morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Total Company sales in the quarter were up 9%. Volume was up 9%. Price was flat as price deflation in the U.S. was offset by price increase increases in Canada. We had foreign exchange favorability of 1% in the quarter. That was offset by negative 1% impact from the divestiture of Techni-Tool in the U.S. We have now lapped the Techni-Tool divestiture as of mid-July. Our normalized GP rate declined 30 basis points after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change and the timing of our annual sales meeting. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volume. This all led to operating earnings growth of 23% in the quarter. I'll cover our other businesses first. As a reminder, other businesses include our single channel online model and our international businesses. Sales for these businesses were up 18% in the quarter, 14% was price volume and 4% was from currency. Our online businesses drove 25% sales growth and continue to be a profitable growth driver. Our international businesses had solid organic growth in the quarter and contributed to operating margin expansion. We are happy with where our international portfolio is today. In Canada, sales were down 6% and down 10% in local currency. We introduced price increases in the fourth quarter of last year, and are renegotiating pricing on large customer contracts. As a result, price was up 10% and contributed to GP rate expansion of 455 basis points in the quarter after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change. Volume was down 20% due to the planned price increases, branch closures and sales covers optimization activities. As we talked about before, this is going to be a smaller but more profitable business when we're through with the reset. Operating margin improved 290 basis points due to higher GP rate and cost management. The turnaround is progressing as planned with several activities running ahead of schedule. Much of the heavy lifting is behind us and we’re encouraged by the improvement and profitability. We believe we’ll be in a good position to exit the year profitably and go on offense in 2019. In the U.S., both the volume response to our pricing actions and the demand environment was strong. Sales were up 9% in the quarter. Total volume was up 11%, including seasonal sales and holiday timing at positive 1%. Volume growth was partially offset by price deflation of 1% and negative 1% impact from the Techni-Tool divestiture last July. Our normalized GP rate decline 65 basis points after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change at the timing of the sales meeting. Operating expenses in U.S. were up 2% after adjusting for revenue recognition accounting change. Operating margin was better-than-expected in the quarter as expense leverage on total volume growth of 11% more than offset the GP rate decline. Now as we look at growth in the U.S, we’re continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and midsize customers when we remove pricing as a barrier. We are gaining share and seeing volume growth with those customer groups. Our digital marketing activity is also having an impact, and overall returns on both digital and off-line marketing are improving. U.S. large customer volume increased 9% in the quarter above expectations. We’re seeing increased share gains with large customers as they buy more infrequently purchased items and consolidate their purchases with Grainger. U.S. mid-size volume also exceeded expectations with growth of 29% over the prior year. We’re seeing meaningful growth with both new and existing customers. Existing mid-size customers, including lapsed customers are buying more; we’re seeing that in our volume; in the number of transactions per customer; and in the number of customer contacts that are buying. We’re also acquiring net new mid-size customers for the first time in a long time. When we look at the mid-size business growth, the meaningful portion of it is coming from new customer acquisitions. Overall, we remain optimistic about the U.S. business in 2018. I'll now turn it over the Tom who will discuss our expectations for the year.
Tom Okray: Thanks, D. G. I want to start by adding some commentary on our results for the quarter. Let's take a closer look at gross profit. We normalize Company gross profit rate in the quarter for two items; one, a change in revenue recognition accounting standards; and two, the timing of our Annual Sales Meeting. As a reminder, due to a change in accounting standards related to revenue recognition, we were required to reclassify certain KeepStock service costs from operating expense to cost of goods sold beginning in 2018. We have slides in the appendix that outline this change at the Company and U.S. level. Separately, suppliers provide funding for our Annual Sales Meeting. This funding benefits gross profit margin and is spread over three consecutive months, beginning in the month of the sales meeting. In 2017, the sales meeting occurred in March and in 2018, the sales meeting occurred in February. The Company normalized gross profit rate of 39.2% was down 30 basis points, which was better than our expectation. This was driven by price cost spread and mixed favorability in the U.S., and the price increases in Canada. U.S. normalized gross profit rate of 39.8% declined 65 basis points. As D. G. mentioned earlier, in the U.S., we’re growing in areas we want to be growing. With large customers, price deflation is improving as we aren’t deeply discounting infrequently purchased items, and customers are more comfortable with our pricing level. Some of the gross profit favorability in the quarter was also due to the delayed timing of our large customer contract negotiation. We’re now through almost 90% of our contract revenue and expect to get through the majority of the remaining contracts by the end of this year. We did see some supplier inflation in the quarter, partially due to tariffs. And we’re able to pass through price while maintaining market competitiveness. Company operating margin was 12.6%, up 150 basis points, driven largely by expense leverage on strong sales performance. Earnings per share of $4.37 in the quarter was up 59% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher operating earnings and lower corporate tax rate. Operating cash flow of $248 million was up 30% versus the prior year and free cash flow of $211 million was up 32% versus the prior year. The increase in both cash flow number was driven largely by higher earnings and lower tax rate. Page 13 covers our updated guidance for the year. What we shared in April is on the left side of the chart and our updated guidance is on the right. We outperformed our internal expectations by about $0.60 in Q2 that flows through to the updated guidance for the year. In addition, we are also adding $0.15 of favorability to the second half, largely as a result of the momentum we are seeing, including lower than expected price deflation. As a result, we are taking both the high and the low end of the EPS range, up $0.75. We now expect revenue growth to be in the range of up 5.5% to 8.5%. We expect an operating margin of 11.5% to 11.9% which is 50 to 90 basis points higher than the prior year. We expect EPS to be between $15.05 and $16.05 or 32% to 40% higher than the prior year. From a sales perspective, we continue to believe that our volume growth will outpace the market by 300 plus basis points this year. With respect to gross profit margin, after normalizing for the 50 basis points related to the revenue recognition accounting change, the rate is expected to decline between 15 and 20 basis points versus the prior year. Further, we expect our gross profit rate to follow the normal sequential trend in 2018. For 2019, we expect the gross profit to be relatively stable versus 2018. I want to spend a moment on price cost spread in the U.S. We previously expected a price headwind of negative 1.5% for the year. That value was a net number comprised of negative 3% from our August 2017 pricing reset, partially offset by a positive 1.5% from favorable mix and market based price increases. Today, we are updating the total price headwind to be negative 1%. We now expect price deflation related to the reset to improve due in part to timing of contract negotiations. We expect to complete a majority of the contracts this year. Our expectation for COGS deflation remains unchanged at 50 bps, driven by our internal product cost optimization initiative. We expect that we will see some supplier inflation related to tariffs in the second half. And we are confident in our ability to pass on price Increases. I think it’s helpful to point out that the current market dynamic is similar to past periods of inflation. Grainger has historically done well in managing cost and getting price realization through these periods. I’ll now turn it back to D. G. for closing remarks.
D. G. Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. So overall, we’re very pleased with our continued strong momentum. Our value proposition is resonating in the U.S., resulting in strong growth with gross margin rates above expectations. And we are developing stronger relationships with customers of all sizes. We are executing our turnaround as planned in Canada, and expect to exit the year profitably. Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion, and our international businesses are contributing to earnings. We continue to get strong expense leverage across the business and are on track to achieve the productivity targets we laid out at Analyst Day in November. We’re well positioned to gain share and improve our economics going forward. With that, I'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ryan Merkel: So first question high-level question on the cycle, D. G. There has been increasing talk and worry about peak cycle and what tariffs may do to demand. You just put up a very good quarter obviously. But what are you hearing from customers about the second half? And are there any signs of slowdown anywhere that you can see?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, through the quarter, we haven’t seen any signs of the slowdown at this point. There are certainly conversations with customers. I would say most of those conversations, tariff related, tend to be longer-term. So questions about whether or not product will actually be -- end product will be made in China and shipped over given the way the tariffs are structured. I have talked with couple of customers about that. But in the short-term, we feel like there hasn’t been a lot of action yet, and we don't see any slowdown at this point.
Ryan Merkel: And then secondly, OpEx growth has been very well controlled for few quarters now, up low single digits. So two questions; how long can this last; and then could you comment on what is normal OpEx growth?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, I think if you looked over our history, normal probably would -- you have to have it in quotes. I’m not sure you have anything that’s exactly normal. I would say we feel like, for this year and next at least and in 2020, we have the opportunity to get pretty significant leverage. Our expectation is that our OpEx will cover merit for folks every year there is built in productivity every single year. And so if the market -- if we grow 6% volume, we would expect our OpEx to be three or something like that or less in general.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: So as you talk about the U.S. large customers finishing their round of contract negotiations. Just curious what happens next as you would envision it, assuming contracts renew on a rolling basis over time, you finish now maybe it starts up again. Do subsequent rounds tend to include some additional price concession versus volume trade-ups?
D. G. Macpherson: I think any time you are in a negotiation for a contract, it’s a competitive situation that has not changed at all, that will continue to be the case moving forward. What we do feel like is off of the price reset, we are competitive. I think what you’re seeing with large customer GP is -- gross profit is that it's not down very much, because we’ve always been competitive with those customers. And we feel like we’re well positioned to go through whatever cycles come up in the future. And our focus to those negotiations is typically how we save customers’ time and how we save him money. And if we focus on that, we have the ability to continue to have really strong economics at the other end if we do the right things.
Christopher Glynn: And then on Canada, just wondering your comment go on offense in 2019. You clearly see volume impact from the price reset. But could you elaborate on what you mean by go on offense?
D. G. Macpherson: Turn the situation from shrinking to growing. We are through -- teams have done a really nice job there getting through the vast majority, if not all, the restructuring and the changes we have to make. We’re stabilizing the business with certain customers and then we’re going to grow. We’re going to grow in a way that allows us to be profitable as we grow. And so when we talk about going on offense, it’s actually what we mean grow profitably.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey: D. G., about a year ago, you declined to refine your 2021 margin goals and I assume that’s still the case. But first off, the 12% to 13% overall operating margin target for 2019. Should we assume that’s still in effect?
D. G. Macpherson: Until we change it, yes, you should assume that still in effect.
David Manthey: Second, as we look at that prior 2021 range, especially for Canada, you were looking at 7% to 9%. And I believe your 2019 goal is 4% to 8%. When we think about Canada, should we assume that structural operating margins are limited to high single digits, or changes you've made to the footprint and the model here just recently? Can you ultimately start to approach double digits and maybe even get closer to U.S. levels?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, I think I’d answer that with two comments. The first one is we don’t believe there’s anything structurally that should keep us from having double digit margins in Canada if we do all the right things. So we do believe that. Given where we’re sitting, we’re really focused on getting to the improvement goals we set in the next year, that's really, really important. And so we view that as a step on the path to improving growth and profitability of the business. But I don’t think there’s any reason why we couldn’t be low double digit earnings in Canada at some point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow. Please go ahead.
Chris Dankert: I guess first off, D. G., would you mind kind of like highlighting what we’ve see as far as restructuring savings in the first half versus the back half. It seems like it should be a little bit back half weighted here, and just your confidence in hitting those targets?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, really confident in hitting those targets, mostly because most of the actions that we have to take have already been taken, or were just completed in the last quarter. So we feel like the Canada targets are going to be -- we’re going to hit those, and the U.S. targets most of the actions we’ve already taken. So we are highly confident in what we’re seeing.
Chris Dankert: And then just looking at 2Q here, it seems like the loss on your investment in clean energy was quite a bit lower 2Q versus last year and the last quarter. I mean, any -- and if you stake out for us expectations there going forward, should we expect that the losses there just will be structurally smaller now?
D. G. Macpherson: We’ve got no change in terms of our guidance on coal investment. We’re keeping $0.05 to $0.10 EPS range.
Chris Dankert: So that even just might what we saw in the second quarter here?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann, JPMorgan.
Patrick Baumann: A quick question on the margins, you guys made a 12.5% total company margins in the first half full year that is I guess 11.5% to 11.9%. So it implies -- the second half implies margins that’s a little bit worse than normal sequential deterioration versus the first half. Historically, it’s about 100 basis points. This year it seems like you're embedding 150 basis points of degradation versus the 12.5% you did in the first half. And I’m just curious if there's anything that stands out that's driving that? And I know you mentioned large contract renegotiations maybe that’s the factor, I’m just want to help with the math there if you can.
D. G. Macpherson: I think that the reality is that we still are, in many ways, in waters in certain places. So to the extent we saw mid-size customers continue to grow like we’ve seen them grow, we saw large local customers grow, like we’ve been seeing, but certainly there is a chance for us to do be better than what we’ve talked about. But it’s so early on many things that we’re seeing. We’re still getting a rough handle on that. We feel like we want to stick with the wide range at this point, and we’re optimistic about the path along.
Patrick Baumann: And can you talk about your direct exposure to China sourcing, and I assume some of the private label products you sell come from there. I am just not sure, if you can quantify. And also how you're approaching the tariff situation just from a risk mitigation perspective for some of that stuff?
D. G. Macpherson: The vast majority of our source items come from China up to two thirds or even more than that at this point. There's also -- so there’s two things’ one is our private brand products that come from China; the other is branded products that come from China, both have the potential to be impacted here. If I focus on our private branded products, so we’ve been looking very closely at alternative sources and understanding what we can do and how we can shift. And so if we think about private brand, we have 23% private brand. Most of that’s China for every item that is -- that you could, we have an alternative source effectively and we can shift if we need to. We haven't seen yet the economics to make that work but we are looking at consistently. And we feel like we’re in a good shape to really understand what to do.
Patrick Baumann: And then last one for me, the buy back in the quarter slowed down a bit, any reason to that. And is there any update to cash flow expectations or buyback for the year?
D. G. Macpherson: No, we’re just looking at our model and opportunistically buying back. For the year-to-date, we bought back over 760,000 shares just really looking at the price, the stock in the market. No intentional slowdown.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Could you comment on your business with the U.S. government and specifically exposure on Section 846 of the NDA contract?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, so 846 is still -- I think you know this is still under study. So there's actually absolutely no implementation of that at this point. Our business with the government, the U.S. government has been very strong this year, continues to be strong. We have great relationships across a number of different organizations, the military organizations and beyond. And we’ve seen really strong results with what we do. In many cases, we are really helping military bases and other federal government to manage their inventory, and that's a big part of what we do for them. And so we haven’t seen any impact yet from that bill, and I think there is uncertainty around what that bill is actually going to look like at the end.
Deane Dray: And then just in terms of where we are in the cycle. Are you seeing or feeling pressures, let's say freight? Are you able to pass that -- types of incremental charges to your customers? And any issues with labor shortages in your organization?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, certainly I would say that the labor market is tight and the freight market is tight. So there is no question about that. We haven't seen labor shortages taking the second of those two. With freight, our team has done a really nice job of looking at alternatives, our initiatives that more than offset the pressure for price increases at this point. Certainly, there's pressure, particularly with truckload and LTL where drivers are the shortage and there’s all kinds of issues that are challenging in that market. But so far we’ve managed through that really well.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: I just wanted to go back to the OpEx control, and appreciate the details D.G. But can you just maybe give us an update on where you are with the sales force expansion, sales force effectiveness and also your marketing strategies? And maybe just go in a bit more detail, obviously, you’re investing in certain categories. What are the offsets to SG&A to enable you to get that leverage into 2019?
D. G. Macpherson: Nigel, I didn’t understand. You said -- I didn’t fully understand the question. You said sales force expansion and you had another thing in that that I didn’t understand.
Nigel Coe: Yes, marketing so online marketing and traditional…
D. G. Macpherson: So when we think about OpEx control, we look at the entirety of our spend. We get very strong productivity typically in pockets that have very big populations that includes our distribution centers, our contact centers. We continue to see that go well. We’re continuing to get productivity in our sales force. And putting in the CRM has helped our sales force to have the right conversations, go to the right customers and its improving. We expect to – we're learning and we expect that to continue going forward. We’ve added some sellers and we are adding sellers, I’d say, at a modest level consistently. And the sellers that we do have are going to be more productive, and that’s the way we think about that.
Nigel Coe: And then just picking up on the 301s, I think you said 22% of your sales are private label products, bulk of that comes from China. Is that right?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, that’s correct.
Nigel Coe: So based on the current CapEx that we have, the initial 50 and then the next 200. Have you been in any way concerned about how much of that 20% is currently wrapped into those?
D. G. Macpherson: So far, it’s a small portion of it and our team is working very hard to make any changes we need to make with that portion. We’ll have -- obviously it’s just expands and the next tranche comes in, we’ll have more to tell you about that as we learn more.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evelyn Chow of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Evelyn Chow: First question, just thinking about the medium customer volume growth, still very strong and you noted that you’re finally seeing new customers acquired after a long time. What are those new customers responding to most, out of your offerings and initiatives?
D. G. Macpherson: So I would say that the interesting thing about our performance for the last few years with mid-size customers has been, when we’ve talked to them, they have been very positive about their perception of Grainger. But pricing has -- their comments have been well the price is not for me; you aren’t for me. And so I think what we’re seeing now is our technical product support our assortment our performance. The basics that we provide customers are really, really valuable to mid-size industrial customers. We can help them find the right product. We’re very easy to deal with if they can get somebody on the phone to understand things they can’t. And so what we're seeing is price is not a barrier. And so the things we’ve always done and we continue to do better are really resonating with those customers.
Evelyn Chow: And then I just want to make sure I understand the components of the back half guidance raise. So I know of those roughly $0.75 raise that you put up today for the full year, you said $0.60 was from 2Q and then $0.15 in the back half. Am I correct in understanding that is; A, OpEx performance better than you expect there’s perhaps upside to that; and then secondarily, I think in your prior guide there was about $0.10 of timing related negative impact in the back half. Could you just update that for us, as well?
Tom Okray: Evelyn, you’re correct. We basically took the $0.60, which was our forecast versus our EPS and took that through to the guide and then put another $0.15 in the back half related to price -- price volume in the U.S. And as D. G. said earlier, we’re intentionally keeping the range wide. It's early days dealing with customers we haven't dealt with in a while, so intentionally keeping the range wide. But as D. G. said, we’re very optimistic in terms of how we’re performing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Hamzah Mazari: The first question is just around the medium customer business. D. G. is there anything preventing your market share in medium customer being similar to large customer? Is there any underlying dynamics in that medium customer market that, either make it more competitive or different from the largest customer market, any color there? Thank you.
D. G. Macpherson: Well, I think the competitiveness is different. I think if you’re serving large complex customer, the set of customers that can’t even do the same things that you want to do -- I’d say our competitors that can’t do the things you want to do are probably narrower. That said, I don't know that there's any gate to us achieving similar share with mid-size customers we have with large, primarily because of how much they value our assortment, our tech support, our search, our ability to help them get what they need. But that’s an interesting question for the future, Hamzah, we’re looking at that really closely and we’ll see the trajectory as we get on and we’ll figure that out.
Hamzah Mazari: And just a follow-up, you talked about stable gross margin in 19, maybe for Tom. Do you assume that the COGS deflation that you guys are seeing, even though there’s an inflation in the market today that that’s structural and that's sustainable in ’19 when you talk about stable gross margin?
Tom Okray: I think we've got many levers we can pull in ’19, going forward. Our PPO organization really I think is very, very good process and is going to enable us to have deflation going forward. So there is other opportunities as well as in the supply chain for gross margin. And we’re comfortable that the gross margin, going forward, is going to be a stable.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast. Please go ahead.
Ryan Cieslak: Just take on that last question there. If price cost is improving for you guys and certainly feels like mix is also moving in the right direction. I’m just trying to understand why you wouldn’t be able to expand gross margins in 2019, or maybe you just trying to be conservative just given timing right now. As you said, it’s still early days. But maybe talk a little bit about ultimately what would offset your ability to expand gross margins in 2019?
D. G. Macpherson: I think on a like for like basis, we would expect to have slight GP expansion in 2019. I think that what you’re probably not accounting for is there are a number of contracts, large contracts that are going to be implemented in the back half of this year that will have some impact on GP. And we’ve talked about that before. But it’s 10% of the contracts or something that we still have to do roughly, and some of those are fairly large. So that's going to be the drag in 2019 that we’ll need to overcome.
Ryan Cieslak: And D. G., just sticking with 2019 thought process. Is 6% to 8% volume growth still the range that we should be thinking about? Or is there any change and how to think about that, either from one, the fact that volumes are running ahead of your expectations, but also that also makes the comp little bit more difficult now going into ’19?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, we haven’t changed that. I think what I would say is that as we look at all the different sources of our growth right now, we’re getting a better understanding of what we think next year will be and we’ll talk about that as we get more refined and understanding. We’re growing with it -- are now faster and growing with it.
Ryan Cieslak: And then my last question and I’ll get back in line. The digital marketing initiatives you guys deployed. If I remember right, that was something that really was deployed more so in this past quarter. Just can you help me thinking about the timing of that, maybe we have half of a benefit do you think from those initiatives or meaning did you get a bigger benefit as go here into the third quarter as it relates to potential new customer growth in the back half of the year? Thanks.
D. G. Macpherson: So we’ve been fairly consistent in the investments we’ve made in digital marketing throughout the year. We stepped it up a bit. I think we’ll get more benefits because I think we’re going to get better at, and we’re learning as we go. And so I think it won't necessarily be because we spend the whole lot more, but as we understand what customers respond to, we’re going to keep getting better and the effectiveness of that will increase.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO. Please go ahead. 
Scott Graham: I am hoping and this is maybe a question for Tom to maybe square my math here. Last quarter, the U.S. business price mix was again away from the resets, was plus 1.5. And this quarter, it looks like its plus 1.5 again. I'm assuming that price was more of a component of the 1.5 in this past period, which would suggest that the mix actually deteriorated, if my math is square. Whereas the areas where you're getting the better volumes off of the price reset are mix positive. Could you maybe walk us through that?
Tom Okray: I’m not sure I fully understand the question. Can you take me back again and repeat please?
Scott Graham: So you’re showing on your slide -- in your slide deck here Page 14 that price mix this past quarter thereabout was up 1.5 and last quarter 1.5. Assuming that price increases has accelerated modestly as the year progress, which suggests that the mix component of that 1.5 has actually deteriorated. Yet the areas where you’re lowering prices, including the large customers on the spot buy business and medium-size customers which are much higher gross margin sales, those are accelerating. So where is the mix negative coming from, because it doesn’t appear to be coming from those areas, in fact those areas go the other way.
Tom Okray: Yes, I think your first assumption in terms of the comparable mix I mean the comparable price increase is not fully accurate for Q1 and Q2, because we are seeing favorable mix related to gross profit in terms of certainly our medium size customers which have higher gross profit. Now, it’s a much smaller amount of the total. We do see minor deterioration related to product mix and that's probably a function of our customer mix. But we're not seeing large deteriorations associated with customer mix, we’re seeing favorable with customer mix.
Scott Graham: Yes, as I would have thought, I guess maybe I’m just still having trouble squaring the math, but I’ll take that with Irene offline. My follow up question is simply on the tariffs and how you source and what have you. And I guess it's good news you’re not seeing a lot of the proxy you saw on the list. But I guess what I'm wondering is, are you implying that, and your competitors have said the same thing. We’re ready to alternate source if needs be this kind of thing. But that that alternate source thing would obviously come at a higher cost. So are you implying that you're not concerned about it, because you’ll get the price to compensate for that?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, that’s exactly right. If the market price of items goes up because of the tariffs, we will be able to pass that, our history suggest that is true.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli.
Justin Bergner: First off, I just want to make sure I understand that the $0.60, I guess, better performance versus expectations, doesn't include any pull forward from the second half in terms of the $0.15 that you’re guiding better for the second half?
D. G. Macpherson: It does not.
Justin Bergner: And then on the cost inflation side, you’re keeping that at negative 50 basis points. Is that because the cost inflation won’t really come through until 2019? Or is it because it’s coming through in the second half, but you’re taking better actions to offset some of that?
D. G. Macpherson: It’s the latter, yes. It’s the latter. We’re taking better actions to offset some of that.
Justin Bergner: And can you clarify what you’re able to do more on the cost side to improve the price cost dynamic?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, a lot of that has to do with the process that Tom mentioned, which is really understanding -- working with suppliers to understand what the costs should be. And making sure we get the right assortment, which can be at the right cost. So I would say that the process, as we use, consistently drive COGS improvement and we continue to see that.
Tom Okray: I mean, one of the things coming into Grainger and I was very pleasantly surprised looking at the clean sheet approach that they do related to working with the suppliers. I would think it would be up close to being industry benchmark in terms of clean sheet and looking at replicating the suppliers; income statement, et cetera. So it's really a top-notch process in place.
Justin Bergner: And then just lastly if I may, I assume that some of the higher earnings is going to translate into better free cash flow. Any comments on how you’d intend to deploy that better free cash flow versus the view you set out in the last year?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, we’ll have more to say about that at a later date. But I mean just to touch on it briefly, I mean obviously, we like our investment grade credit rating and that's important to us. Following that, we’re going to invest in the operations. We've got opportunities to have a lot of high-ROIC projects, which we’re sorting through right now. And then third, we’ll give the money back to shareholders, dividends and buybacks. I wouldn't expect any dramatic change in the current capital allocation process.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with UBS.
Steve Winoker: So I just wanted to follow up a couple of questions. One is on the whole sourcing discussion and tariffs. Just to be clear, the comments that you made were about the first $50 billion tranche in terms of what’s effective to you, not the $200 billion correct?
D. G. Macpherson: That is correct. That is absolutely correct, yes.
Steve Winoker: And then do you see in that -- should this continue to escalate and obviously, there’s a lot of uncertainty around that. Is there actually a share gain opportunity for you here as you look at customers? Or is this hard to see through some positives in this?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, I’d have to ask you what you mean by share gain opportunity and how that would come about. But generally, as you know, it’s just an inflationary action and so we would expect that to be the outcome here.
Steve Winoker: Well, let me take it offline. On the medium customer comments that you made on the daily volume growth, now that those are comping against more difficult numbers, but still accelerating significantly or significantly higher. How much, when you think about the reengagement versus the customer acquisition growth that you’ve been commenting on. Where do you see this settling out over the next three or four quarters when you’re passed the tougher comp given the rate of growth that you’re seeing on the customer acquisition side?
D. G. Macpherson: I think we’ll give a lot more detail on that as we move to the next couple of quarters. What we said at this point is we are having a meaningful portion of this that is actually new customer acquisition. We’re trying to understand exactly where we think that settles. We don't have enough months and quarters behind us to be completely sure yet. But as we do and get more certainty, we will be sharing that.
Steve Winoker: But just again back to some of the comments you’ve made versus your 2% versus your 4% share historically, even if it is a more competitive dynamic, reasonably that 4% is really the feeling there, I would assume.
D. G. Macpherson: Right exactly.
Operator: We reached the end of our question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to D. G. Macpherson for closing comments.
D. G. Macpherson: All right, thanks everybody for joining us today. As you probably gathered, we’re very pleased with the momentum of the business and where we’re headed. In U.S., our value proposition is really resonating with customers of all sizes and types, and we’re getting strong tractions with those customers. The turnaround in Canada is going as we expected it to go, lots of reason to be optimistic there. Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion. And our international portfolio is much stronger, it’s contributing to earnings and we’ve seen decent growth there as well. And we continue to get strong expense leverage across the business and we’re on track to achieve the targets we set for ourselves last November. So all-in-all, we feel very positive. We’re well positioned to gain share and improve the economics of the business going forward. And we appreciate the time today. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations for W.W. Grainger. Thank you, Ms. Brown. You may begin. 
Laura Brown: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Laura Brown. Welcome to Grainger’s Q4 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Tom Okray, who will assume the CFO role on May 2nd. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today’s call with the corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q1 press release, which is available on our Investor Relations Web site. D.G. will be covering the performance for the quarter, as well as give an update on our 2018 guidance. After that, we will open for questions. D. G. to you.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, thanks for joining us everyone. Earlier this month, we announced that we had concluded our CFO search. And I'm excited to welcome Tom Okray to Grainger. Tom brings great combination of finance and operations experience with him. He knows our industry well and we're glad to him as part of team. So moving on to the quarter. The momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued into the first quarter of 2018. In the U.S., the volume response to our pricing reset was strong; the demand environment continued to improve. We estimate market growth in the quarter was closer to 4% versus our expectations for 2% to 3% growth for the year. What's encouraging is we're strengthening relationships with both large and mid-sized customers, the pricing reset is allowing us to reestablish trust and gain share by focusing on creating value for our customers. In Canada, our actions related to the turnaround led to gross profit and operating earnings improvement, and our business model reset is on track. Finally, our single channel online and our international businesses expanded operating earnings in the quarter. All this resulted in performance that was better than our expectations. We're raising our full year guidance based on our performance in the first quarter and our confidence moving forward. On Slide 4, let's take a look at our results. Q1, 2018 reported results included restructuring charges of $8 million and an $0.11 negative impact to EPS. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Total Company sales in the quarter were up 9%. Volume was up 8%. We had positive seasonal sales of 1%, mostly in the U.S., offset by 1% decline due to our Techni-Tool divestiture last July. Price was down 1% in the quarter and we have currency favorability of 2% in the quarter driven by strengthening of almost all international currencies in the markets that we participate. Our normalized gross profit rate declined 30 basis points after adjusting for the revenue recognition, accounting change and a benefit from the timing of our national sales meeting. GP rate was better than expected, driven by U.S. mix, price cost spreads and some Canada price increases, which I'll describe in a bit. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volumes. This all led to operating earnings growth of 19% in the quarter. One note, despite the operating earnings growth in the quarter, operating cash flow declined approximately 19%. This was primarily due to full bonus and incentive payments relative to the prior year. This is specific to the first quarter and we expect cash flow to be strong throughout the balance of the year. I'll cover other businesses category first. As a reminder, other businesses include our single channel online model and our international businesses. Sales for this group were up 18% in the quarter, 12% of that was price volume and 6% was currency. Our online businesses continue to drive strong growth and profitability. And our international businesses performed ahead of our expectations as a group and continue to operating margin expansion in the quarter. Turning to Canada, sales were down 2%, and down 6% in local currency. We introduced price increases in the fourth quarter of last year, and as result, price was up 7%. This helped gross profit by 400 basis points in the quarter. Volume was down 13% due to the planned price increases and branch closures. As we've talked about before, this is going to be a smaller but more profitable business when we’re through with the reset and before we can start growing again. Operating margin was better than expected due primarily to a higher GP rate and cost management. Everything that we've seen so far in Canada tells us we’re on the right path. We’re improving our large customer profitability. We've continued our restructuring actions, including closing 17 unproductive branches in the quarter, and we expect to see expenses come down more through to remainder of the year as we structure and create North American centers of excellence. We're also improving service while doing this. Direct-to-customer shipping was at an all-time high in March in Canada. We are making strong progress on all of our initiatives. And while it's too to declare victory, we remain committed to the plan that we laid out in November. Turning to the U.S., both the volume response to our pricing actions and the demand environment was better than we expected. Sales in the U.S. were up 8%. This included volume of 9%, intercompany sales of 1%, seasonal sales of positive 1% and that was offset by the 1% decline due to the Techni-Tool divestiture last July. Price deflation in the quarter was 2%. Our normalized gross profit rate in the U.S. declined 60 basis points after adjusting for the revenue recognition change, and a benefit from the timing of our national sales meeting. Our gross profit rate benefited from volume mix and price cost spread in the quarter. Large customer gross profit was better than we expected, we’re not having to deeply discount any frequently repurchased items as much as customers get more comfortable with our pricing level, and our customers are starting to trust that our prices are relevant and understand the value that we provide. Operating expenses in the U.S. were up 2% once we include the revenue recognition change, and operating margin was better than expected in the quarter as expense leverage on 9% volume growth more than offset the GP rate decline. So turning to our performance in the U.S. and focusing on margin and mid-size customers. We are continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and mid-size customers when we remove pricing as a barrier. We're gaining share and seeing volume growth with all customer groups. U.S. large volume increased 7% versus the prior year, which was above our expectations. Mid-size customer volume also exceeded expectations with growth of 30% over the prior year. With mid-size customers we’re seeing progress with our marketing efforts. We’re further penetrating existing customers, re-engaging lapsed customers and starting to acquire new customers. What's also encouraging is we’re starting to see increased traffic in our branches and our sales reps are now having more value based conversations with customers, which help us solidify our relationships. We remain optimistic for the U.S. business in 2018. Turning to guidance. Page 10 covers our updated guidance for the year. In January, we had shared what was on the left side of the chart. For the year, we had expected 3% to 7% sales growth, minus 2% to 6% operating earnings growth and 13% to 24% EPS growth. We now expect sales growth of 5% to 8% for the year, operating earnings growth of 6% to 14% and EPS growth of 25% to 33%. The new revenue guidance is driven by better price deflation on market based price increases and better mix, along with improved currency. The strong volume performance in the U.S. will be offset by lower volume in Canada as we execute the turnaround. Operating margin is now expected to be 11.1% to 11.5% on improved GP rate and expense productivity. I wanted to give a little bit more detail on our performance in Q1 versus our new guidance for the year. For simplicity, I'll refer to the midpoint of our guidance ranges. We expect momentum to continue in 2018. The shape of our growth curve hasn't changed. We still expect higher growth in the first half of the year; although, a whole curve has risen on higher expected sales growth for the year. Some of the favorability that we saw with GP expense in the first quarter was one-off in nature, and we don't expect it to repeat. I'll talk about that in a minute. And we decided to maintain our expectations for Canada's 2018 operating margin despite better performance in Q1. We are cautiously optimistic about Canada, but it's too early to adjust our expectations. So let's take a closer look at our performance in Q1. EPS exceeded our expectations by $0.75 in the quarter, $0.20 was U.S. volume and price, and we expect that to repeat each of the next three quarters. Another $0.45 was one-off in nature, and we expect it not to repeat. That include the tax benefit from stock-based awards some international business favorability, the timing of certain contract negotiations and a change in accounting estimate in the U.S. And finally, $0.10 of our beat is timing related and will reverse in the year and this includes Canada's favorability. So this gets us from the original 13.55 to 14.08 at the midpoint. And finally, before opening up to questions, I wanted to spend just a moment on price cost spread in the U.S. We previously had expected a price headwind of 2% for the year, that 2% was a net number composed of negative 3% from the wrap round of our August 2017 pricing reset, which was offset by plus 1% from favorable mix and market based price increases. Today, we are updating the total price headwind to minus 1.5%. The make-up the still minus 3 from our pricing actions, but we now expect the price mix to improve. We still expect 50 basis points of COGS deflation for the year, driven by our internal product cost initiatives like PPO as same as we indicated with our prior guidance. COGS deflation was much more favorable in the quarter due in part to timing from our national sales meeting. We expect COGS deflation to moderate through remainder of the year. In summary, overall, we're very pleased with our progress. Our pricing changes in U.S. are resulting in strong growth with gross margin rates above our expectations. We're developing strong relationships with customers of all sizes. We're moving very fast in Canada and seeing signs of progress. Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion, and our international businesses are contributing to earnings. We continue to get strong expense leverage across the business, and we are on track to achieve the productivity targets that we laid out at Analyst Day in November. And we are well positioned to gain share and improve our economics going forward. So with that, I'll open it up for any questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn: Digging into the U.S. medium customer, I was interested in the staging of the customer acquisition levers that you plan to pull, what's the attraction there so far versus the reengagement what you've felt dormant customers.
D. G. Macpherson: As I mentioned, there are really three sources to that growth; one is getting more share with active customers; another is reengaging lapsed customers who've been customers in the past; and the third is the acquisition piece. We're going to spend time talking about more details in the near future. But we’re seeing growth across all three of those. I would say we’re still fairly early days in the new customer acquisition piece, but we have dedicated some marketing dollars to acquire new customers, and we've seen we've seen good response with that.
Christopher Glynn: And then the U.S. margins up 120. Just wondering if you could disaggregate that beyond how we could triangulate from the slide, just in terms of the ongoing upside versus the timing of the contract negotiations? And I think you said the accounting change had a little more impact in the first quarter?
D. G. Macpherson: So the accounting change does not have an impact on operating earnings. It's just shifts from GP to expense. When we look at what we saw in the first quarter, we're obviously happy with the expense leverage we're getting. And we're happy with what we're seeing from the customer response, both from a volume and from a price point level. So without going into too much detail, there were some elements that we talked about in detail that will not repeat that are in that number, but a lot of the benefit we think is real from the U.S.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David Manthey: Am I understanding it right that your net pricing is coming up a bit, because market pricing is higher and some of your prices to your customers change contractually. Is that what you just say?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. So it's not all contractual, but what we've seen is, given some commodity price increase, we've seen some market prices creep up, and we've been able to take those. And our COGS performance has been better than those price increases. So effectively for us, that shows our best price cost spread and we think we’re going to have a little favorability for the year relative to what we originally expected.
David Manthey: And then as it relates to your price reset parameters. If market prices, more broadly adjust over the year, does that incrementally make your level of pricing more competitive and could that be some of what we're seeing or is it just too early to say that that's what's going on or to small in magnitude?
D. G. Macpherson: So just as a reminder, so our pricing philosophy is to price to market and we've gotten prices to what we think are the right market levels. If market prices go up, we will watch that closely and make some adjustments. We're seeing two benefits, one is a little bit of inflation and the other is from our customer mix where we're seeing growth with attractive customers at higher margins and with attractive volumes sources within existing customers as well. So there is really two going on, one is the inflation benefit that we get and the other is customer mix benefit.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.
Ryan Merkel: So first question for me just back to the non-repeating items that you called out. Can you just add a little more color to each piece? And then I'm hoping that you can quantify each component of the $0.45?
D. G. MacPherson: So let me just describe. So tax benefit from stock-based awards, that's pretty clear. I think the one that's probably not, maybe not as obviously, is we had a change in accounting estimate, that's really we had a number of customers who have been on cash accountings, because we were very conservative. And when we looked at their credit risk, it's similar to rest of the business. We made a change that's going to now be an accrual system. So that's a modest portion of the $0.45. But that's the one that probably is a little bit odd, the others are fairly self-explanatory. And we're not providing necessarily the detail on the each -- the impact of each of those at this point.
Ryan Merkel: And then on gross margin, the quarterly cadence for year is a little different than I was thinking. There is some noise I guess in the first quarter’s gross margin. But can you just clarify, how much gross margins declined sequentially into the second quarter? And then could you also comment on the trend line, is it stable to slightly rising sequentially from the second quarter?
D. G. MacPherson: So the things that were unusual in the quarter, Ryan, one is the timing of our sales meeting. And so we would expect the second quarter to be slightly lower, because that benefit was in the first quarter and won't be in the second quarter. It will be an offset effectively. Other than that, things are actually I think pretty stable with our GP rate.
Ryan Merkel: So just one more follow up, I guess. So should mix and improving price help gross margins as we think about the second half of this year and entering 2019, is that still the plan?
D. G. MacPherson: Well, that's why we changed our expectations on GP, because of the customer mix and the inflation and that's why we've raised the U.S. 0.5 percentage point. So yes, that's absolutely the expectation for the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. 
Robert Barry: I just wanted to actually follow up on that. I mean, big picture it doesn't seem like your view on the gross margin performance is changing that much. Is that right? I mean, you still expect it down 110 and that was 130 last quarter?
D. G. MacPherson: Yes, that's right. 
Robert Barry: And I think the math, if you were down 60 in the first quarter, would actually imply a fair amount more pressure in the remaining quarters to be down 110 for the year. Your answer to the last question about just a modest, what sounded like a modest noise from the prior accounting suggested that in fact it could be a lot better than that. So I'm just trying to understand, I guess just a clarification on the cadence?
D. G. MacPherson: We actually think it’s going to be fairly stable. It's all really the sales meeting driving that difference. So it was a fairly significant benefit in the first quarter. And so when you take that out, there is really not sequential down really.
Robert Barry: So just to clarify, you do think the gross margin will be down a little bit in the second quarter versus or maybe fair amount in the second quarter versus first quarter. And then it will remain stable?
D. G. MacPherson: No, we’re not. And we’re not giving quarterly guidance on GP, we don’t do that. So we’ll talk more about it as we go forward. But we would say that the one thing we wanted to highlight is the timing of the sales meeting. We also had some benefit from COGS deflation in the quarter that was better than we had expected. Some of that is actually timing as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Scott Graham: I wanted to beat the dead horse here, the $0.45. How does the timing of contract negotiations -- how specifically does that translate into something positive? Is there some backdating there or how does that work?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, if the contracts push out and we don’t get them completed, then we haven’t lowered the price for our customer yet. And so that’s why it’s a benefit that we don’t expect to continue, because we will complete those contracts.
Scott Graham: And it looks to me like your revenue recognition change analysis in the back is exclusively about the revenue recognition. So the gross profit that you show here is not reflective of this, whatever piece of the $0.45 is, yes?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, right. We’re only talked two separate things, we’re talking about revenue recognition in the back that’s the accounting standard change that we talked about before. I think you are asking a question about the accounting change for revenue recognition for some form of the cash based customers, that’s a very -- that’s a small piece of the $0.45, it’s separate.
Scott Graham: That’s a small piece, which would make the timing of the contract negotiations a larger base?
D. G. Macpherson: There is a number of pieces that add up to the $0.45 and that does all contribute.
Scott Graham: And my last question is I don’t know how closely you guys have looked at some of the tariffing, I’ll call it, going on out there, U.S., China, even a little bit of Russia. I was just wondering if you guys are looking this lay of the land, how this affects you?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, so we have looked at it. We will continue to look at it. It’s a little bit unclear yet that the impact it’s going to have on some of categories we participate in. We look at it two ways; one is understanding the financials the other is making sure that we’ve got the right decision on sourcing. And depending on certain tariffs, we may lose suppliers as well. So we don’t have a conclusion. Obviously, certain tariffs will be very inflationary for the market and others might not. And so we’re looking at the specifics to understand what we will need to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Robert McCarthy: Well, what a difference a year makes. Good job in the quarter, and I don’t want to be a Grinch, but I feel get asked some questions along those lines. I guess, the question I would have is how should we think about your embedded guidance in the back half of the year for revenue growth around anniversarying these compares, particularly as your pricing reset. And then I guess the question is, how do you think the situation? Do you think you’re going to have to have some further price cuts as you get price discovery or what’s embedded in your guidance with respect to further pricing actions if you anniversary volumes and you don’t see quite the demand response you saw for the first half of the year?
D. G. Macpherson: So let me break that in two buckets. I would say one of the things we're seeing is that for large contract customers, our pricing has always been competitive and so we're not seeing substantial GP rate contraction with large customers. I think it's relatively business as usual. I think we're going to execute well, and we still have a lot of growth with large customers. Mid-size customers, what were findings is that price points we’re at are actually good for both acquiring customers and reengaging relapse customers, and we have not reached yet a large portion of that market. So I feel like we have a fairly long runway to grow with midsize customers, and certain large customers where we haven’t historically had contract. So while we've always said the back half of the year will be lower revenue growth, because of the comparisons, we feel like we’re well positioned to continue to gain share.
Robert McCarthy: And just as a follow-up in terms of brass packs, I mean what are do you expect -- what you can share about the business, the EPG time frame, because I think you are not disclosing monthly sales anymore. You will be out at some of the conferences. But what do think will be the mid quarter update topic around, we’ll be traction of U.S. medium-size, we’ll be talking about Gamut, we’ll be talking about the back half. Just try to set this table for what are going to do the key topics, because we're stuck because the submarine goes down for about a month and a half before we -- or a months before we speak with you again.
D. G. Macpherson: So I think the two topics are going to be; one mid-size customers understanding a little bit more detail what we're seeing with that with that group; and the other will be around digital broadly. So I think those will be the topics that we focused on that will be additive and new.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Baumann: Can you just talk about -- looks like that the slides you pulled out the commentary on monthly daily sales by segment. I'm just curious has U.S. segment progressed by month through the quarter? And really the question along the lines of your commentary around the expected second half volume slowing and I'm guessing that's just comps. But I was just curious if you saw anything intra-quarter that makes you stick with that forecast?
D. G. Macpherson: No, I mean they really were very minor changes in terms of the demand environment and volume throughout the quarter, throughout the entire business.
Patrick Baumann: On the MRO market, you said up 3 to 4 now versus 2 to 3. Is that really what's driving the increase in the U.S. volume growth expectations from 6 to 7, it's the market?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. So the market is a big portion of that and we're also seeing some higher share gain with midsize customers for sure than we expected, and with large customer as well. So it's a bit of market and share gain.
Patrick Baumann: And then on the price cost, the change from 1.5% to 1%. What's the U.S. segment margin guidance now for the year? Is it just 50 basis points better than it was before? And just curious on that price cost. Is that going to exit the year in your current planning as a positive contributor in the fourth quarter?
D. G. Macpherson: So in terms of GP rate, we're 20 basis points better than we were previously in terms of what we expect for the U.S.
Patrick Baumann: In GP, but I was talking total segment margins?
D. G. Macpherson: On earnings…
Patrick Baumann: Margin guidance for the year segment, you gave guidance…
D. G. Macpherson: We haven't given margin guidance for the year for the U.S. segment. No, we're anticipating -- no, we're obviously encouraged by what we’re seeing.
Patrick Baumann: And then price cost for the year exiting 4Q. I mean, do you think it will be positive?
D. G. Macpherson: I think you may be asking two questions simultaneously. So what we talked about is our reset this year is going to be 200 basis points decrement. And then we talked about positive price cost above that. And so yes, price costs are going to be positive for the year for sure. It will happen to going into next year, we'll start talking about that later in the year as we would expect that 300 basis points to go -- hoping much smaller and we’ll probably won't talk about that really until November.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dean Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray: I wanted to follow up -- what's also interesting from this call I feel little badly for D.G., because you have to answer as a CEO and CFO at the same time. So I appreciate that, it’s a little more challenging but lot of good color here. I want to go back to price cost, if I could. Just to reference early in your prepared remarks about mix has had a benefit here. And maybe give us some examples of how mix enters into this. I guess, intuitively you would think that you're not selling as much as of those products that have the deepest price discounts. But maybe you can just clarify provide some color there, please.
D. G. Macpherson: Deane, I think most of the benefit we're actually seeing is customer mix. So the fact that mid-size customers have generally higher GP rates and are less on negotiated prices than large customers. And so historically the last six or seven years, we've been growing large contract volumes faster than mid-size customers that has reversed, and so you get some positive mix benefit on the GP.
Deane Dray: And then in Canada, the ability to put 7% price increase. How does that compare or maybe it's completely different market, but you pricing power in Canada compared to the market and versus pricing strategy in the U.S. Where is the breaking point for you in Canada?
D. G. Macpherson: So I think it's really not even close to a comparison. The reality is that as we went through our ERP implementation in Canada and the Canadian dollar few years ago went down, we did not pass through price increases that the rest of the market did. So we got to a position where prices are well below market. And as we've improved our service and come out of that, we've been able to pass some of those prices through. So it's really not even analogous situation at all today.
Deane Dray: Just let me -- if I can sneak one more in. Any color on Cromwell?
D. G. Macpherson: Cromwell is performing as expected at this point. We've made a bunch of changes to that business. We've read on the supply chain, which is performing much better, put in a new Web site and that's performing better. But it's performing as expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your questions.
Ryan Cieslak: My first question, D.G., is when you look at the guidance on the price COGS or the gross margin I think you guys are looking at price deflation or COGS deflation around 50 basis points. It seems like that’s consistent now for the balance of the year. Is that the case? And if it is, can you just help us maybe understand maybe some of the offsets that you’re able to deploy as it relates to maybe as we’re hearing more about inflation pressures throughout the industrial supply chain right now?
D. G. Macpherson: And I’ve talked about this before. If we had not have the initiatives we had, we would have had COGS inflation this year of 2%, 3%, 4%, somewhere in that range. And so our own efforts around line reviews, managing COGS, PPO, we call PPO that’s basically going through and understanding the cost of our products and working with suppliers to get the right assortment and the right cost. Those efforts have had a significant impact, and that’s why we expect slightly negative COGS inflation this year.
Ryan Cieslak: And D. G., I mean would it be fair to assume though you’re having maybe better benefits from some of stuff considering it seems like inflation over the last couple of months has picked more and certainly maybe some of the tariffs that could be rolling through as well?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, and so I think I would probably tease those into two. One is I think we’re getting the benefit we expected. I don’t know that’s necessarily better than we expected, it’s quite an important benefit or one that the team has done a nice job of. I think in terms of things like tariffs that would be something the whole market would see and we would then be raising price to offset those if in fact those tariffs were to become reality. So we’re watching those closely. That would be a separate issue generally.
Ryan Cieslak: And then for my follow up and thinking about the incremental gross margin or gross profit contribution from medium size volume growth for you guys. Does that change at all going forward as you start to see new customer acquisition pick up in that overall mix of incremental volume, meaning maybe cost to serve those new customers is going to be a little bit higher than gaining incremental volume from existing customers? Thanks.
D. G. Macpherson: We’ll probably talk about that as we go forward. I think the incremental margins on that mid size customer are strong obviously, which is great. New customer acquisition does have a little bit different economics, although it would still be very positive to the business we believe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Dankert: Just want to get quick update on Canada. I believe the expectation was getting margin to a positive number, and exiting the year on a run rate basis. Is 4% still the bogie or just given how that’s rolled out, that’s have been pushed further into ’19 at this point?
D. G. Macpherson: No that’s still -- we have the exact same expectations we had in November for the Canadian business at this point. That has not changed.
Chris Dankert: And then I guess if you just expand a bit on freight. Obviously, we’ve seen those numbers go up quite a bit. Has any of the cost indications then on that aspect how successful that has been? And then just any color around freight would be really helpful?
D. G. Macpherson: So I think to understand freight impact, you have to understand how our freight works. In U.S., most of our orders actually go through parcel, although not necessarily most of the dollars. And we do not own our own fleet. So we use third parties. We have contracts with third-parties. Certainly, for truckload and less than truckload volume, there is a lot of upward freight pressure right now. We don't do a whole lot of truckload and we do some LTL. And so we are actively managing that. Certainly, there's some upward pressure. We probably have managed it well, so far, I would say and we’re watching it very closely.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Evelyn Chow: This is actually Evelyn Chow from Goldman. Maybe just starting on 1Q, I just want to make sure we have a good handle on the moving parts on gross margin. So specifically as it relates to the trade show and the COGS deflation, what benefit did you actually get in the quarter from that?
D. G. Macpherson: About 20 basis points in the quarter from that.
Evelyn Chow: And then just turning to the timing of the contract renegotiations, it would be helpful to get some rationale as to the decision to defer. Is it decision to maybe think about different customer accounts that you’re targeting, is it a reflection of the pricing or demand environment? It would be helpful just to understand what push that out.
D. G. Macpherson: This is not our decision at all. This is just customer processes potentially taking longer than we have thought they might take. So we aren’t deferring anything. These are customer processes that are taking time to work through.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question. 
Justin Bergner: Maybe you could just talk about the other businesses a bit. How is Zoro performing, any trends there or any of those sub components?
D. G. Macpherson: I would say that the online businesses continue to grow very strongly, and continue to have strong margins. They’re performing as we would expect. The international piece of the portfolio really is a much narrower piece of the portfolio, it's Cromwell, Fabory, China, Mexico and some export business at this point. So we've gone through a fairly long process of cleaning up that portfolio. And the good news is that is all profitable and contributing to profitability for the company. So we feel good about having the right portfolio at this time.
Justin Bergner: And then any change to your long-term capital allocation, medium term capital allocation plans with this improved guidance. I know that you continue to repurchase shares fairly actively. But any change there?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, I'm going to let Tom get more than three days under his belt before we dive into that. But we’re not changing anything right now, but we will continue to talk to our board about long-term capital allocation as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Hamzah Mazari: The first question, D.G., is just you mentioned you have not reached a large portion of the medium customer market, which suggest you’re in early innings of share gain. I was hoping you could maybe share some data points around maybe what was your market share in 2011. Last time you grew with medium customers, or maybe some other data points to verify that you haven't reached the large portion of that market, what's your customer account versus overall medium customer account. Any data points to help us understand sustainability of share gains in that segment?
D. G. Macpherson: I think I would point to a couple of things. One is we were $1.5 billion to $2 billion in mid-size customers at one point, which is probably 3% or 4% market share, we’re down to 2% now. So that's -- it's small in either case but we think we can certainly grow share. We think there are $0.5 million of attractive mid-size customer we have relationships with $60,000 plus of them. So we feel like there is a long runway of mid-size customers to acquire and to build relationships with.
Hamzah Mazari: And then just on the COGS deflation. Is the PPO project covered all your SKUs? Is that project behind you? I know we didn't have this project in 2016. I don't know if we had it last year. But just any color as to -- is that project behind you now and we’re seeing the benefits of that or is there more room to go in terms of other SKUs or revenue to cover?
D. G. Macpherson: So it’s been ongoing for several years. And it was a little bit new way of thinking about how we manage our assortment in COGS. I would say that every year, we run different processes for different parts of the portfolio. In some cases, the much simpler part of the process and some cases, it's more involved like PPO. But we're certainly not done, we're going to continue to work on the assortment and we always start with the assortment, and the cost of that assortment. And so that will be a consistent process for us.
Hamzah Mazari: And just to follow up. Did you guys have any impact from -- I know you don't give much details. But any impacts from Easter or weather in your Q1? Thank you.
D. G. Macpherson: So Easter would have been a very small impact and probably not worth talking about. I would say, the weather, we had 1% increase in seasonal sales a lot of that was nor Easters it’s just pounding or I guess the East. So that was most of that in March.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Duncan with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. 
Matt Duncan: So first thing I've got, I'm hoping you can give us a little bit of clarity here on gross margin. So your guide before has been a 130 basis point decline with the 70 bp drag from the accounting change, it’s now 110 basis point decline with only a 50 bp drag implying that the underlying gross margin hasn't really changed. And yet you're updating in a positive way the price cost spread in the U.S. So how do we reconcile those two things together?
D. G. Macpherson: So net-net the expectation is that the underlying GP will be 20 basis points better than we had said back in the fourth quarter.
Matt Duncan: But there is a 50 bp better in U.S. price cost spread. So is there somewhere else in the business where gross margins are a little lower than you thought before?
D. G. Macpherson: No, that’s just the impact of that 50 bp. 50 basis points of price equals 20 basis points of GP.
Matt Duncan: And then just in terms of what you're seeing so far D. G. with organic Gamut. Can you give us any update on where you are in the roll-out of Gamut and what you're seeing in there?
D. G. Macpherson: Well if you call, we're actually merging Gamut and Grainger.com and building a lot of those capabilities into Grainger.com at this point. The team is working to build those capabilities and we'll provide a bit of an update at EPG in May.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. 
Steve Barger: With medium customer growth running the way it is, I'm curious if the incremental volumes coming through the digital channel are more through inside sales reps and how much room do you have in terms of inside sales capacity?
D. G. Macpherson: So it’s coming in both places and we’re seeing nice growth with the covered customers through inside sales. But we’re seeing very high growth through digital channels as well, so it’s really coming in both places. We have capacity in inside sales and we will add capacity if that makes sense, so we are not constrained if we’re getting profitable growth. But so far, we’re seeing it both places and really just continuing to dive and understand the sources of benefit.
Steve Barger: And based on the 4Q presentation, free cash flow guidance $810 million to $850 million for the year. 1Q came in it at $97 million even with less than 25% of the projected CapEx for the year. I know it typically ramps through the year. Can you talk about how you see free cash flow coming in given the early trends?
D. G. Macpherson: We expect it to be at the higher end of that range for the year, the range we talked about before.
Operator: Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Bergner: On the gross margin 20 basis points improvement. Is that almost all mix towards medium customers or is some of that general price cost?
D. G. Macpherson: It’s a little bit of both. It’s a combination of both.
Justin Bergner: And then what’s driving the price cost just the better end market environment that’s allowing you to get a better spread there or are there other factors?
D. G. Macpherson: Market price increase is due to inflation and our ability to not take those in product cost that difference.
Operator: We have a follow up question from the line of Patrick Baumann with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Baumann: I just have one more and I know this question has been asked a bunch of times in the call, and I am not sure I quite understood the answer yet. So the U.S. segment margin in the first quarter was 16.7 and it does include some favorability from items that you don’t expect to repeat for the year. is this timing related or something? What’s the underling margin in the first quarter ex those items, can you give color on that?
D. G. Macpherson: We don’t give color on that typically, it was good though.
Patrick Baumann: And maybe just last question just on the capital allocation priorities. Will there be a relook for the new CFO coming in, or how does that typically work?
D. G. Macpherson: I would assume that the CFO we want to relook at pretty much everything. So yes, I would expect it would be a relook. I don’t know when the timing will occur.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Belfiore with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Belfiore: So I just wanted to touch on a couple of things that have - you talked a little bit about. So just in terms of the pricing increases versus mix and on the 1.5% full year. Can you provide a little bit of color in terms of the mix portion of that versus the price?
D. G. Macpherson: No, I mean both are significant contributors but we’re not providing that level of detail.
Chris Belfiore: And then in terms of reaching the larger remaining portion of the medium customer base. What are the initiatives that gives you the confidence that that’s achievable? And how much of that is factored into longer term 6% plus volume growth that you guys are expecting?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, I mean our expectation is that a lot of that will be through digital means initially where we acquire customers through digital meter and then figure out how to best serve them. I think what we're seeing with some other digital efforts so far gives us confidence that that will be a positive contributor. And certainly, we made the change with the idea of reengaging existing customers and driving more volume through existing customers, and we reengaging lapse customers and acquire new customers, so all of that is important to our expectations going forward.
Chris Belfiore: And that’s factored into the volume growth expectations that you guys have given or is that like above and beyond that?
D. G. Macpherson: It's factored in although it's not a big portion of the 6% in the next couple of years, the expectation is longer term and that will become a bigger portion of it.
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Macpherson for closing comments.
D. G. Macpherson: Thanks everybody for joining us. Obviously, we're very pleased with our progress in the U.S. We're pleased that pricing changes are resulting in strong growth with gross margin rates above expectations. I think we're probably most pleased with the fact that we’re really developing stronger relationships with customers and all different types of customers. In Canada, we like the progress we've made to-date, still a lot of work to go, but we really see signs of progress and we're excited to get that business back to a profitable state. And then our online model continues to drive great revenue and profitable growth, and our international businesses are all contributing. And we’re very happy with the expense leverage we've seen and continue to focus, we will continue to focus on making sure that we spend money wisely to drive growth and to serve our customers, and to improve our productivity. So we feel like we are really well positioned to gain share, improve our economics going forward. And thanks for being with us today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Laura Brown: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Grainger’s Q4 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Ron Jadin, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking based on our current view of future events, actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today’s call with the corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q4 press release, which is available on our Investor Relations web site. D.G. will be covering the performance for the quarter, as well as give an update on our 2018 guidance. After that, we’ll open for questions. D. G. to you.
D. G. Macpherson: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We know it is a busy earnings day and we appreciate you being on the call. So, 2017 was an important year for Grainger. We took action to become more relevant to our customers and to compete more aggressively in the market. We also saw the market grow for the first time since 2014. In 2017, we announced a significant change to our pricing structure in the U.S. Pricing has been a barrier to our growth both with large and mid-size customers. This was a very complex change that required a lot of work, lot of collaboration, and great execution to pull off. I am extremely proud of our team members for executing the way that they have this year and the results show clearly in the fourth quarter 2017 numbers. We saw our performance accelerate through the back half of the year, which is very encouraging. We executed the pricing change, while continuing to focus on making sure we create value for our customers. In 2017, we also launched a new R&D website called Gamut, with a new way to think about product search. Given the positive early customer feedback we plan to combine the capabilities of Gamut with those of our industry-leading website Grainger.com to create the most powerful industrial website in the market. In Canada, we laid the foundation for a complete business model reset and that began in late 2017. We are improving our service to customers, do more consistent direct-to-customer shipping. We are improving Canada’s cost structure through branch reductions and the creation of North American centers of excellence, and we are improving our profitability to price increases and improve large customer solutions. We are now starting to see the benefits of that work, which I’ll discuss later in the call. Finally, in 2017, we announced a plan to take $150 million to $210 million of cost out of the business from 2018 and 2019. We continue to make strong progress on that plan. The actions and execution in 2017 reflect the culture we are reinforcing at Grainger. Everything we do is focused on delivering value to our customers in the most efficient and effective way possible. We are entering 2018 with a solid foundation. With that, let’s take a look at our results for the year. 2017 reported results included adjustments resulting in $112 million impact to operating earnings and a $1.44 impact to EPS. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which includes the items outlined in our press release. Looking at a total company adjusted results, sales increased 3% versus the prior year and gross profit dollars were flat. Operating expenses increased 3%, operating earnings were down 8%, and operating cash flow increased 3% for the year. Turning to the quarter, our adjusted results for the quarter were better than expectations, total company sales in the quarter were up 7% that was made up of volume of 11% that was partially offset by price, which was down 3%. We also had a 1% decline due to our specialty businesses divestiture in the U.S. Gross profit dollars increased 4% as volume growth outpaced price deflation. Gross profit margin was better than expected due to the U.S. performance and Canada price increases. We also realized expense leverage on higher volume. Operating expenses increased 4% on volume of 11%. All of that led to operating earnings growth of 4% in the quarter. I’ll start by covering our other business category first. Other businesses include our online model and our international businesses. Sales were up 16%, which was almost entirely volume. Our online businesses, which include Zoro in the US and MonotaRO in Japan continue to drive strong growth and profitability. Our international businesses performed in line with our expectations as a group and contributed to operating margin expansion in the quarter. Turning to Canada, sales were up 5%, were flat in local currency. We introduced price increases in the second half of the quarter and we’re happy with the response. Price was up 4% for the quarter, volume was down 4% for the quarter. Volume was down due to price increases and branch closures in the quarter. Overall, revenue was slightly better than our own expectations. Operating expenses increased 2% in local currency versus the prior year as we made investments initiating the turnaround in Canada. Operating margin was better than expected in the quarter, due primarily to a higher gross profit rate as a result of the price increases and a benefit from inventory adjustments. As you know, we are in the midst of a substantial transformation of the business in Canada. We are moving very quickly to reset the business. We are closing unproductive branches. We are leveraging the U.S. business more to North American centers of excellence. We are improving service by leveraging our distribution network in Canada and the U.S. We are improving our large customer contact performance. I would say we’re making strong progress on all of these initiatives. We remain committed to the plan we laid out in November for 2018 for the business. We did get more benefits earlier than expected in the quarter. Turning to the U.S., we continue to see strong volume response to our pricing actions and we continue to see an improved demand environment. Sales were up 5%. This included volume growth of 11%, and price deflation of 5%. The demand environment has been consistently strong the last few months. Operating expenses in the U.S. were up 2%, showing leverage on 11% volume growth. Operating margin was better than expected in the quarter as expense leverage partially offset the decline in the GP rate. Turning to more specifics in the U.S., we’re continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and mid-size customers when we remove pricing as a barrier. U.S. large customer volume increased 8% versus the prior year and 300 basis points sequentially. We ended 2017 having renegotiated about 80% of our contract revenue. We will continue to work on the remaining contracts in 2018. As planned the remaining contracts will be negotiated as renewals come up. Large customers spot by and large noncontract customers both had stronger volume growth than the average for large customers in the quarter. U.S. mid-size customers continue to exceed our expectations, mid-size customer volume increased 26% over the prior year at 800 basis points sequentially. We’re seeing progress with our marketing efforts and progress against all mid-size customer groups. We are further penetrating existing customers. We are re-engaging lapsed customers, and we are acquiring new customers. For the first time in a long time, we are seeing significant mid-size volume growth at attractive margins. Overall, we remain quite optimistic for the U.S. business heading into 2018. I wanted to briefly remind you of our expectations for driving productivity in the business, while improving the customer experience. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to get strong expense leverage in the quarter driven by strong volume performance and our diligent managing expenses. We continue to be focused on improving our cost structure and focusing on the things that matter the most. Our targets for cost takeout have not changed. We continue to expect cost takeout and productivity of $90 million and $120 million in the U.S.; $50 million to $70 million in Canada; and $10 million to $20 million in the other areas of the business. Based on our performance in 2017 and our momentum, we’re on track to achieve our productivity targets going forward. Now, let’s take a look at 2018 guidance I’ll talk about the midpoint of guidance on this slide. If you recall, we shared at the Analyst Day in November, on the left side on the chart, from 2017 to 2018 at that point we expected 5% sales growth, 5% operating earnings growth, and 5% EPS growth. As we discussed, our 2017 actual results exceeded expectations that coupled with tax reform has altered our outlook for 2018. We still expect sales growth of 5%, but now we anticipate operating earnings growth of 2% that’s due to two things. The first is our decision to increase our digital investments with the portion of the excess cash that will result from a lower tax rate; and the second is our decision to maintain our expectations for Canada’s 2018 operating margin despite better performance in the fourth quarter, just too early to build in that benefit in 2018. The bottom-line is that we expect both higher sales and earnings dollars and a higher operating margin in 2018 and we suggested in November given the momentum that we’re seeing. In addition, our EPS is now expected to grow 18% versus prior year. In the appendix you will find a slide that outlines the new revenue recognition accounting standards that requires to reclassify certain service costs from operating expense to cost of goods sold beginning in 2018. There is no impact to operating margin as a result of that change. Taking a closer look, a little bit more detail on our operating margin and EPS guidance for 2018 compared to what we showed in November. If you look at our 2017 performance, our outperformance in the second half of Q4 resulted in a 0.4% benefit to operating margin and an almost $0.60 benefit to EPS. As I mentioned, we decided to maintain our expectations for Canada’s operating margin, despite our strong performance in the quarter that resulted in an operating margin of 11%, and an EPS of 11.70%. From there we factored other income incremental items that will occur in 2018. We are expecting a lower tax benefit from our clean energy investments in 2018 then what was originally anticipated, that will be roughly $0.10 negative impact. That will raise our base tax rate from 35% to 36%. So, our corporate tax rate on that base is expected to go from 36% to 24.5% at the midpoint as a result of the new U.S. tax legislation that resulted in a $2.15 benefit to EPS. We also, as I mentioned plan to increase our investments in digital. We will sell accelerate actions to combine Gamut capabilities with Grainger.com and accelerate our progress with our digital offering overall, that has a negative 0.2% impact on operating margin and a negative $0.26 impact to EPS. Finally, we expect to have a $0.06 EPS benefit from additional share repurchases. At the end of all those adjustments, we expect 2018 operating margin to be 10.8%, and earnings per share to be $13.55. Given the changes to the tax rate, we’re updating our cash flow projections for 2018. We now expect to generate $1.1 billion to $1.18 billion of operating cash flow. As I mentioned, we will use some of that excess cash to make investments in our digital platform. The remainder will be used to repurchase additional shares, which reflects our confidence and our strategy going forward. So overall, to summarize, we are very pleased with our progress. We have executed our pricing changes in the U.S. and are seeing strong growth with gross margin rates at our expectations. We are moving fast in Canada and starting to see some early signs of progress. Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion. We’re laser focused on driving performance in our core business. We continue to get strong expense leverage across the business. Our team members have demonstrated throughout this year their ability to create value for our customers even in the midst of what has been a very complicated pricing change and while we still have the financial challenge of lapping our price changes in 2018, we are well positioned to gain share and improve our economics going forward. So, with that, I will open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead with your questions.
Ryan Merkel: Hi thank you, good morning and congratulations on a nice quarter.
D. G. Macpherson: Good morning Ryan. Thank you.
Ryan Merkel: So, first question, the 11% volume growth really stands out. You’ve been talking about 6% to 8%, so two-part question, first, do you view the upside as more a response to your price cuts versus the macro? And then secondly, are you just being conservative by not changing the sales guidance for 2018 at this early stage?
D. G. Macpherson: Right. So, thanks Ryan. I would answer those in succession. So, when we look at the 11% growth in the U.S. certainly part of that is an improving demand environment. It is a meaningful part, but not the majority. The majority is our own pricing and marketing actions driving that. So, certainly there is some demand tailwinds, which are great, but lot of this is just the changes we’ve made. The second part of that is, we're not going to change our projections this time. We are still four months in, five months in understanding what’s going on with the volume response and so we’re going to keep to our projections this time.
Ryan Merkel: Fair enough, but would you also say that there’s no reason you see nothing out there that the 11% or something near that wouldn't be sustainable based on what you’re seeing today?
D. G. Macpherson: What I would say is that, the demand environment has been very consistent the last three months heading into this year. So, there is nothing to suggest things are changing.
Ryan Merkel: Okay. And then, just second question on gross margin and the outlook there down 70 basis points, excluding the accounting, is there any upside from improved price cost? Are you starting to see some inflation from your suppliers?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. We are starting to see some inflation from suppliers and we expect to have some price cost. We’ve already built that in to the projections. I think a lot of what happens with GP rate in the U.S. will be determined by the mix of growth that we get. If we continue to see the mid-size customers and the large non-contract customers grow faster than the average we may have some upside, but we just have to wait and see.
Ryan Merkel: Very good. I’ll pass it on. Thank you.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your questions.
Christopher Glynn: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask another one on gross margin, you know with commodities and supplier inflation on an uptick here, in the context of your repricing strategies is pricing to inflation at odds with continuing to execute the volume response side of pricing?
D. G. Macpherson: No, not really. We will separate those two. So, the pricing actions we have taken, we really are tagging to the market and making sure we are market competitive, and then if market prices increase we will be able to realize that as well, if it is based on inflation. So, we view them as independent. We’re focused on being competitive, but certainly as inflation comes we would expect to realize that as well.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. So, you’re not nervous about a squeeze there, even if it is short lived, it doesn't sound like. And then just a housekeeping item, does the 2018 tax rate guidance reflect the full impact of the bill or is there a more mature run rate that we would pencil in for 2019?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, we are calling this provisional at this point. This is the best to our knowledge at this point, and we think we’ve captured the key elements in the rate.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead with your questions.
Adam Uhlman: Hi, good morning. I was hoping if you could give us some more color on the acceleration and sales growth with the medium-sized customers that you saw? Could you share any data on the active customer count, the re-engagement that you had with customers that had fallen off, has there been any change in the average order sizes, maybe just a little bit more detail so we can better understand the moving pieces there?
Ron Jadin: Yes. So, I won’t provide too much detail on that. I will say that, if you recall, we have a fairly small portion of mid-size customers as customers today. The price change has had more impact with the existing mid-size customers early days, but we are starting to acquire new customers, but I would say our customer acquisition is still pretty nascent. So, it’s really been mostly around existing customers buying more and then what we would call lapse customers, people who knew Grainger rebuying, but we are starting to acquire some new customers as well.
Adam Uhlman: Okay, thanks. And then D. G. could you comment on what you’re seeing so far in your January sales, there has been some difficult weather and government shutdown impacts, maybe how we should be thinking about in the quarter, the cadence as we move through the year?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, I mean it’s too early to comment much about January. We don't feel like the government shutdown is going to have much impact if it gets funded going forward. Obviously, if there is another shutdown that would change things. And the weather events are normal for this time of the year, I think certainly we’ve had days when there has been some impact, but overall, we don’t expect any of that to have a huge impact at this point.
Adam Uhlman: Thanks.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead with your questions.
David Manthey: Hi good morning. D. G. your plan seems to be coming together better than most believe that it would, when you look at the current quarter outperformance what do you feel were the biggest contributors to that outperformance relative to your expectations going in?
D. G. Macpherson: I would say that almost all of the outperformance came in two places. One is the U.S. and the other is Canada. So that contributed about $0.60 of the outperformance. Obviously, given the U.S. size most of it was there. I would say, a little of that outperformance would be the market strengthening and the rest would really be around price and marketing and some of our sales activities with large local customers that are really getting traction. So that’s where we could see most of the outperformance right now. And then Canada was - the rest of that and that was getting some traction on the price increase, which was a really important.
David Manthey: And just to be clear, did you say that the price increase was in the second half of the quarter or…?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, it was.
David Manthey: Okay, and then a follow-up question. Was there something about the operating outperformance that you saw that $0.50 or so in the fourth quarter that leaves you to believe it was unsustainable into 2018? The reason I ask is that, given that all that outperformance was concentrated into one quarter, it just seems like the guidance might have stepped up by more than the $0.50 assuming that outperformance would have been spread out more evenly in 2018 than it was in 2017. So, is there anything about it or are you just being cautious here as you look out to 2018 and everything that’s going on?
D. G. Macpherson: I think short-term we would expect, like I mentioned the demand environment continues to be strong. Lot of uncertainty of course to what happens throughout the year and so we built in the outperformance from the U.S. into the guidance, but we didn’t assume that all of that continues throughout the entirety.
David Manthey: Okay, thanks to D. G. Good luck.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning everyone. How are you today?
D. G. Macpherson: Great.
Robert McCarthy: Good. So, I think - two questions or two sub questions, how are you want to typify, I think the first question is building of some, what David asked about, I mean clearly perhaps your conservatism could be due to the fact that the back half of 2018 will provide a very interesting compare environment, because you will be anniversarying the price comps and the volume response, so is that really where the base is of your caution with respect to right raise in the guidance further, is really the rubber hits the road in the back half of 2018, and will have a better sense than because then you will start to anniversary some of these actions?
D. G. Macpherson: Well I think, as I mentioned before, if you look at mid-size customers for example, most mid-size customers have not yet engaged with us, so I think there is probably a longer run way than just through the end of July to grow with mid-size customers and you would expect to continue to grow there. I think if we’re being cautious, it’s just, we don't have enough time history here to know exactly how this is going to play out. So, we are - we have got our targets and we are holding to our target, and that’s what we’re going to do.
Robert McCarthy: And then on the 2019 targets, I mean, any thoughts about how you're cadence and how that’s looking there, is there any source of potential upside from those targets or do you at least think those targets remain very firm?
D. G. Macpherson: We’re still very comfortable with those targets. We don't change long-term guidance at the quarter and we will continue to talk about that certainly in November when we [indiscernible].
Robert McCarthy: The final question obviously given the stock move and the fundamental performance improvement the CFO job is looking increasingly attractive or is there any updates as to when we will see a new CFO put in place?
D. G. Macpherson: I would say the process has moved along very, very well and we are deep into that process at this point. We will let you know.
Robert McCarthy: Best wishes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just around the portfolio and the question really is, does repatriation or tax reform longer term make you take a fresh look at the portfolio, whether it’s the MonotaRO business or any other pieces of the business, just in terms of whether they belong or don't belong or whether the tax rules sort of change your view on monetization longer term?
D. G. Macpherson: So, I think the first thing I would like to say - Hamzah thanks for the question - is that we have gone through a lot of work over the last three years to get our portfolio to be where we think it needs to be, and so the business that we have that remain we think can be very successful. It’s still early in the tax reform cycle to understand whether there will be significant implications throughout the portfolio, but right now we think the portfolio we have is the right one. We think we have competitive advantage in the places where we think we can grow the businesses and grow them profitably and that’s where we’re focused on.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And just a follow-up question, if you could just remind investors on your government business and how that did and clearly the shutdown was only three days, but since it’s topical and we saw some impact in 2013 in your business, I know federal is a smaller piece, but just any view on how that government business did and what we should be thinking about?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, so I think our government business is very strong. When you think about the government, if you're talking about the government shutdown, typically certain parts of the government sales and so as the military continues to buy and it continues to buy, they are a big part of our federal government. It has some impact, but for us if there is a shutdown that’s short lived, it won't have tremendous impact. If it is long-lived, of course, all bets are off. But it's a fairly small - the part that was affected by the most recent shutdown was a pretty small portion of our portfolio.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping to get some more color on the capital allocation decisions that you’re making here with regard to the benefits of tax reform. So, to start with the spending on digital, with this in a plan before tax reform and maybe just give some color as to where and how this money will be spent?
D. G. Macpherson: Sure, thanks. So, for us as a company, the most important thing for us is to be successful and drive success over the long term. We took a look at the tax bill and took a look at where we might accelerate investment to ensure that we are successful. There is a host of things around digital. We’ve certainly developed a lot of capabilities. This is really moving things forward in the cycle, and so accelerating things that we probably would have done over a longer time horizon and we feel like now is the time to do that, and there will be no regrets for making these investments and they are important to creating competitive advantage longer term. And so, we decided to pull this forward.
Deane Dray: Is there any way you give us some examples of what type of spending in the lines of digital?
D. G. Macpherson: So, we're not going to talk about specifics today, but we have a plan. We are likely to talk about that more around the EPG timeframe.
Deane Dray: Got it. And just last question is, can you provide any specifics on what the adjustments where to - or the add backs where to adjusted gross margin?
D. G. Macpherson: What do you refer…
Deane Dray: I know you exclude restructuring, is there anything else?
D. G. Macpherson: Go ahead Ron.
Ron Jadin: Most of it is op expense. The ones that affect the cost of goods sold or GP would be the ones that have do with inventory primarily. So, as we go to close a branch we will increase reserve because some of the inventory that we would have sold over time now, we have to accelerate that process. So, we end up taking a hit to cost of goods sold as we increase that provision. That’s predominantly what it would be. So, most of it is in expense out of that 112 million we talked about, we could do the math on that, but it’s - I think it’s 10 million, 15 million that would COGS.
Deane Dray: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Duncan with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Matt Duncan: Hi good morning guys congrats on a great quarter.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Matt Duncan: So, first question I have got, D. G. I was hoping maybe you could give us just a little bit more granularity on the external ratio and volume you saw with U.S. large customers, you did mention that the spot buy volume and the non-contracted large customer volume both grew faster than the average, could you put some numbers on that by chance and sort of help us gauge what the acceleration was from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in those two categories?
D. G. Macpherson: I think the important point there, Matt is that, those two pieces of volume had been shrinking for several years. And now they’re actually contributing to the growth and so both were - they were slightly better than the average, but that really jumped sequentially from what we have been seeing with both large local and spot buy. So, we saw, I think spot buy grow roughly 10, and large local grow roughly close to 10, little less than 10. So those were the numbers we saw.
Matt Duncan: Okay that’s very helpful, thank you. And then another one on gross margin, sorry to keep beating you over the ahead with this, but just on the supplier price increases that you are seeing, what are those sort of on average and then historically one thing that I’ve thought you guys have always done well over time is use inflation to help get a little bit of gross margin? Although this seems like a strange conversation to have right now, is there any chance that you might benefit a little bit as you sort of time how you increase your pricing around inflation or is that just not the way we need to be thinking about it, given the dynamics in your business right now?
D. G. Macpherson: No, I think it is the way to think about it. I think net, net of the repricing, we do believe that we will be able to benefit from inflation. To your question about what we’re seeing from suppliers it’s all over the map depending on what type of supplier they are, but, you know low single-digit inflation is kind of what we are seeing at this point on average. And so, we would expect to benefit some from that.
Matt Duncan: Okay, thanks D. G.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with MRC. Please go ahead with your question.
Sam Darkatsh: From Raymond James hopefully. So, hi D. G., good morning. So, two questions if I could, your original guidance for pricing in North America, I’m sorry in the U.S. was down 6% for both 3Q and 4Q and they ended up being down 5 in both quarters, was that due to a change in the pricing strategy or FX or was that you being conservative, or what was the reason for the delta between your actual pricing in U.S. and what you originally guided for?
D. G. Macpherson: It’s pretty much all customer mix or type of buy mix. So, when spot buy and large local and mid-size grow as fast as they have then that is the benefit.
Sam Darkatsh: Got you. And then second question, I mean you still have 250 million in debt pay down anticipated for 2018, I’m trying to understand why that is preferable over share repurchase, given the fact that your debt-to-EBITDA is still away about a turn or so, why is that an attractive use or use of cash?
Ron Jadin: Hi, Sam it’s Ron. You know, I have to apologize that’s a short-term debt and other, and by the end of next year it is really other. Our short-term debt at the end of this year is less than $50 million. I think it’s about $40 million, and by the end of next year it’s, a similar very small number. So really that 250 million, probably 200 million of it is cash, it’s excess cash. So that could be applied to many things. In November, I mentioned that that number was about 100. So that number is growing in part because of improved performance and tax change. So, we’re reinvesting 40 million of that in CapEx as D. G. said and 80 million in share repurchase and there is more of that we could do with the excess cash that’s still there assuming we deliver on that plan.
Sam Darkatsh: Thank you, gentlemen appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions.
Robert Barry: Hi guys good morning, and I’ll add my congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to follow-up on the comments about benefiting from inflation, do you think you actually be pricing ahead of seeing it or is that a comment more due to like timing of inventory turns or something like that?
D. G. Macpherson: So, historically we’ve seen benefits from our ability to manage COGS better than inflation that we have seen, and so I think that’s probably the source of the benefit that we typically have had historically.
Robert Barry: That you think will occur again?
Ron Jadin: Well, in fact I just want to add, D. G. mentioned before low single digit inflation, on the items we are seeing inflation, but our plan for this year is still negative half a percent deflation given all the actions we take and continue to take to reduce cost with other suppliers where we're not seeing inflation.
D. G. Macpherson: I think the principle we always have as we price the market and then we get the best COGS and service we can. And so, if the market is increasing price and we’re able to manage COGS better that’s the benefit that we have seen historically that people refer to.
Robert Barry: Got it. And then you said the strong performance on the topline was mostly on your actions, the price cuts, the marketing, but anything you would call out in terms of end-markets did get notably better and may be in that commentator you could speak specifically about resellers just because it’s especially strong? Thank you.
D. G. Macpherson: I think the strength is across the board, and I think you are always looking at sort of what’s happened in the past, I think heavy manufacturing was strong. You know resellers were strong, it’s still a pretty small portion of our overall mix though. So, I wouldn't really point to anything that unusual was in the end-markets.
Robert Barry: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli. Please go ahead with your question.
Justin Bergner: Good morning D. G. and congratulations on the good quarter as well. First question just relates to understanding sort of the break-out between - among the $0.50 that sort of better than expected earnings that Grainger delivered in the fourth quarter, I’m just trying to sort of decompose that a bit, I mean it seems like about half of that is coming from the better sales growth, maybe some from mix, some from Canada, are those sort of the right buckets in the right general proportions and are there other drivers in that $0.50 be it versus your own expectations that you guys should be thinking about?
D. G. Macpherson: The bulk of that comes from the U.S. it is volume and expense leverage, so strong drop through rates on the volume and it’s Canada. The Canada GP improvement. Those are the primary levers.
Justin Bergner: And then was mix also beneficial, given the medium customers are accelerating?
D. G. Macpherson: Mix is beneficial on the gross profit line for sure. Yes.
Justin Bergner: Okay. Another question I had is, as you think about the acceleration or large customers and medium customers and higher share wallet from your pricing changes, do you have a sense as to who your increasingly taking share from, is it sort of mom and pops and regionals or is it larger national players that you think are the share donors?
D. G. Macpherson: I think, historically and I think it’s probably no different today. We’re still on a very, very fragmented market, and so when we’re gaining share typically it’s from a very fragmented set, whether it’s mom and pops or mid-size distributors or others. Mid-size customers, I think it’s even probably more diverse in the sense that there is, they use retail sometimes and so if we’re able to get that business than we might be taking it from other sources, but it’s very fragmented.
Justin Bergner: Okay great, and then just finally quick clarification question, so between the P&L investments in digital and increased CapEx which seems mainly digital related as well, you’re spending sort of an additional $50 million to $60 million on digital on 2018 versus where you are expect it to be before?
D. G. Macpherson: No, just the 40 that we're talking about.
Justin Bergner: Okay. So, the P&L impact of the increased investment is non-digital or…?
D. G. Macpherson: So, the 40 is capital, probably more like 15 of expense and the depreciation on the 40 is - gets you to the 20 million impacts.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions.
John Inch: Thank you. Morning everyone. Hi D. G. and Ron, the gross margins were better in the fourth quarter and I was wondering if there was perhaps some more favorable benefit from say the rebates, and the reason I ask that is, the question is because it is the fourth quarter does it cause for some sort of a true-up for the year? So, if you’re getting more rebates, do you have to actually recognize disproportionately more gross margin benefit because you have to average it over the course of the year, if that makes sense?
D. G. Macpherson: No, it’s a great question and certainly with the additional volume we would be getting additional rebates, but that volume is brought into inventory, so those rebates are capitalized. We would see those rebates shortly in the P&L next year.
John Inch: Okay. So, there is no - in other words the gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter was all volume metric, there wasn't any other, some sort of accrual accounting impact that would not repeat?
D. G. Macpherson: No.
John Inch: Okay. Pricing was better or sort of down five versus down six, why was that again, was it just mix, I mean you’ve answered a couple of questions saying it’s mix, but was there some other phenomenon in the way the quarter played out?
D. G. Macpherson: Just customer mix, and volume mix.
John Inch: Okay. One more question from me, it looks like the trajectory or transportation cost UPS, freight and the like that seems to be sort of having significantly higher in the short term. How do you, just describe Grainger, like how do you actually pass through those costs to customers. I know that you sort of build UPS on top, but - maybe if you could just explain sort of what’s going to be the impact of these costs and how you manage them?
D. G. Macpherson: I think we’re actually doing quite a good job of managing our transportation cost and I won't go into details of where we expect those to go now. In general, to your question, it just depends on the customer. For many customer, we actually take the burden of transportation cost and it’s included in their contract. Some do pay freight. We feel that’s the best environment because we feel we could manage those costs, as well or better than anyone and that’s what we’re focused on there.
John Inch: Just one last thing, government, I mean you basically said D. G. the government is pretty strong or was pretty strong, MSC called out weak government in December, it sounds like you did not [indiscernible] what their excuse was, but it sounds like you [indiscernible].
D. G. Macpherson: I think some of that question goes to what we saw over November and December. For us the demand environment has been very, very consistent. 2016 was a little unusual on the sense that November I think was bad for everybody and December was good for everybody, so the compares can make you think that December wasn't as good well in fact, relative to our forecast and expectations, December was every bit of strong, if not stronger than November. And so, we didn’t see anything from shutdown that caused any problems for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of indiscernible with Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.
Patrick Baumann: Hi guys, good morning. Quick question on the segment margins for the U.S. Exiting the year to you guys were at 15%, I don't think you have changed the 2018 guide for U.S. segment margin, I think it’s still 14.7% I guess at the midpoint. It’s just another question trying to get at the conservatism or the guidance and why you’re just following through the 4Q [ph] be through 2018 ops guide? So, just looking historically, the first quarter margin typically improves versus the fourth quarter. In the U.S. segment, can you remind me why that is and is there any reason this year would be different from previous years?
D. G. Macpherson: No. I mean. So, I'm just trying to understand your question. So, you are asking a historical or were the first quarter margins typically higher? [indiscernible]
Patrick Baumann: What is that?
D. G. Macpherson: That’s related to price increase cycles typically. So, often we take - we have taken price increases early in the year, and so that has typically been the pattern that we have seen. This year, we - the patent will be similar since we are taking to price increases drops offset, which is price reset that we are going through.
Patrick Baumann: Got it, got it. Makes sense. And also, where is the digital investment, is that in other businesses, will that show up there?
D. G. Macpherson: No that is in the U.S. We’re putting in the U.S.
Patrick Baumann: Okay, got it. And then, last question for me, just the volume pickup for mid-size and large spot noncontract that you saw through the quarter, I mean versus what you said at the mid-November investor meeting, it seems like, I guess you had it grown 6% for large, and 15 to 20 I think for mid-size and it was 8 for large and 26 for mid-size, was that just being conservative at the November meeting, was that just you guys being conservative or what was the growth, the pickup really back half weighted in the quarter, so it just surprised you there?
D. G. Macpherson: It’s been better than our expectations and in November we had very short time horizon of working at that data. So, I think we’re starting to get a better sense for what’s going on now.
Patrick Baumann: Okay, got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hi guys, congrats on your quarter.
D. G. Macpherson: Hi, thank you.
Andrew Buscaglia: Just wanted to dig into Canada a little bit more, I mean definitely better than expected, what end markets are really driving that and I think you mentioned things are still strong just generally on a monthly basis, but it pulled back in December, is that just like comp and remind us what the comp, why that was strong last year at this time?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. So, I think for the second part question you’re asking, I think you’re asking overall. Last year there seem to be, people are talking about budget flush and such things. It seems like customers last year spent a lot of money at the end of the year, and I don't know that we know exactly why that happens, but it made November - November was not strong, December was very strong. So, from us that compare is the only reason December looks like it’s slightly slower at this point. In terms of Canada, I think the turnaround effort we’re talking about probably is independent of end market segments. It’s more - making sure that we have the right service model, the right pricing, the right cost structure. So, the improvement wasn’t because we saw great things in any specific end user segment, it was because we focused on providing good service at the lowest cost and improving our pricing.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. Got it. So, more Grainger specific. And then one other question I had was, part of your strategy I think with Gamut was learning more about the market, and then I think your plan was to roll that into Grainger.com, can you tell us where you stand with that, is that going to be part of the additional investments you plan to make?
D. G. Macpherson: So, we are developing more detailed plans as we speak. We will provide more updates later in the year, probably, as I mentioned before, probably the EPG timeframe.
Andrew Buscaglia: Alright, thanks guys.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.
Evelyn Chow: Good morning guys. This is Evelyn Chow on for Joe. I like to touch first on Canada. I understand the prudence in maintaining the guide right now for 2018, but just curious to understand, you had great price increases, your expense leverage in 4Q was very impressive, what more do you kind of need to see out of this business, either from the market or your own strategic actions to making confident that this could turn profitable in 2018?
D. G. Macpherson: I mean, I think we’ve got a plan that basically lays out what we expect to get by quarter and we’re on that plan, and we have a set of initiatives that we are executing with high intensity and if we continue to execute as we started to execute I think we’re going to be in good shape. So, we are watching things very closely if you might suggest and we’re going to make sure that we execute this well, but there is no structural reason why the Canadian business cannot be very profitable and get back to growth once we get through the reset.
Evelyn Chow: That makes sense. And then maybe just, almost a conceptual question, I think a lot of sceptics that figures look at the benefits from tax reform not just for your business, but across distributors in general, kind of points an idea that what if these tax benefits can get competed away? I guess I would infer from your increased digital investments that you believe these are benefits that are here to stay. I’d just be curious to understand your response to that kind of pushback both for the industry and for your business in particular?
D. G. Macpherson: I think over the very long term, I think we don’t know what benefits will be sticking. Right now, certainly it’s a benefit to us and we’re going to continue to invest in things that make us successful that help us compete differentiate us from our competitors, create value for our customers and that’s really our focus, so I won’t comment or speculate on what happens with the benefit of tax over the long term.
Evelyn Chow: Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Chris Belfiore with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.
Chris Belfiore: Good morning. So, I understand that Grainger is historically been able to pass inflations through at a higher rate, but the competitive environment has changed, so do you have a sense of the acceptance of a higher price with the U.S. government, customers given that they may have other options and then all the pricing actions you guys wanted to share?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes. So, as I mentioned, we tend to think of managing price as a market competitiveness effort. So, we will look very closely at what happens with market prices. Historically, we had seen inflation pass through two customers. We don’t really see any reason or anything different in the market price structure now than we did two years ago. Most of the changes, all of the changes we made have been because of our own structure, not really because market prices have been increasing or decreasing. And so, I don’t think the dynamics actually changed all that much. We don’t have any evidence that it has changed all that much and so I don’t know why we would think that it’s an inflationary environment and we manage COGS where we wouldn’t get to benefit.
Chris Belfiore: Okay. And then just going up to Canada, with regard to the volume price relationship there was there any demand weakness or was it just a function of lower volumes on the higher pricing?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, I think the lower volume is only partially because of the pricing. Lower volume is also because we removed a bunch of branches. So, we will go from 170 branches to 35 or something like that over the course of two years and that is taking away some unprofitable volume, but certainly taking away a little bit of volume.
Chris Belfiore: Thanks.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast. Please go ahead with your questions.
Ryan Cieslak: Hi, good morning guys, congrats on the quarter. My first question, D. G. you mentioned that, with regard to the mid-size customers the new customer acquisition still is early innings and maybe somewhat slow, but at this point what most of the pricing actions having been taken, what do you need to do or what you think is the trigger to really start to see some new customers come through to the model?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, just to be clear we are seeing some new customers come through, but it’s a smaller portion initially there, existing our lapse customers. So, we have a lot of experience with acquiring new customers in some of the online businesses, it just takes time. You just keep acquiring, acquiring, acquiring, and so we are not going to - the reality is the customers are not Grainger customers, you have to get to them through, usually through digital solutions and if you - if they find that the prices are competitive when they get the service that we provide they often come back and so we’re really focused on acquiring new attracted business customers and I think that'll just continue to build over time.
Ryan Cieslak: Okay and then for my follow-up question, going back to the question and the comments about passing along inflation for you guys in some of the supplier inflation that you have already seen, have you already started to pass that along and been successful, just want to be clear there, and if not when does that actually or do you start to do that, is that something you're going to wait a quarter or two to do, or is that something you guys are already starting to implement and progress through here in the first quarter? Thanks.
D. G. Macpherson: We’ve already started it very recently, but we’re able to change price multiple times during the year. We’ve already started that process. So, we will start to see some of that benefit in the first quarter.
Ryan Cieslak: Okay. Best of luck guys.
Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your questions.
Chris Dankert: Good morning guys thanks for fitting me in here. Just thinking about the digital strategy, obviously that’s doing quite well, but are you willing to comment on success of kind of your endless selection strategy versus more approaching Gamut and Grainger.com is there any kind of difference in trends that we should be thinking about?
D. G. Macpherson: I think - we will talk a lot about this in May. I think the differences might include some subtleties. I would say that the endless sort of model tends to be attracted to smaller customers, less complex customers, and the solutions that we provide on Grainger.com Gamut tend to be more attractive for, certainly more industrial customers and bigger customers or more complex customers. So, we see acquisition and growth rates that are different across the customer base, across those two solutions typically.
Chris Dankert: Got you. I will wait until the EPG I guess. And then thinking about Cromwell, getting digital getting online that was a big focus when that was brought on board, I guess any comment on how that progress is going?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, so we’ve replumbed the website for Cromwell core business and started Zoro U.K. Zoro U.K is certainly early days, but starting to get some traction. Too early to tell how fast that’s going to grow, but we'll certainly start to see some growth in U.K. The market seems to be there for that offer, so we're pretty excited about what we're seeing early.
Chris Dankert: Got it. Thank you so much guys.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back to D. G. Macpherson for closing comments.
D. G. Macpherson: Alright. I will close very quickly here. Thank you for your time and attendance today. As I mentioned, overall, we’re very pleased with our progress. I think we’ve done a lot of heavy lifting this year to get not only pricing right, but to get our portfolio to be as clean as possible and we are really focused now on creating value for customers in U.S. turning around Canada, continuing to accelerate growth with the online model, and given all the changes, given our team members efforts this year, we feel like we’re much better position than we were certainly a year ago. So, we’re pretty optimistic about where we're heading and really [indiscernible] execution. So that’s where we're going to focus on. So, thanks for your time and thanks for following us.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will follow formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.
Laura Brown: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Grainger’s third quarter earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Ron Jadin, Senior VP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking based on our current view of future events, and actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today’s call with the corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q3 press release, which is available on our Investor Relations Web site. D. G. will be making some opening comments regarding performance of the Company with an update on our pricing actions in the U.S. After that, we will open the call for questions. D. G. to you.
D. G. Macpherson: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thanks for joining everybody. Before I begin, I wanted to acknowledge the many natural disasters that we have collectively faced in the third quarter to say that it has been an unusual period, would be a great understatement. Multiple hurricanes across Texas, the Southeast Florida, Puerto Rico and the Islands, the earthquakes in Mexico and the wildfires out west have all challenged our team members and our customers. We're relieved that all of our team members have stayed safe and we are really heartened by the support that we provided to these communities during this unusual period. Our team members have worked selflessly and diligently to help these communities. I've received countless personal notes of how our team members supported individuals and companies, and it makes me very proud to be a part of this organization with 23,000 team members. These natural disasters didn't have a material impact on our financial results this quarter, but the value that we bring to communities and customers during these times is really impressive. So let me move onto the quarter, and the quarter the message is pretty simply. Overall, it was a solid quarter and there were some positive signs. We continue to implement our pricing initiatives, which are driving solid growth as we expected. Removing pricing is a barrier in the U.S. allows us to do what we do best, which is to create value for our customers. We do that through our seller and onsite relationships, our fulfillment capabilities, our technical support and by helping customers take out cost. We continue to manage our expenses tightly and to make progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to make progress on resetting our Canadian business for profitability. Our single channel online model continues to drive solid growth and margin expansion. And we continue to invest for the future in critical areas. Most notably, with digital investments to measure that our digital capabilities are advantaged; in our supply chain, to make sure that we can handle the volume with great service; and by providing tools to help our front line team members to be more effective. And we are acting with urgency across the entire business to make sure that our business is set for profitable growth going forward. Now, before I go into details in some of these areas, I will discuss the overall Company results. We will start with our reported results on slide four, which include the impact of restructuring in the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. adjustments include restructuring primarily related to the consolidation of contact centers, partially offset by gains on sales of assets, branches and other items. Canada restructuring include the branch and headcount reductions. So this morning's call we will focus on adjusted results, which excludes the items outlined in our press release. So our adjusted results, which are on page five are in line with our expectations. Total Company sales were up 2% or 3% on a daily basis. Volume was up a strong 8%. Price was down 4% as the entire assortment went on web pricing August 1st in the U.S. Hurricane related sales growth was offset by lower seasonal sales in the quarter. Our gross profit declined 150 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to get strong operating expense leverage on higher volumes. Operating expenses increased 3%, volume up 8% in the quarter. And operating cash flow was up slightly despite the price write down as we focus our investments on the highest return areas. I’ll cover other businesses first. As a reminder, other business includes our online model and our international businesses. Sales in our other businesses were up 13%. That’s 15% excluding foreign exchange headwinds on a daily basis. The online businesses, which includes Zoro in the U.S. and the MonotaRO in Japan, continue to expand operating margins. Our international businesses performed in line with our expectations as a group. And operating margin, as of note, operating margin expanded versus the prior year excluding our investment in the digital platform. So we put our digital investments in the other business category. And if you excluded those, operating margins would have been 6.1% in the quarter. Let's move to Canada, and Canada sales were up 7%, which is 2% in local currency on a daily basis. Expenses in Canada were flat in local currency. And as you know, we're in the midst of a substantial transformation of the business in Canada. And we’ll discuss our plans in Canada and detail in a few weeks at our November Analyst Meeting. Turning to the U.S. We had encouraging results and trends from the volume response to pricing actions, and an improved demand environment. Sales for the quarter were up 1% on a daily basis. That included volume of 7% and price deflation of 5%. As a side note, this volume growth puts us in the 6% to 8% range that we’ve talked about for annual growth, volume growth in 2018 and 2019. We had a strong fiscal year end from the Federal government after several months of delayed spending. Hurricane related sales added 1% to sales as in inter-company in the U.S. They were completely offset by holiday timing and seasonal sales, so the 7% is really true volume in the quarter. Now, the growth was somewhat aided by demand tailwinds. Our current analysis suggests U.S. market will grow 2% to 3% for the year. Operating expenses in the U.S. were flat, demonstrating leverage on volume growth. We continue to be diligent in managing expenses, and are confident that we’re going to achieve the cost targets that we’ve outlined previously. Operating margin declined 220 basis points, driven by the GP impact of our pricing actions. So, taking a little closer look at large customers in the U. S. We continue to see sequential volume improvement with large customers. A note here of hurricanes effect large and mid size customers differently; hurricane related sales growth was more than offset by lower seasonal sales and holiday timing with our large customer, so this is really a pure volume. The benefit from the August 1 pricing rollout started in August, but really accelerated in September. Technically, what happened was we turned on the web prices on August 1st. We basically make sure that everything is working correctly and then we started investing in digital investments after that point about a week later. We talked last quarter about government slowing down in the second quarter. That continued into the quarter but then we saw a pick-up in activity at the end of the quarter. U. S. had two notable growth areas large spot by volume, which have been declining for years, grew in the quarter and large non-contract volume which have been declining for years also grew in the quarter. So, those are very positive signs looking forward. Turning to mid size customers. We had significant improvement year-over-year and versus the second quarter of 2017. All of this business is now competitively priced. We are acquiring customers digitally and we’re seeing strong drop due margins to the bottom line. For the first time in the long time, we have significant growth with midsize customers at attractive margins. Now, as a reminder, the actions of August 1st resulted in all prices for all customers being more competitive. This helps us speed up customer retention efforts, accelerates the acquisition of new customers. And it simplifies our pricing to make it much easier for customers to understand. And these actions are critical to achieving our 2019 operating margin objectives. Turning to guidance. In terms of 2017 guidance, we narrowed the range. We kept the mid-point the same. Our performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We would expect that given changes we’re making in Canada, which are significant, we would expect performance for that business to be challenged versus our expectations for the remainder of the year. And we would not be surprised if the U. S. was a bit stronger than expectations, given what we’ve seen. Sales midpoint is slightly lower because we divested a specialty business in the quarter. We’ve maintained our operating margin rate and our EPS midpoint. And of note, Q4 expenses are higher sequentially due to normal timing of expenses and investments we’re making in the single channel online business and digital marketing. So in close, we had a solid quarter. The U. S. volume growth was very encouraging. Digital marketing enables us now to acquire customers. The online model grew nicely and profitability expanded. We had solid expense management throughout the company. And we continue to work to turnaround Canada. The U. S. pricing actions remove a barrier. They allow us to focus on creating value for our customers. We do that by helping take cost out of the customers’ business. We help them manage our inventory and what is a very messy category. We provide exceptional fulfillments, and our sales and service teams help businesses succeed. So this is our first and third quarter call, which comes at an interesting time, given our Analyst Day is only a few weeks away. At our Analyst Meeting, we’ll cover a number of topics in more depth, including price and volume response in the U. S., the Canada turnaround, our digital strategy and our cost actions. So with that, I’ll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ryan Merkel: The first question I have is on U.S. sales in September, up 5%. What was the U.S. volume growth, ex-hurricanes and ex-divesting the specialty business?
D. G. Macpherson: For the large customers?
Ryan Merkel: For the U.S.? I was thinking…
D. G. Macpherson: For volume, yes…
Ryan Merkel: And that's relative to 7% for the quarter…
D. G. Macpherson: It was nine.
Ryan Merkel: So that’s encouraging. And then my second question, in the fourth quarter do you expect U.S. volume growth to improve from the 7% that you did in the third quarter? Now you just did 9% in September. So I'm assuming the answer is, yes. And then also tell us what you think U.S. price will be down in the fourth quarter just to calibrate our model?
D. G. Macpherson: So I would say, Ryan that our volume expectations haven't changed. We would expect to see continued improvement, slight improvement in volume, and our GP expectations are what they were before. Sequentially, we expect our gross profits to be down 20 to 40, to 50 basis points, and that's just because we have the full effect of the pricing actions in the quarter. So that's our expectation.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Duncan from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Matt Duncan: So, on the U.S. large customer business, you went from four in the 2Q to a five in the 3Q. I'm curious is there any way to sort through how much you think you were able to get from -- it sounds like the spot by volume did start to pick back up again, and how much of the benefit did that add? And then economically, were the tailwinds a little better in 3Q versus 2Q, or was it the same environment?
D. G. Macpherson: So, we've experienced modest tailwinds that continued to increase throughout the year, I'd say. So it's little better it seems at the quarter. In terms of the large customers, both the spot buy and large non-contract customers, which effectively are all spot buy, showed some growth for the first time in a long time, and that helps. And our contract customers continue to grow similarly to what we've seen, continue to improve slightly. So that's no real change there in terms of the path that we've been on.
Matt Duncan: And then shifting over to the medium sized customer base then, a three to a 15 is obviously a very big change. It sounds like maybe five points give or take of that was hurricane related, but still three to 10 is quite nice. Did you, did you kick in the digital marketing? How much volume would you attribute to that? And are there any correlations we can draw here in terms of timeline that when we started to see this volume really pick up as we look over to the U.S. large customer business and think about the timeline of how long it takes for the price actions to help with growth there?
D. G. Macpherson: So just to be clear, so the 15% is net of the hurricane impact. So the actual growth for mid size customers is higher when you include the hurricane impact. And I would say it’s a fairly clear path in terms of continued growth post the price changes. And mid-August, we really started digital marketing in earnest and so that certainly help the growth post that period.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning, and congratulations on a better than expected quarter. I guess the first question I have is in terms of the gross margin, could you just talk about the walk in the U.S., because I think the total company was benefited by gross margin benefit in Canada in the quarter, lower inventory adjustment, something along those lines. Could you just talk about what was the pure compression in GP in the U.S.?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, in the U.S. the year-over-year compression was we're looking at 150 basis points in the U.S. and so that -- which is exactly what we expected. And sequentially, it was 180 basis points.
Robert McCarthy: 180 basis points from Q2, which was in line with your expectations, it sounds like…
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, it’s almost exact with our expectations.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. And then just a follow up on Canada. Obviously, fairly dynamic there and obviously some updates for '17. But how do we think about, and you gave us some updates around '17 in terms of Canada being worse and U.S. being a little better versus your expectations. But how do we think about going into the targets for '19 in terms of where is the incremental pressure on '19 targets now, given the run rate of what you're seeing in your businesses?
D. G. Macpherson: So we’ll talk a lot about that in the few weeks, Rob. I would say that our expectation and in terms of the actions we're taking in Canada, we expect our profitability will be better. And we’ve talked about Canada being in 2019 and so we’re taking actions now to make that happen. It’s a messy process. There is a significant change that we're making to the business. But we’ll give more clarity on that in a few weeks.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: I have two questions for you, the first is hopefully easy. You note on page nine that the spot buy and large non-contract business volume was positive in the third quarter. And I'm just wondering, are we to read that your price actions went beyond spot buy and into large non-contract?
D. G. Macpherson: So keep in mind that a large non-contract customer would almost have the same price change or similar to mid size customers that they didn’t have pricing that they’ve gotten historically. And so non-contract large customers will have more of a price write down and better volume response similar to mid size customers not quite as severe because there are some large non contract customers that have price deals historically. So you should read that that -- the price change to have a very big impact on that group we would expect.
Scott Graham: Okay, because that's a little different than your message previously, right? Or am I not understanding it?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, we lumped historically spot buying with large non-contract in some of what we shown. But there is a significant portion of the volume that’s non-contracted.
Scott Graham: I understand that now. The other question that I have for you very simply is with spot buy better and midsize customers better, did we have a positive mix in the U.S.?
D. G. Macpherson: So not quite. Although, the trends would suggest that could happen is what I would say.
Scott Graham: That should happen. Would you agree?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, it should. Once we lap the price changes it should happen for sure.
Scott Graham: I understand. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Robert Barry: Could I just clarify a couple of things you said earlier, the 15% growth in medium you said, is -- would have been higher?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes.
Robert Barry: So, the hurricane…
D. G. Macpherson: So the way that works is we have a hurricane. Our branches we typically load the branches with hurricane type products and they skew more to midsize customers. So we see more midsize customer hurricane volume than we would see with large customers. We see a lot of it everywhere of course. But so it had a bigger impact but we’ve taken that out with the 15%.
Robert Barry: So where is in the large, the hurricane was offset by the holiday timing and seasonal, it was a net benefit in the medium?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, exactly.
Robert Barry: And also to clarify, you said September in the U. S. was up nine on volume. Is that also a clean number, I would have thought the hurricane would have been mostly September or weather or maybe mostly August, that volume number…
D. G. Macpherson: It excludes it basically, yes.
Robert Barry: And then if I could just ask quick question about what’s going on with inflation. I know there are lot of puts and takes impacting the gross margin this year. But if you just look at product cost inflation, how much of a headwind is that you’re observing this year. And are you getting any price to offset it, say in the large customer contract business?
D. G. Macpherson: So, our COGS inflation this year is going to be very slightly negative. And so we are seeing inflation. Now, we are starting to see inflationary pressures a little bit more than we’ve seen in the last few years of course. But so far, we have that is not shown up in our COGS line.
Robert Barry: Why is that so minimal given what we’ve seen with commodity inflation headwinds?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, we’ve done a whole bunch of work at looking at product categories and optimizing our product categories and cost. So, we have a rigorous process where we’re following, we call it PPO, which basically helps us get the right assortment at the right cost.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Andrew Buscaglia: Can you just comment on that spot buy? You guys didn’t provide more data in the slide this time around. But can you provide us with a number relative to that negative 3% you saw in Q2?
D. G. Macpherson: It’s gone from -- it was negative three, and it’s low single-digit positive for the quarter.
Andrew Buscaglia: And would you attribute that to some of the new -- I mean, first of all, how did that do relative to your expectations? And then do you attribute some of that to new things like Gamut, I mean we had Zoro been strong or continue to be strong. But what would you say [indiscernible]?
D. G. Macpherson: The spot buy is with large contract customers and that would not have anything to do with Gamut at this point. It would be just the pricing just that we make. And making sure that we’re actually selling the value and getting more of the customers’ pie.
Andrew Buscaglia: And then if I could just squeeze one more in it, your OpEx was flat on that 7% volume number. But what can we expect in terms of -- I mean, I know that you probably talked more about this at the Analyst Day. But looking into ‘18, what that OpEx increase would be -- like what’s the framework to think about that for the long-term?
D. G. Macpherson: So we’ll talk about that at the Analyst Day. Obviously, we expect to get continued leverage and we expect expenses to grow slower than volume. But we'll talk more specifically in a few weeks.
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Just had a question about the price trend in the negotiated large customer contracts that you said are about done. I think long term that's still a percentage roll every year to a degree. So wondering your visibility conviction at price concession remains an incremental piece long term of those negotiations, or is that similarly off the table and stabilized?
Ron Jadin: We're expecting carryover impact next year on pricing probably minus 2% range, and we'd expect that to then flatten out in the following year and turn positive with inflation.
Christopher Glynn: And then just curious fourth quarter tax rate and place holder for ongoing tax rate?
Ron Jadin: So we've guided for the balance of the year for tax rate already and we'll give a guide in our November Investor Day for next year. And I know there's been a number of ranges published already this morning from some of the sell side on taxes. And it's difficult for us to comment on third quarter taxes versus consensus. But I think it's a little bit more straight forward for us to talk about it year-over-year. And when we look at our reported tax rate in the third quarter of last year, it was about 34% and this year it's 31.7%, and that's in our press release. If you look at that and how we’re weighted to last year's earnings before taxes, it's an improvement of about $6 million in lower taxes or about $0.10 EPS. And about two thirds of that is driven by our clean energy investments and the other third is driven by some solar credits and foreign tax credits. So for us year-over-year normalized it's about $0.10 pickup. And about two thirds of that also would have been -- because this is done on a year-to-date trough, two thirds of that $0.10 is probably from the first half of the year. So a lot there to consume, but that's our perspective on a year-over-year basis.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Belfiore from UBS. Please go ahead.
Chris Belfiore: So, I just trying -- kind of go back to the mix a little bit. So if possible, trying to understand the benefit that you guys might have seen from any cost actions on the market improvement in the United States versus the mix? Given some of the numbers you kind of gave with the one you just gave of low single digit improvement on spot, it kind of implies that the recurring side kind of actually decelerated from 1Q to 2Q to 3Q. So the mix does seem better. So just trying to understand that a little bit kind of understand that how you have -- you still in negotiations with the recurring sites for the large contracts. So how that might change going forward a little bit?
D. G. Macpherson: So, I think maybe I can help, just talk about. So we renegotiated most of the contracts that we would want to at this point. There’s some that we can't because of contractual reasons, and we'll get to those over the next year. The way this works, it's a little bit odd to look at spot buy independent from the total volume or non-spot buy with large customer, because the goal here is to grow the entire customer and to have more of the share beyond spot buy. So the non spot buy basically has been fairly consistent in terms of the growth in the business, but we start to see that spot buy, that means more of the mix is non-negotiated, which just makes it easier for the customer and makes it easier for us and actually is helpful for everybody. So that’s the goal and changing this at this point.
Chris Belfiore: And then I know you said that kind of give a lot of details in November. But in terms of Canada, I mean, you guys have been targeting breakeven operating margins by year end, and it seems likes that’s probably not the case. Just kind of any commentary around that or is there trends that you're seeing in the region from that from that stand point?
D. G. Macpherson: So we're seeing decent volume growth. We will come back, as I mentioned before, in about three weeks and talk through the plan for Canada. And the plan for Canada as we said it before is substantial, and I think get's us to a place that is much more profitable in 2019, which is what we’re looking for. So we will talk about that very shortly.
Operator: Next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Like to get some color, further color on the hurricane impact. Specifically, what your sense of the mix for those medium customers relative to the segment average? And then what is expectation for fourth quarter impact from hurricane?
D. G. Macpherson: Fourth quarter impact, Deane, will probably be very small, if it is noticeable. In terms of mix, most of the time we have hurricanes I think this was no different. Product mix is similar in many ways to the rest of the mix. We end up spending a little bit more money frankly to deliver the product. So we do a lot of things that you wouldn’t naturally do. And so things like freight cost go up in the short-term to serve the customer. It's not really a big net benefit or decrement to the GP rate.
Deane Dray: And just as a follow up, have you quantified what the digital investment in the quarter was? From a dollar amount, but also what is exactly we’re spending it on?
D. G. Macpherson: We have not quantified that. We’ll talk about that in a couple -- in a few weeks, that’s going to be a part of the discussion we have in the Analyst Day.
Operator: Our next is from Luke Junk from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Luke Junk: First, D. G. just wondering if you could help size the benefit from higher government spending in September, is it in the same areas, the drag that you saw in June?
D. G. Macpherson: So, I would say fiscal year end, in general, was similar to past year it wasn’t either really strong or really weak. So it was similar fiscal year end to what we've seen before. Net-net there have been some bumps in terms of government procurement that happened from mid May through mid August, probably in the negative for the year so far. But year-end it was pretty good but not unusual.
Luke Junk: And then second little bigger picture question. Just wondering as you're ramping up your efforts to acquire customers in the mid size area. I'm wondering is where and how your digital marketing activities that picked up in mid August here and inside sales efforts in your sack. So differently from a perspective range of your customer, how is that marketing effort can appear to me, and say if I do place an order, what kind of follow up or sale cycle expect to see?
D. G. Macpherson: So the basic funnel, and again we’ll talk about this in a few weeks. But we will use digital marketing in many cases to acquire customer, we learned who that customer is. We’ll figure out what the right price and service offering for that customer is. And then if they get big enough and attractive enough inside sales will cover them. And once an inside sales person is covering them most of the digital investments will be email digital as opposed to discounting digital. So there’s a funnel and a process for customers as they get more mature. That leaves them to inside sales if the characters fix with that customer make sense.
Operator: Our next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Evelyn Chow: This is Evelyn Chow on for Joe. I would like to dig into the light spot buy acceleration, great to see very encouraging sign. Just wondering if there is any tilt this quarter towards certain customer or product categories that you’ve seen?
D. G. Macpherson: No, the growth has been pretty consistent across the board. So if you look at the overall customer growth, it’s been similar in the spot buy.
Evelyn Chow: And then maybe turning to the divestiture of the U. S. specialty business, just wanted a little bit more clarification on the rationale and any potential impact to margins this year?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, it was a relatively small business that made a little bit of money. It was not core to what we do. And so some of our acquisitions we’ve integrated into the core, and this one never really made sense to integrate into the core. We brought some of the products into the business. But frankly this business ends up joining another business that’s similar and has a much better chance of success in that portfolio than it does with us.
Operator: Our next question is from Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead.
Justin Bergner: My first question is just similar to some other questions that have been asked, which is if the spot buy and non contract buy for the large customers drove the acceleration and the actual contractual buy was at a similar growth rate as last quarter. I mean, it would seem that with the market accelerating a bit holding the contract purchases similar growth rate might be under performing the improvement in the market. Is that true and if so why?
D. G. Macpherson: No, we actually don’t think that’s true. And if you look at the large customer results, what you’ll see is the spot buy and the non-contract customers went from negative to growing low single-digits which means the rest of it had to grow faster than the average. And so that is -- and we think that’s gaining share at a similar pace to what gain share before.
Justin Bergner: Okay, that’s great to know. And then on the acceleration in the other businesses, I guess the volume accelerated from second quarter a touch, but the single channel number decelerated fairly materially. So what’s offsetting the deceleration in the single channel business to hold the other business volume consistent with prior quarter growth?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, we’ve seen nice growth with the single channel online model even through this quarter the Japanese business grew in the 20s. But there are other businesses, Mexico grew strongly favorably strongly. So, we’re seeing growth in some of the other international but the UK grew a little bit. So we’re seeing nice growth in that portfolio as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead.
Hamzah Mazari: The first question is just on market share. D. G. large customer market share for you guys, and correct me if I’m wrong, is maybe 14%. Can you get to double-digit market share on the medium customer side? Or is there anything structural that prevents that? And then secondly, are you maxed out on large customer market share but that’s a pretty big number when you look at the overall industry?
D. G. Macpherson: I think we’re not maxed out on large customer market share. I think we have share opportunities to grow. When I do customer visits there, frequent discussions about how to expand the relationship find more context sell our value in the places where we don't have value -- add value today. So I'm not concerned that we've tapped out. Midsize customers, I guess, when you're as low shares where we'll see. When you talk to the midsize customers, they really love Grainger and the value that Grainger provides and they just haven't been buying from us largely because of price and we haven't actually been reaching out to them. So we'll see. I'm going to reserve that answer for time back. I think there's a long playfield for us to grow midsize customers.
Hamzah Mazari: And then just a follow-up. Any comments around the CFO search and what you're looking at there, I appreciate it?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, so we have a search firm and a number of candidates that are -- that we are working through and we will get you an update when we have the CFO. We have very good pipeline.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Baumann from J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Patrick Baumann: I had a quick question on the pricing. You had a couple of months now under your belt with the new cuts, or price reductions. Are you seeing any noticeable competitive response on pricing and if so from where?
D. G. Macpherson: So, maybe I should start by what we've done with pricing, I think it was probably more unique to us than to the market where our prices were out of market the way we go to market. And so we expected modest reaction and that's pretty much what we've seen. There hasn't been much reaction. The reality in our space is that everybody goes to market differently, has their own strategy. And so we haven’t seen a lot of direct response to our actions, and our prices aren't lowest now and won't be.
Patrick Baumann: And then just a clean-up question on tax rate, and I know you talked about the year-over-year change. But how much or did tax rate at all add to the midpoint of your EPS guidance relative to your prior guidance, and if so how much?
Ron Jadin: No. This is Ron. We stayed with the midpoint. We think the benefit overall on taxes is in the $0.05 to $0.10 range, and it’s really offsetting some little bit of loss earnings from the specialty business we sold very small and then just a cautious look at Canada for the year.
Patrick Baumann: And then last one from me, just one more clean-up. The revenue guidance, the tightening around the low end and it seem like. Is that all because of...
Ron Jadin: That's because of the specialty business sale. I think that was your question so yes, specialty business sales.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steve Barger: Just back to the comment on working to get the right assortment at the right cost to offset inflation. Does that mean you're de-sourcing or resourcing some product to different vendors or how does that work?
D. G. Macpherson: Well, it typically is at a category level. And by category level, I would mean 500 SKUs, 200 SKUs. And effectively, we look at all the customer feedback and what customers care back. We look at the assortment we have and in some cases we're adding vendors, in some cases we consolidated vendors. It just depends on what the customers care about and then we try to get the lowest cost we can. And so there's not a single formula. You have to do it category-by-category.
Steve Barger: And do you expect you can keep the lid on that inflation as you go through the end of this year into the first part of '18 based on your efforts?
D. G. Macpherson: Yes, we do. We think we'll keep a lid on inflation. I think if we didn't have that program, we would be seeing some inflation for sure. But that program helps us to offset that inflation.
Steve Barger: And one more quick one sorry if I missed this. Are there any of those non-core business divestitures we should be looking for or is that portfolio where you want it now?
D. G. Macpherson: Portfolio is pretty much where we wanted now.
Operator: Our next question is from Jane Zhao from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Jane Zhao: So first one, I just want to understand little bit better the revenue and income for the specialty business, you guys divested. It was a one point headwind this quarter. But I think you guys sold the business in late July. So can you just give us some color, may be the potential impacting to 4Q?
Ron Jadin: We sold it in mid July and it was…
D. G. Macpherson: Revenue was in the $6 million to $7 million a month range, maybe…
Ron Jadin: So $70 million to $80 million businesses.
Jane Zhao: And is it slightly lower margin business compared to the rest of U.S.?
Ron Jadin: Yes.
Jane Zhao: And then on the pricing outlook. So pricing was down 5 points and it was I guess a full quarter of pricing impact. Are you guys still looking for like about 6 point of run rate in terms of price decline?
D. G. Macpherson: So keep in mind that the price changes happened mid quarter. For the last two months, the price changes were in effect. And so it's not a full, five is not a full quarter ex-U.S.
Jane Zhao: So six is still the number you guys are looking for on a run rate basis?
D. G. Macpherson: Five to six in the first quarter, five to six…
Operator: Our next question is from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
John Inch: Just to circle back the tax issue, I don’t think we got the answer. What -- Ron or D. G., what is the effective tax rate you're guiding to in the fourth quarter to get to your implied 2013 midpoint EPS?
D. G. Macpherson: For the full year, it's 34.5 to 35.5 and for the quarter, it’s about 35 for the fourth quarter.
John Inch: 35 for the fourth quarter, okay…
D. G. Macpherson: Sorry, if I wasn’t clear enough on the other comment.
John Inch: That’s okay, now I got the year. I just -- it's hard to triangulate because you’re excluding the 11 million, it’s just hard to triangulate. I was going to ask you, hurricanes were a percent of contribution in the quarter. What does that imply? Doesn’t that imply there were 3 points of contribution benefit in September? You're giving your numbers ex-hurricane. So I'm just trying to understand that.
D. G. Macpherson: John, I don’t understand the question. I didn’t track that.
John Inch: So if hurricanes were a percent of benefit for the quarter, the impact of hurricane for your commentary happened in September. Does that imply the actual September results were boosted by about 3 points, just literally taking the one versus one month?
D. G. Macpherson: So it’s two in September.
John Inch: And you said margins are slightly worse for these tails, is that correct?
D. G. Macpherson: Generally, it's not a major impact on the next I would say.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Robert McCarthy: Just a quick follow up. As you think about the medium size business, going forward, how do we think about the pricing actions you’ve taken or contemplating? And the gross margin mix as we go into '18, what’s the embedded assumption there, given what we have new information now?
D. G. Macpherson: So we're going to have to wait three weeks for that one, Rob. We’ll talk at the Analyst Day about that.
Robert McCarthy: And then just finally on Canada. Is there anything you can say about breakeven or not, or we would expect a small loss in the fourth quarter, seems these guys would imply loss given your comments around the narrowing in the range?
D. G. Macpherson: That would be our expectation and we’ll get a lot more detail in Analyst Day.
Operator: Our next question is from Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead.
Justin Bergner: Thanks for the quick follow up. On the corporate expenses, I guess, say we’re meaningfully down year-on-year and modestly down quarter-on-quarter. What’s -- is there any change to the view for the annual corporate expenses embedded in your narrowed guidance range?
Ron Jadin: And this is Ron. Not really we’ve some favorability in the third quarter driven by the low share price and stock compensation. The expensing of that and that will pride bounce back with a bit higher stock price in the fourth quarter. So there is some timing there. But that drive sequential variation. But for the year, we don’t expect anything unusual.
D. G. Macpherson: And we continue to work very hard to make sure that our costs are necessary. And so we’re really focused on making sure that our expenses are all well managed. And I think that this reflects that part.
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Cieslak: Really quick just on the volume guidance in the back half of the year in the U. S., originally 6 to 8. Have you changed that guidance at this point based on what you saw here in the third quarter or your expectations, sorry if I miss that. I just wanted to make sure that was clear.
D. G. Macpherson: So, I would say in the U. S. we’re optimistic about what we’re seeing, but we’re not fairly short timeframe. So we’re not going to change our guidance per se that we are happy with what we’ve seen.
Ryan Cieslak: And then thinking about the longer-term operating margin targets you guys have out there for 12% to 13% by 2019. Can you just refresh us on what you guys are assuming for annual COGS inflation to get to that ’19 framework? Thanks.
D. G. Macpherson: So, we don’t typically view that. I would say, we don’t actually plan annual COGS inflation necessarily in that math. We look at price cost spread. So from our question is, when we manage COGS as well or better than our competitors and we will be able to perhaps pass through whatever the market COGS is overtime. So, we typically find our financials that way as opposed to sticking with the specific number, because that number can fluctuate pretty quickly. But we’ll talk about our expectations again in few weeks.
Ryan Cieslak: Okay, thanks.
D. G. Macpherson: All right. Well, thanks everybody. I think that’s our last caller. Just to summarize, we made a solid quarter, U. S. volume growth was encouraging, continued strong growth and profitability expansion in the online model, continue to really focus on cost management and we’re in the midst of a significant turnaround in Canada. Look forward to seeing most of you in a few weeks. And thanks for your time.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger’s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Brown, you may begin.
Laura Brown: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Grainger’s Q2 quarterly earnings call. [Technical Difficulty] Good morning. This is Laura Brown and welcome to Grainger’s Q2 quarterly earnings call. With me are DG Macpherson, CEO; and Ron Jadin, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking, based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today’s call with the corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 press release, which are available on our Investor Relations website. DG will begin by making some opening comments regarding the performance of the company with an update on our pricing actions in the U.S. and expense management. After that, we will open the call for questions. DG to you.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Laura. So this quarter was about staying focused on creating value for customers, while executing our pricing initiatives in the U.S. and improving the economics of the portfolio. Before I go into detail on these activities, I’ll discuss overall company results. We’ll start with our reported results on page – on Slide 4, which were significantly impacted by restructuring. We began winding down the Columbia business in the quarter, which resulted in restructuring charges of $42 million. This business has struggled with sustaining profitability and we are moving quickly to ensure we have businesses with competitive advantage and strong returns in the portfolio. In the quarter, we also took steps to transform our Canadian business. We announced the closure of 59 branches and eliminated poorly performing assets, resulting in $20 million in restructuring for the quarter. I’ll discuss Canada in more detail in a few minutes. This morning’s call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude items outlined on page two of our press release. So turning to our adjusted results, our adjusted results were in line with expectations. Total company sales were up 2%. Volume for the company was up a healthy 7%, as many end market strengthened and our pricing actions started to take hold. Price was down 3% as expected and consistent with the first quarter. Gross profit declined 110 basis points in line with expectations that we had discussed in April. And we continue to get operating expense leverage on higher volume as operating expense as a percentage of cost was 50 basis points better than last year. Let me start with our other businesses. For our other businesses, which include our online model and our international businesses, sales were up a 11%. That included a 3% headwind from currency largely due to the British pound. The online businesses, which include Zoro in the U.S. and MonotaRO in Japan continued to deliver strong sales growth of 23% and expanded operating margins 50 basis points in the quarter. The other businesses operating margin decline was largely driven by lower than expected performance in the UK, due to economic conditions and the devaluation of the pound related to Brexit. We also completed the supply chain initiatives in Cromwell, which enable us to improve service and the cost structure of that business going forward. But those changes impacted H1 results in Cromwell. Mexico, Fabory and China make up the bulk of the rest of the international portfolio and all of those showed nice growth during the quarter. In Canada, we saw sales declined 3%, but sales were up 2% in local currency. We see trends improving in Canada and we continue to manage expenses resulting in improved performance and a smaller loss than last year. As I previously mentioned, we are closing 59 of 144 branches in Canada. To be clear, we are in the midst of a substantial transformation in the business. This business has scale and should be quite profitable. We’re still on track to exit 2017 in a break-even run rate. We will discuss our longer-term aspirations for the business as we move through the balance of the year. Turning to the U.S., the U.S. business performance in the quarter was heavily influenced by our pricing actions. Sales were up 1 for 7, 1%, which is driven by – which was a result of strong volume growth of 5% and price deflation of 4%. For those of you who look at the EPG documents, you’ll notice that for large customers, our volume went down slightly, that was all driven by government performance, which slowed in June and affected our results. The slowdown was really driven by government spending delayed in local and state budgets and in federal civilian funding. Other than that, we saw continued good trends in terms of volume. Operating expenses in the U.S. were up 2%, again demonstrating leverage and volume growth of 5%. Operating margin declined 160 basis points, driven by the gross profit impact of our pricing actions. Other operating metrics around service, competitive position continue to be strong in the U.S.. The U.S. team is focused on executing the price changes and selling the value that we provide to customers through our onsite services, advantage fulfillments and focus on saving customers time and money. So I want to take a little closer look at the volume response to our pricing actions in the quarter. I would point out a few things. First, we are seeing positive signs, where we want to see positive signs, most notably reversing trends with midsize customer volume and large customer spot buy volume. This is critical to moving from an unfavorable customer mix to a favorable mix over time. Second, we are hearing very positive comments or more customer groups about the changes we are making. Customers recognize that we still have a premium price, with that we will be more competitive. That makes sense to customers given the value that we provide. Finally, these results are up, small volumes in some cases, but our margin of volumes give us a lot of confidence in the path we’re on. We continue to get more comfortable with the fact that these changes are working. Our midsized customer volume continue to excel – accelerate throughout the quarter. Now about 50% of our midsized customer volume is on a more competitive pricing, and the midsized customer volume was positive for the quarter for the first time in more than five years. With larger customers, we see more volume coming through without discounts. These prices are lower than before the changes, but this volume is important to support the profitability of the business going forward. We are continuing to renegotiate our large customer contracts and we are ready to go for August 1. The vast majority of the contracts will be renegotiated by August 1, and the remainder will fall in normal renewal cycles. As a reminder, the actions on August 1 result in all prices for all customers being more competitive. This will speed up customer retention efforts, accelerate the acquisition of new customers as we accelerate marketing spend and simplify our pricing to make it much easier for customers to understand. These actions are critical to achieving our 2019 operating margin objectives. Turning to expenses as a key component to achieving our 2019 goals is expense management. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we announced that we would take out $100 million to $125 million of costs by 2019, $80 million to $95 million of that net of marking – marketing investment will come out of the U.S. business and in corporate.
75%: Taking a closer look at the U.S. from 2017 to 2019, we’re assuming annual volume growth of 6% to 8%, resulting in incremental volume variable expense of approximately $60 million to $90 million. We’re expecting inflationary expenses of approximately $80 million to $90 million – $80 million to $85 million, which is about 2% of the base annually, and that’s going to be partially offset by cost takeout of $80 million to $95 million net of the marketing investment. These actions result in significant operating expense leverage as we continue to focus on improving the customer experience and driving productivity and profitable growth. Given what we’ve seen so far with the pricing actions and the impact in gross profit, these expense reductions result in operating earnings aligned with the 2019 objectives we discussed last November and in April. Turning to guidance. We’re reiterating our 2017 adjusted guidance issued in April. Q2 performance was as expected and we anticipate continued positive response to our pricing actions in the second-half of the year. Looking at our 2019 targets, our long-term operating margin guidance remains unchanged from our November 2016 Analyst Meeting. In the U.S., we’re confident in our ability to gain share profitably. We provide exceptional service to our customers. With our pricing actions and marketing activities, we will gain share at a faster pace. And we will continue to take cost out of the business, while improving the customer experience. In Canada, we’re on track to exit 2017 at a break-even run rate. Our long-term guidance for Canada 2% to 4% is not good enough, we know that. We’re working towards returning to double-digit operating margin on a faster path. In other businesses, we continue to be encouraged by the growth and profit improvement of our online businesses and our international portfolio. So before we take questions, in closing, we performed as expected in the quarter. We’re seeing growth from the pricing actions in the places that will help us grow profitably in the future, most notably midsized customers and large customers spot buy. We’re focused on simplifying our portfolio and making sure we have profitable growth as evidenced by the wind-down of our Colombian business. Our actions in Canada are intended to speed the path of double-digit profitability for the business and we will provide frequent updates for you along the way. And we continue to believe that we’re well positioned to improve the customer experience with more relevant pricing, superior service and an unmatched digital experience. Today, we also announced that Ron is retiring at the end of the year. He will stick around to close out the financials for 2017 and we have started to search for his replacement. I want to thank Ron for his many contributions to Grainger in the past 20 years. We greatly appreciate all that he has done for Grainger. Thanks, Ron.
Ronald Jadin: Thanks, D.G.
D.G. Macpherson: So now we’ll open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David Manthey: Thank you. Good morning.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
David Manthey: First off, have you been able to isolate the outgrowth from pricing effort versus the growth that would be driven by an improving market? And whether that’s looking at your growth versus comps or some other benchmark. How do you know that the growth you’re seeing right now was due to the pricing actions and not just the backdrop getting better?
D.G. Macpherson: It’s a great question, thanks. Let me just start by saying that, we think the market has grown this year and we have seen strengthening in many segments. And so part of the growth is certainly – part of the volume growth is certainly driven by strengthening in the market – of the marketplace. When we look at the pricing actions, we see growth that is significantly higher than we see in the past in areas that are directly affected by pricing and that’s what gets us comfortable, particularly midsized customers, where we were double-digit negative last year and that were positive. Large local customers that are not on contracts, which have turned positive and have been negative for a long time, and then just the spot buy with manufacturing commercial customers, which have turned positive as well. And so we see very strong growth in those areas and that gives us confidence that what we’re doing is working. And we – we’ve estimated the market to be growing a couple of percent this year with volume of 5% in the U.S. Certainly, we feel like we’re gaining volume share and most of that is probably reaction to our pricing at this point.
David Manthey: Okay. And then the follow-up would be, as it relates to the progression, does the lack of momentum into June concern you at all given the backdrop in sort of what the competitors have been reporting? And I know you mentioned government, but anything else we should know about there?
D.G. Macpherson: No. That – it’s really all government. In fact, government’s 100% of the slowdown. We saw state and local government holding funds. We saw federal government holding funds in many cases. There are rumors that that is easing up, but we’ll have to wait and see if that plays out, so it has been all government during the quarter.
David Manthey: All right. Thanks, D.G. Ron, congratulations.
Ronald Jadin: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Merkel: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Ronald Jadin: Good morning.
Ryan Merkel: So my first question is, have you seen margins come under pressure for the who cares items like lights and batteries and cleaning supplies? And I asked this, because investors are concerned, as you know, that you’re going to see margin pressure on these items. And I just wonder if there’s any evidence of it yet?
D.G. Macpherson: No. I guess, the short answer to that, Ryan, is not really. I mean, I think the industry is seeing pressure on margins across the Board the last few years. And certainly product and price transparency has increased as more customers Google items actually with two customers yesterday we were talking about our price changes. And their response was that’s fantastic, because we don’t feel like we should be negotiating every item with you. And if you’re in the ballpark, you’re going to get the business, given the service that you provide. And so really we’re seeing very strong response at very strong margins, where we’re getting the new price programs in place. So there hasn’t been a real change in the competitive environment necessarily on those items where we’re competitive.
Ryan Merkel: Okay. And then for my follow-up question just on gross margin and pricing for the third quarter just to calibrate everyone. How much will U.S. prices be down in the third quarter? I was thinking down 5%, but I wanted to check. And then sequentially, maybe just help us, how much will gross margins be down sequentially into the third quarter?
D.G. Macpherson: So let me handle pricing first and then I’ll go and turn it over to Ron to handle gross profit. So we would expect July to be similar to what we’ve seen thus far this year, because there’s no change in July. For the rest of the year, we would expect to be price down – price to be down roughly 6, so we would expect kind of 5 to 6 in the quarter. And you asked GP as well, Ryan, is that right?
Ryan Merkel: Yes, just sequentially just help us, I assume I would be down, I just was thinking just trying to help calibrate is how much?
Ronald Jadin: Yes, I would say somewhere in the 100 basis points probably range, 100 to 130, sequentially.
Ryan Merkel: Okay great. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.
Adam Uhlman: Hi, good morning. I was wondering, could you spend a little bit more time about what you’re hearing in your large customer price negotiations that you’ve gone through the spot buy? Sales declines have gotten smaller, but they’re still down year-over-year. So maybe you could just give us a little bit more color about how those are going? How many contracts we retaining versus losing, that would be helpful? Thanks.
Ronald Jadin: We – so we really haven’t lost any contracts that are meaningful to the negotiations. The negotiations have gone exceptionally well. I would say that, we still have to update a very small portion of those contracts on the new pricing, because most of that debt slips in the next month. So what you’re seeing was spot buy is encouraging, but it’s also relatively small base. Still we would expect to see better results as time goes on. So but so far we haven’t had. The conversations have gone well. Customers understand what’s going on in the marketplace. They really value the service that we provide – the services we provide in many cases. And so the conversations have gone very, very well and we’re going to create more value for customers and ourselves through these process.
Adam Uhlman: Okay gotcha. And then could you talk to the branch closings in Canada? How should we think about the revenue impact from that here in the near-term?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, so there will – so there will be some revenue impact obviously in the closed branches. Typically, we see revenue impact in the 20% roughly range, many of these branches. So to give you a sense, in the U.S. we have 250 branches. In Canada, we have 144 and the volumes attempt. So we’re over store in Canada right now until we are closing branches that are unprofitable, there’ll be some revenue impact, but it’s going to be positive OE impact. And we’ve taken a very closer look at where we want branches to be and where there’s foot traffic, where we can use those branches offer service to customers that they will stay open. And we will continue to provide actually better service to customers as products ships directly to customers, and we still provide services to customers twice the business. So some revenue lost certainly. We are really focused on getting the business reset to a place where it can grow profitably, that’s our focus right now.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone. So first question just in terms of these trends you’ve been seeing, how do you think about just modeling for competitive response? I mean, obviously a lot of times, you’re dealing with a local where you’re losing out to a local mom and pop, or a local competitor on pricing and obviously lowering your price is going to help your volume. But how do you think about an environment maybe it’s obviously not across the Board.
D.G. Macpherson: Bob?
Robert McCarthy: Yes.
D.G. Macpherson: Bob, we are having trouble. We are having trouble here, sorry. I’m not sure why.
Robert McCarthy: Okay, can you hear me now?
Ronald Jadin: You’re just breaking up.
D.G. Macpherson: You’re just breaking up, I’m not sure. But okay, let’s try, try again, I’m sorry.
Robert McCarthy: Can you hear me now?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes.
Robert McCarthy: Yes. Okay, sorry about that. So the question very simply is, how do you take into account competitive response in terms of your modeling in the back half of 2017?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. And so I think the question is, how do you take competitive response to the model. I would say, we’re in an industry in the U.S. where the markets roughly $125 billion and competitors compete in very, very different ways. I was at a customer in Milwaukee yesterday and we were there, a lot of our competitors were there, serving different volume in different ways. And we have not seen direct response to the changes yet. It’s not obvious, given that some compete specialists, some compete online, some don’t compete online, it’s not obvious that how competitors will respond. And we feel like we get within range of the prices that we’re going to be very strong in terms of our growth. For the mom and pops, it’s not obvious that there’s a lot of room to respond really in terms of profit margins as well. So we’ll watch that closely. We’re watching it closely, and we will see what happens, but we haven’t seen much response yet.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. And then Ron, congratulations on your career at Grainger. I guess the question I have in terms of launching for a new CFO search, it sounds like it’s external. Could you just comment on what you’re looking for and why there’s no internal candidates being vetted?
Ronald Jadin: Our business has become more complex and we are – have looked at sort of the spec we want for a CFO, and we feel like we should cast away in that. So we’re going to look externally and find somebody who can handle the complexity of the regulatory environment, things have changed pretty substantially. And so we feel like that’s the right thing to do to look for the best candidate and we will find the best candidate we can find anywhere.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question come from Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hi, guys. Can you update us on your free cash flow guidance? I don’t – I didn’t see an update there, and I would think it would have to come down relative to the restructuring charges you’re taking?
Ronald Jadin: I’ll take it. This is Ron. Our free cash flow continues to be strong and it is kind of counterintuitive I suppose. There’s a lot of the restructuring that we’re doing at probably 80% of it is non-cash. So Colombia is a great example of that. So that has really affected our cash flow. And so while operationally there’s some pressure because of performance. There’s also a fair amount of cash flow we’re generating through the sale of the branches that we closed over the last two years. So, we expect free cash flow to continue to be strong and it’s up 10%, as we speak.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay, there’s no real change than I guess…
Ronald Jadin: No. To give you a sense though, the Colombia is a $42 million charge and over $30 million of it’s actually non-cash. So that it’s not as big of a cash event as it is an earnings event.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. Okay and then just as it relates to the whole industry, I know there’s definitely some skepticism in terms of where your pricing is relative to your competition. Can you give us, I don’t know some details or some confidence in that you’re not – you’re still not going to be the lowest price or in the industry, or I don’t know what it takes. It doesn’t seem a lot to be – the market doesn’t seem to be believing, but that’s the case. But at what point does the – to the price had stop, I guess is what we’re trying to gain confidence in?
D.G. Macpherson: So I can tell you, we’re looking at the competitive environment very closely. We’re not setting our web prices to be near the bottom on the stat. One thing I would say is, we actually spent a little bit of marketing money in the quarter on customer acquisition. At those put for items that we already changed on web prices and we had a very good response on small volume. And so I think we’ve shown and proved to ourselves that we can acquire customers at a price that is not low. It’s competitive, but it’s not low. And so, we don’t feel like we’re going to have to – we know we’re not going to have to be lowest price and we feel like we’re positioning the price virtually.
Andrew Buscaglia: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Duncan with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.
Will Steinwart: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Will Steinwart on the call for Matt.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Will Steinwart: On the relative success you’re getting with the medium customer volume response versus the large customer, what’s the one point sequential volume pickup with the large group in line with your expectations for the quarter as we’ve seen the backdrop improved throughout the last three months and the year overall?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, it was in line with our expectations. So keep in mind that large customers most of their prices had always been competitive. And so the price change will have less of an impact initially with large customers and then well at midsized. And so we would expect shift in midsized to be much bigger than our – with larger customers, and so it was right at our expectations for the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Belfiore with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Belfiore: Good morning, guys. So, yes, I just wanted to kind of go back to some of the earlier comments on – in terms of the trends in the quarter. But just kind of looking in the back of the slides, you kind of put the sales by end market. I mean and I understand like you’re saying that government kind of fell off. But it says it was flat for the quarter in some of the other pieces that are similar size or even lower. So I’m just kind of curious like – can you, is there – can you kind of provide some cadence on like, how government, like what government actually did from month-to-month? And then how light, I mean, how something like a light manufacturing, it sounds like it got better, because you’re saying that government was kind of thelot – the most – the biggest lagger in the quarter, but it was still down for the – light manufacturing was still down for the quarter?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, so the back-half of the quarter the government was down and everything else, the trend stayed stable effectively is the way to think about. I think that’s your question is, we saw a significant year-over-year down with government as state, local, and federal in some cases health funding. But everything else just kind of continued on similar trends.
Ronald Jadin: I think government was up low double-digit in the first-half of the quarter, I believe. So it was the big change that of a second-half.
D.G. Macpherson: Government started the quarter very strongly and ended very, very slowly. And these are all – just keep in mind these are all very large contracts that we have with the government, so it’s completely independent of our pricing action and really what they chose to spend or not spend.
Chris Belfiore: Okay. And then just on the marketing that you guys will be able to do more thoroughly once you all of the SKUs were kind of on a web pricing in the second-half of the year. Just a lot of the sales are going through e-commerce. So I’m just kind of curious like if there are some kind of examples of like kind of what Grainger, the kind of marketing kind of Grainger’s like looking to be in terms of the stuff like click through rates in terms of like searches by customers and addressing kind of like that kind of part of the business?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we have a lot of examples of doing this very well, particularly the online model with MonotaRO and Zoro. So lot of this is marketing spend online with a paid search of product listing ads. The dynamic we’ve had on the U.S. for a long time is that, if we had a customer click through as we paid – used paid search advertising, they would click through a price that was or they see a price the visible price that was much higher than the competition. So the difference now is when they click through, they’ll see something that is reasonable, and that marketing will have a much higher return than it had historically. We haven’t had great returns in the U.S., but particularly on new customer acquisition with marketing where we have with MonotaRO, for example. And so as we think about this, we’re going to spend marketing spend to acquire customers and then to acquire contacts within existing customers and the return on that should be much better than we see in the past because of our pricing.
Ronald Jadin: And as a result, we’ll spend significantly more than we have in the past on that area.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, it make more sense to spend more, the return is much better.
Chris Belfiore: Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Baumann: Hi, good morning, guys.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Patrick Baumann: Just a question on volume. Just curious what your volume expectations are for the U.S. segment in the back half of the year? What kind of pick up you have embedded in the guidance? I’m getting to kind of high single digits versus the 5% you did in the second quarter and would look like maybe 4% in June. Just curious if that’s in the range. And then you mentioned July, you’re seeing some of the government issues loosen up, and just curious how July to-date is trending on volume for the U.S. segment?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, in the back-half of the year, we’re expecting 6% to 8% of volume growth. And so fairly strong volume growth based on the price changes and some marketing ads. I think the government is probably a wildcard still in terms of what happens we – we’ve heard rumors of things easing up, but we will need to see it. So we’ll see what happens with the government.
Patrick Baumann: And in July, how are things trending?
D.G. Macpherson: We are not talking about much at this point.
Patrick Baumann: Okay. And second question would be just any update on the 2018 plus kind of margin progression for both gross and operating margin? Just a lot moving around as we exit this year with the price downs overlapping into next year and just trying to get a feel for the past 12% to 13% you still expect for 2019?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, we are very focused on actually in the price – the pricing changes effectively on improving our cost structure. We will provide 2018 guidance at the Analyst Day in November.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and my congrats to Ron also. Hey, my question is a bit to address your longer-term growth expectations in light of the new pricing. So if this quarter, we learned 4% down price drives 5% in volume, how do you hit a 6% to 8% revenue growth target out in 2018, 2019 without the benefit of further discounting? So is it a flat pricing environment? How do you get flat pricing environment and to drive 6% to 8% volume growth?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, when your prices are – your visible prices are much higher than the competition, and you do things like digital marketing, you don’t get the returns that you get. So this will enable us to spend on marketing dollars from midsized customer for customer acquisition like we have been able to do before. I would also say that when you sit down and talk with our customers, customers like as recently as yesterday, they are very excited if we are reasonably priced to give us a whole bunch of more volume. And so we’re pretty excited about – they’re pretty excited about the prospect and not having to come to us for negotiations for SKU level decisions. And so we feel like that’s going to change the game pretty substantially. Thus far, we’ve only changed partial prices. And so what you’ve seen so far is a partial response to the pricing changes and that will change start again in August.
Deane Dray: What portion of your SKUs have had the reprice to web pricing? Can you size it by – either by customer base or by percent of SKUs?
D.G. Macpherson: So percent of SKUs online spend 400 some thousand, so it’s been 25% to 35% have been repriced or repriced at the beginning of the year and that that will be all of them soon. And at the percentage of volume, I think that the most important thing to recognize, it was large customer volume, large customer pricing was already competitive. So the impact has been fairly small thus far on large customers. We renegotiated a bunch of contracts in the last 60 days that will change that dynamic. But so far large customer prices really haven’t been all that different this year than they’ve been in the past in many cases.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then just last question for me is on the buyback program. What would cause you to put the program on hold? And just the thought here is, do you see risks in continuing to lever up the balance sheet to fund buybacks when the business model is in such a state of change right now?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, Deane, that’s a great question. I guess I go back to the strength of our cash flow generation through cycles is very strong. As you know, we reinvested about a third of our cash back in the business and the other two-thirds given back to shareholders. So there’s a lot of excess cash. So, that’s not a real concern of ours at all. We buy through the cycles. We’ll continue to buy back shares as we’ve given a guidance in the past. We’ll continue on that same path.
Deane Dray: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Dankert: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess just first off, you mentioned Cromwell was having some issues given the Brexit concerns and rolling out the new initiatives, I guess. Any update on what the growth rate look like there in the quarter and just kind of where profitability is at? I think last we knew was near break-even, is that still the case?
Ronald Jadin: This is for which business are you trying to refer to Cromwell?
Chris Dankert: Cromwell, yes.
Ronald Jadin: Yes. So, we think we gained a little bit of share in the first-half of the year. The market is down slightly, we’re up slightly. So that that’s our volume growth – our sales growth in Cromwell. The business is right around break-even now from a – from an earnings perspective. Keep in mind that that includes fairly significant investments we’ve made in the supply chain over the last nine months to go more to a direct-to-customer model. And we feel like that business will bounce back profitably wise fairly quickly and positive next year. So we’re not concerned about the long-term health of the business. We – but it has been a market challenge and the other thing has been a challenge is the currency change with the British pound has caused us to chase some price increases and the GP line has suffered..
Chris Dankert: Got it. And then just, any update on the status of the ERP transition in Canada? I mean, has that been more of a hindrance on trying to get those branches realigned or is that actually kind of help you identify opportunity at this point?
Ronald Jadin: Well, I would say, for about a year, it was a big hindrance of doing any things. We had a bunch of service problems in the business. We are now a stable service, is good in the business. And we’re able to take a fresh look and really get after improving the fundamental operations and profitability of the business. It actually helps us now. We have more visibility into where there are – where there’s profitable portions of the business and where there isn’t. So right now it’s working well and stable.
Chris Dankert: Understood. Thanks so much.
Ronald Jadin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Nigel Coe: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Just going back to the government swing between the first portion of 2Q and the latter portion understanding that there were some budget pressures in certain states. But any sense on what would such a big swing? And also just to clarify, does that impact the spot purchases, because my impression was that the government sector had less spot purchases?
D.G. Macpherson: I don’t think in this case, it had much impact on spot purchases in the aggregate. So we have a very clear view to the pipeline and many of our government customers. And so the pipeline looks pretty good, but the money didn’t release at the end of the second quarter and that was – you can tie into very specific state and local governments and very specific federal agencies, it just did not release any money. So in this case, it’s pretty easy to see what’s going on, and assuming that you release the money, it will come back, but it’s very easy to see what’s going on from a pipeline perspective.
Nigel Coe: Okay. So just to clarify that the government sector did impact the slowdown in spot purchase between 2Q and the first-half of 2Q?
D.G. Macpherson: It would have been a little bit of a hindrance for that. Sure, yes, absolutely.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Okay, and then just maybe a follow on maybe for Ron. The accounts receivable seems quite high in relation to historical norms in 2Q? Anything driving that higher AR balance?
Ronald Jadin: No, nothing unusual. Volume is up a fair amount. It’s just timing of collections and when the year-end closes off versus kind of the first-half of the year. This had a – it’s really just timing. There’s nothing unusual with DSO. The underlying DSO – that’s been – that’s remained stable.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Ronald Jadin: Yep.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and Ron, congrats on your coming transition. I had a question on, the gross margin performance relative to the magnitude of the price resets is pretty impressive. I’m wondering, was there any reallocation of how costs get put into COGS versus SG&A along the way?
Ronald Jadin: No, we see some COGS deflation, but there is no reallocation as just the actual performance.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, great. That’s all I had. Thanks.
Ronald Jadin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning and congratulations, Ron. My first question is simply if we can go to chart 10, I’m trying to understand what sort of on the other side of the equal sign here. So we’ve got incremental expenses 2017 to 2019 listed. The cost takeout obviously goes the other way. Are you expecting mix to be the entire gap filler between what’s written here and the plus 100 basis points of operating margin expectation in 2019?
Ronald Jadin: No, there’s a fair amount of volume leverage as well.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes.
Ronald Jadin: So what…
D.G. Macpherson: What should happen is in 2019, our price should stabilize and so that volume growth in 2019 actually is positive for GP dollars. And then this – when you put this the expense picture below it, you get to the earnings guidance we’ve had before.
Scott Graham: Okay. So what you’re saying here is that the WM&A percent of sales should start to more meaningfully come down than we saw in this quarter?
Ronald Jadin: Yes. Yes, percent of sales should absolutely, yes.
Scott Graham: Okay.
D.G. Macpherson: And I just wanted to make a comment earlier about the sequential GP rate. There’s nothing unusual in the quarter GP rate, but sequentially to the first quarter, there is an anomaly in the first quarter. And I’ll just go back to the press release from that, because it’s there year-over-year and it’s how our national sales meeting is accounted for and there are some costs that are moved between expenses and GP. So that does create a sequential difference from the first quarter to the second, and – but it’s just accounting-related, it’s not operational.
Scott Graham: My follow up was simply, is it all possible that the U.S. June slowdown was maybe a function of customers maybe sitting on their hands a little bit, waiting for more price actions?
Ronald Jadin: No, we don’t believe we’ve seen that behavior and talking to customers that doesn’t appear to be a behavior. Customers typically just buy. I mean, they’re not stockpiling inventory in our business and they buy when they need it. So given that’s kind of $300 at a time, we don’t expect to see much of that.
Scott Graham: All right, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning. Just first question, could you maybe give us some color as to what sort of a service premium you think on pricing is justified post your repricing actions? Is it 10%, 15%? And then what our customers think for? Is it product availability? It seems like technical support maybe a little bit in your portfolio part, just help us with some of that? Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes. So, Hamzah, I won’t talk about a specific percentage of them, actually that’s appropriate to talk about publicly. But – so let me tell you about the customer conversations we had. Yesterday, I was talking with a customer, and their perspective was, they get things the product availability, a wide range of products it comes quickly. But their perspective was also that, we provide them with a whole lot of support around safety service around inventory management services. We’ve embedded ourselves to help and manage our inventory. We understand how the business runs. We help them. I talked to somebody who places the orders. We talked about six people in the organization. And his view was, your orders are the easiest to place, easiest to get resolved, because you understand how our business operates and you link with our process very, very well. So there’s a whole range of the way we operate, which will allow us to command a premium in the market as long as that premium isn’t, so visible and so large.
Hamzah Mazari: And – thank you. And just a follow on, could you maybe update us on the current structure of the sales force? How much is insight sales now? And is there any opportunity on sales force efficiency remaining in – at the company? Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: So we have – we’re mostly outside sellers calling on large complex customers. We have an inside sales team calling on midsized customers, but most of the numbers are in outside sales. We – there’s a couple of things going on. One is, we think pricing will allow those dollars to grow revenue, have better conversations and more conversations without having to talk about price as much and we feel like the revenue per sellers should increase. We should get more penetration at those account. So we look at revenue per seller pretty closely. Our expectation is we will get significant improvements based on the pricing actions, based on the tools we’re providing sellers, based on the number of factors and we are confident we’ll start to get more productivity out of the sales organization.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. Thank you. Best of luck, Ron. Thanks.
Ronald Jadin: Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your questions.
Robert Barry: Hey, guys, good morning. Can you hear me?
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, thank you.
Robert Barry: Great, lots of ground covered. So we’re halfway through the year, it sounds like the quarter was as expected. Should we be thinking the midpoint of the range as where you’re tracking at this point, still a pretty wide range out there?
D.G. Macpherson: I think based on the quarter, that would be a reasonable assumption. I would say that the quarter was as expected, given the changes going on in the business, given what’s going to happen in August 1. We’re very confident in the past, but there’s no reason to alter our guidance at this point. We feel like, we’re on the right path.
Robert Barry: Kind of tracking to the middle, okay. And then just, I guess a question on price cost. What are you seeing in terms of COGS inflation on kind of a like-for-like product basis? It seems like we’re increasingly in an inflationary environment. And then what’s happening to pricing outside of spot buys and medium? Is there any place you think outside of those areas that you’re able to raise price? What’s the thought there? Thanks.
D.G. Macpherson: Yes, so we are – our COGS this year are likely going to be on the 0.5%, and we are not seeing huge inflationary pressure moving through, there is a little bit, but not much. If in fact, we got inflation, we would be able to get price in the number of places and number of customers. It works that way to see whether that happens, but we’re not – we have not seen any inflation in our COGS at this point.
Robert Barry: Okay. It seems like a little bit of an outlier, because a lot of the others have been talking about starting to see inflation and having some challenges getting price. But I mean any reason why you’re not seeing inflation or actually seeing deflation?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, I think we have worked very hard putting processes to manage COGS. We work – we’ve put in new processes to really understand the competitive environment, understand what products should cost and build that into our work with suppliers. I think we’ve done a nice job of managing it.
Robert Barry: Gotcha. Thank you.
D.G. Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Ritchie: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations, Ron, as well. My first question I guess just going back to Nigel’s question earlier on spot, it sounds like the government business didn’t really impact the spot performance as the quarter went on. So what specifically led to kind of weaker performance of spot as we progress through 2Q?
D.G. Macpherson: No government business did impacted and we saw for large customers spot buy x government was pretty stable throughout quarter.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. And maybe thinking about spot longer-term, how – D.G., how are you thinking about the like mix of business moving forward? The spot remain 30% of your large customer base, or is – does that number just trend down over time?
D.G. Macpherson: We actually hope the trends up. I think when we’re talking to customers now about the new pricing structure, both us and they would like to get out of the situation where we have to negotiate every item. And so our hope is as we grow midsized customers as we grow long-contract customers, as we get the new contracts in with contract customers that actually spot buy will grow and we feel like we can make that happen.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. And maybe one quick follow-up here. Just thinking about the guidance for the year, you guys have alluded to the price downs that are coming in the second-half to call it five to six point the price downs. How are we – how are you guys thinking about the gross margin the year-over-year change in the second-half? I think the guidance for the full-year is still down 160. What does that imply for 2H in your guidance?
D.G. Macpherson: It’s down. It’s a little bit more significantly third and fourth quarter over the prior years than it is in the first-half. So it’s worsening, but we haven’t given guidance on that per se. We’ve kind of stayed with the whole year. I think our total year guidance is still good, just a little – obviously a little bit worse in the second-half than the first-half on a year-over-year comp.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. And maybe even more specifically then in terms of offsetting the pricing declines like I know that you’re thinking about 6% to 8% type volume growth. What are – what other items should we be thinking about as potential offsets to the pricing?
D.G. Macpherson: A product mix continues to be favorable for us. And what I mean by that is we’re – it’s not offsetting GP rate, but it’s at least mitigating some of it. And that’s the growth we’re seeing with the medium-sized customers in particular and the product they’re buying that even though their price reduced they’re still at margins above the company average. And so that does provide a partial mix offset.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Bergner: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions, D.G. and Ron.
D.G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Justin Bergner: On Cromwell, I’m trying to understand, it looks like it was a pretty sizable operating profit hit year-on-year in terms of dollars. Could you – is that going to disappear as we move into the second-half of the year, or is that a permanently sort of rebased margin for Cromwell?
D.G. Macpherson: Well, it’s not a permanently rebased margin. A lot of that has to do with the currency and the currency shifts having an impact on GP rate. And so we are working through pricing changes as a result of that. But when that happens typically, we like that and so we have to make that up. We’re also working on the plans to get back to where we need to be starting in 2018. So it’s not a permanent change. It’s just a pretty significant change given the currency translation.
Justin Bergner: And why did that mainly kick in the second quarter and not the first quarter on Cromwell?
Ronald Jadin: I mean, commodity inflation we can often see right we have negotiations with suppliers. We can increase prices when we see true commodity inflation. But when a currency changes overnight, there is always a lag effect that’s going back to customers and repricing.
Justin Bergner: Okay. And then just one last question when we get to August and sort of the second round of pricing changes, I’m just would love some clarity as to what’s going to sort of change for large customers versus what’s going to differentially change for medium customers come August?
Ronald Jadin: Well, for large customers, the biggest change will be more competitive prices in the items that they don’t buy frequently. So they will have – we will have renegotiated contracts in many cases. They will be more competitive in the tail of their purchases. For midsized customers, we will have price that will allow us to acquire customers now will be very, very new. So that will be very different than we’ve had historically. We talked about 50% of our volume at competitive prices of midsized customers, that’s part of the story. We don’t actually have business with most of midsized customers in the U.S. So we have a big football field to go out and try to acquire customers now. We’re going to go, go after that, so that will be very, very different.
Justin Bergner: And the change in the pricing book for large customers against what you described, as you know, fairly competitive pricing for more regular purchases, that’s all taken effect for large customers by now for the most part?
Ronald Jadin: That will balance one for the most part. There are still some contracts that are having holding the same contracts, because they have renewals coming up in the next year. But for the most part it will have taken place.
Justin Bergner: Okay. Thank you.
Ronald Jadin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
John Inch: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Ron, I don’t – I forget if you mentioned this. But I know you guys typically have this customer sponsored trade show in the first quarter. Did you get where the reimbursement benefit that helped gross kind of second quarter versus first quarter versus last year, is it?
Ronald Jadin: Yes, yes. John, there was and I was trying to – I probably didn’t say it well, but our national sales and service meeting in the first quarter….
John Inch: Yes.
Ronald Jadin: …is funded by suppliers, and so a lot of that expense gets moved up the COGS. And so that does create an anomaly for us between the first quarter and the second quarter for sequential GP rate. And I would just suggest you go back to how we explained on the first quarter. I don’t have that information with me, but it should be in our press release. That actually is in the first quarter and a little bit in the second quarter actually where we have to account for that, but…
John Inch: I guess, my question, Ron is, was there any timing difference of the reimbursement year-over-year that benefited your GP in the second quarter versus last year? So in other words, last year you got more reimbursement in the first quarter than this year you got in the second quarter?
Ronald Jadin: Just a few million dollars, nothing material of year-over-year variance.
John Inch: Okay. I mean lot of questions around the growth. This is sort of the big picture question. Ron and D.G., how do you know that Zoro isn’t actually cannibalizing, purchasing at Grainger or sale took Grainger in some manner kind of obviously on an indirect basis? But is there anyway to kind of prove or disprove that hypothesis?
Ronald Jadin: Yes. So we do a lot of analysis on Zoro. And the vast majority of the Zoro volume comes from small businesses that Grainger has not had a relationship with. So most of the customer file, we have no business with at all, the Zoro customer file. There’s a little bit of cannibalization that is very, very small. I would also say when you visit Orange customers, you don’t really hear Zoro come up at all. It is not a discussion point. So we don’t. We know the cannibalization rate is very, very small.
John Inch: Okay. And then just finally, you mentioned that 80% of these charges right were non-cash. Why is that? Like, what – can you give me an example of what would be the nature of some non-cash write-down? And what would be the payback of the cash component of the $1.29 of charges, or of the cash component of that?
Ronald Jadin: So and D.G. alluded to Colombia before, the big non-cash item there is foreign exchange.
John Inch: Yes.
Ronald Jadin: So cumulative translation adjustment, it’s on the balance sheet and it has to get flush through the P&L. That currency has weakened substantially in the last five years. And so, that’s a like $15 million by itself, that’s a pretty big non-cash item. So the things the typically would be cash would be severance right things like that. I don’t say a little bit of it is writing down some inventory at branches that were closing up in Canada. Most of the inventory we moved, but it becomes an opportunity to dispose some of the very slow moving items as opposed to handling it again and moving into another branch. So there’s some of that we sell. We actually generate cash on some of those, but we take some book accounting it.
John Inch: It sounds like this would probably benefit your free cash next year then, all else equal?
Ronald Jadin: Yes, for the branches that we own, I mean, this all depends on the market, right, the real estate market. But in the U.S. certainly, it has helped us. Now just to be clear from a P&L perspective, we have some gains and we pulled that out. So that the gains and/or losses, but it’s been gains, because gains are removed just like the restructuring costs are removed. So we talk about year-over-year adjusted results, none of that is in there, right. So it’s an apples-to-apples comparison. But it has helped us a little bit on cash flow the last couple of years and probably will next year as well.
John Inch: Got it. Thank you.
Ronald Jadin: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.
D.G. Macpherson: So thanks for joining us this morning. Just to reiterate, we performed as we expected during the quarter. I think, the exciting points are that we’re starting to see growth in places that are really important for a long-term profitability, most notably midsized customers and large customers stop buy. We are continuing to make the portfolio stronger, making sure that the businesses we have are profitable and have profitable growth. Our actions in Canada, we are taking an eye towards improving profitability much faster there and took some significant actions in the quarter. We’ll keep talking about what we’re doing there. And we really believe that we are very well positioned to improve the customer experience. The conversations we have with customers around pricing have been fantastic. There has been no walking by customers. They’re very happy with what the direction we’re taking. They understand that we have a great service. They understand that we have a strong digital experience. They understand that we have a strong onsite experience. We’re going to continue to leverage those things to grow the business and we’re really excited about the path we’re on. So with that, thanks for joining us and take care.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to W.W. Grainger’s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Laura Brown, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Laura Brown: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Grainger’s Q1 quarterly earnings call. With me is DG Macpherson, CEO and Ron Jadin, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking, based on our current risk of future events and our actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. These documents are available on our IR website together with reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures. Now DG will be making some opening comments regarding the performance of the Company with a deeper dive on our pricing actions specifically in the U.S. He will then turn the call over to Ron to discuss the financial implications of our pricing actions along with updated 2017 and 2019 guidance. After closing remarks, we'll open the call for questions. DG to you.
Donald G. Macpherson: Thanks Laura, and thanks everyone for joining us today. So the main event as Laura implicated was price for the quarter. And as we discussed in November, we are laser focused on creating value for our customers. Customers value our product breadth and delivery capabilities, they value our sales and service model for large customers, and they value our strong customer service capabilities overall. But we all know that our prices have been a significant source of dissatisfaction for our customers. And we really haven't been able to leverage digital capabilities like digital marketing to acquire new customers and to grow with existing customers. As a result, we've taken action to improve our pricing, so that we can grow share with existing customers and attract new customers. Now in the quarter the volume response to the pricing changes was faster, more immediate and stronger than we anticipated. Given this response, we've made the decision to accelerate our pricing actions this year. This is absolutely the right thing to do for the business and it provides Grainger with a sustainable long-term platform for future growth. It allows us to market our offer more aggressively. The decision to accelerate involves a large GP write-down in the short-term, but it is accretive to earnings over the long-term. Ron is going to talk about the changes to guidance as a result of this acceleration later in the call. Before I go into more detail on pricing, I’m going to talk about Company results for a few minutes. Now as a reminder, this morning's call is going to focus really entirely on adjusted results which exclude restructuring. So revenue in the quarter was up 1%, volume was healthy at up 5%. Our gross profit and our operating margin were significantly impacted by the pricing actions which we mentioned before. Operating earnings were down 14%, operating cash flow was actually up 13% driven mostly by working capital. So I am going to talk about non-U.S. businesses first; so our other businesses which includes our online model and our businesses in LATAM, Europe and China performed as expected. Other business sales were up 12% and that includes a 3% headwind from foreign exchange. Operating earnings for the segment were up 45%. Now the online business is driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the U.S. continued to deliver strong sales growth of 23% and the operating margin in those businesses expanded by 100 basis points, so great progress with the online model. Switching to Canada for a moment, our sales increased 1% in local currency. The good news here is that our service levels have stabilized and we're hearing very good things from our customers in terms of those service levels. We started pricing actions in Canada where contract customers were implementing additional price increases that really are going to offset currency related COGS inflation. As you might recall, during the ERP implementation, we did not take price increases that related to currency translation we otherwise would have. The service stabilization took longer than anticipated and that has delayed the realization of our price increases. For non-contract customers, we are introducing – also introducing market-based pricing somewhat to that in the U.S. In the quarter, gross margin in Canada declined 270 basis points versus the prior year and while price increases have lagged our plans, we have seen sequential improvement month-by-month in the first quarter. Year-over-year in Canada, our operating expenses were up and that's really impacted by two things. The first is 2016 had the sale of the old Toronto distribution center that obviously did not repeat this share. So that was a gain or a benefit in 2016, not repeat in 2017. And the other is we reinstated the annual sales meeting this year which did not take place as we went through the ERP limitation in 2016. Based on continued service improvements, based on the pricing actions we are taking and starting to see some progress on and based on the strong cost actions we will put in place, we still plan to breakeven as we exit 2017. And as we go forward more fully describe our actions and progress in Canada in the coming months. So turning to the U.S., U.S. results are really all about the strategic pricing actions that we are taking. Sales in the U.S. were down 1%, but volume was up 4% entirely driven by price. So let's talk about pricing. As we discussed in November, our price structure has been a period of growth across the business. With midsized customers, it has hurt our ability to acquire new customers and it also hurt our ability to penetrate midsized customers. With large customers, pricing has been a barrier to capturing all of the volume with customers, our customers tell us time and again that they want to consolidate their purchases with us, but our price has been a barrier to that spot buy. So we took action in the quarter to lay the foundation for sustainable share gain and customer acquisition. In January, we adjusted list prices to support large customers consolidating their purchases. That resulted in some list prices going up and some going down. That was a huge change from a list price perspective in the quarter. In early February, we introduced web pricing for about 450,000 SKUs, which is essentially market based pricing. To get that pricing customers today have to opt in to that price online or on the phone. We also continue to negotiate large customer contracts with the updated pricing structure that's a process that we started in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a reminder, large contract customers generally have competitive prices. We're adjusting the structure to make it more attractive for them to consolidate all of their volume with Grainger. So our initial results from the pricing actions have been positive. We saw stronger than expected price elasticity on the list price changes that means both places where we've raised prices and places where we've lowered price. For large and midsized non-contract customers who opted into our web pricing program, volume had been declining at double-digits and is now growing at mid-single digits. Now this is off a relatively small base, but it is a representative base, it represents only a third of our assortment, and we have not yet been able to market web prices aggressively given the requirement for customers to opt into the new pricing. For contract customers where we have implemented pricing changes for the spot buy purchases. Our results are quite encouraging, total volume growth for these customers has increased from 4% to 9%. We've now work through enough contracts to get a feel for how customers will respond to these changes and these customers are very supportive of these changes. Overall, we've also seen customers buying at their new price points versus requesting quotes. This is a good sign it affirms that more relevant pricing simplifies the process and makes Grainger easier to do business with. So spending a moment on volume, we've seen the strongest volume growth in two years for the quarter. And we expect to see volume grow in the U.S., about 6% for the year and while some of this is certainly a slightly improved market, our volume performance this year should be improved on a relative basis. So we're excited about the volume trends. Now based on these results, we've made the decision to accelerate our pricing actions into 2017. The actions will begin in the third quarter and will include three things. We will introduce web prices on the entire assortment SKUs and eliminate the opt-in requirement at that time. We will add digital marketing under the Grainger brand. So we are going to use digital marketing to acquire customers under the Grainger brand, which we've not been able to do, and we're going to accelerate the large contract customer negotiations during the period between now in the third quarter. We are excited about these actions and we expect them to speed up customer retention efforts to accelerate our customer acquisition and help us gain back the spot buy volume, and we will also help us simplify our pricing structure and accelerate our ability to lower expenses relative to our price complexity today and it also allows to put the pricing change behind us faster, enabling stronger sales growth and improved operating margins. With these changes, there is obviously an impact this year Ron will talk about, but we do expect to be back on track to hit our 2019 guidance, operating margin of 12% to 13%. Importantly, we are going to eliminate a significant barrier for our customers, while we won't have the lowest price in the market, we will be competitive which will be a very attractive for our customers given our industry leading supply chain and service model. Ron is going to talk about guidance in a minute, but our expectation is that the pricing acceleration will allow us to change our trajectory and get back to our long-term operating margin guidance by 2019. To do that we are going to have to continue on the cost leverage path that we have been on for the last few years. Now to be clear, this is a huge change for Grainger. It's not an easy one to execute, but this is absolutely the right thing to do. We will be more competitive. We will provide a much better customer experience and we are going to allow Grainger to compete leading with our strikes. So with that, I will turn it over to Ron.
Ronald Jadin: Thanks, DG. As DG noted, we've decided to accelerate the pricing actions in the U.S. this year versus spreading them out over a multi-year period to drive faster volume growth across all customers and enables more aggressive marketing to new and existing customers. On Slide 12, we explain the effect of our Q1 pricing actions and the acceleration. We will post additional reference slides to the IR site after the call. The top of the slide, the pie charts represents the U.S. large and medium business or $7 billion of the approximately $8 billion total U.S. segment, which includes specialty brands and inter-company sales to Zoro. The numbers below the line represents the U.S. segment. Today of the total $7 billion in U.S. large and medium business 60% or roughly $4 million is competitively priced and we will adjust prices as appropriate with inflation and other factors. $2 billion is less competitively priced and will be addressed through our contracting process. Previous guidance anticipated this taking multiple years. We've since found a way to expedite the process, removing the barrier to accelerating web pricing. This also enables us to regain some of the spot buy business we were losing. We expect this work to be complete by the end of 2018. So as you move to the pie charts on the right you see that slice of the pie goes away over the course of 2017 and 2018. So $1 billion is also less competitively priced and it is not part of a contract. With the web price acceleration in the third quarter of 2017 and more aggressive marketing will reverse the share decline in acquiring new customers. When you look at the full-year 2017 that slice of the pie will be competitively priced. First quarter pricing actions that DG mentioned earlier drove price deflation of 4% and GP margin decline of 190 basis points for the U.S. segment. With the acceleration of our pricing action from 2018 into the third quarter of 2017, we now expect U.S. price deflation of 5% for the year and a gross margin decline of 210 basis points in 2017. GP declines at a lesser rate than price in 2017 due to a benefit from COGS deflation as well as favorable mix. In 2018, the pie chart on the far right and the numbers on the bottom right corner, our pricing strategy will be fully deployed and the negative impact on price and GP rate will be complete. Now let's take a look at our 2017 guidance. Our first quarter results generated a higher customer volume response at lower price points versus our expectations. Accordingly, we recognized the need to lower our 2017 guidance. The middle column illustrates our 2017 assumption based on our learnings from the first quarter. This would put us at the low end of our January EPS guidance after removing the $0.13 benefit from the accounting change noted in the earnings release. Footnotes A and B on the slide reflect this point. The last column highlights the midpoint of our revised guidance including the price acceleration. It anticipates an incremental operating earnings write-down to $75 million comprised of $60 million in gross margin decline and $15 million in marketing expense to support the newly visible web pricing. The corresponding EPS write-down is $0.80 getting us to a midpoint of $10.65. Please reference our earnings release supplement for the new sales and EPS guidance ranges. On Slide 14, the price acceleration is a headwind to 2017 and 2018 gross profit margin, but enables us to recover operating margin by 2019. Our 2019 operating margin expectations of 12% to 13% remain consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day last November. Favorable mix and continued strong cost productivity and volume leverage allow us to stay on track and better positions us for stronger volume share gains and margin growth well into the future. Now I’ll turn it back to DG for closing remarks.
Donald G. Macpherson: Thank you, Ron. Cost productivity is a key component to making sure that we achieve our forward-looking goals, I think it's important to understand the progress that we've made on cost. So the chart shows that over the last four years, we've demonstrated an ability to manage expenses and to drive productivity and we're going to continue to do so going forward. We generally look at both expense to sales and expense to COGS, which is more of an activity metric to measure our progress. And you'll hear more from us as we go through the year on how we're going to get to 2019, but continuing this cost leverage path is going to be a very important part of that story and we feel like we've got strong momentum here to continue to improve our cost structure. So overall, it was a challenging quarter, but we are very focused on what matters to drive value. We continue to be encouraged by the growth and the profit improvement of our online businesses, we've stabilized service levels in Canada, we need to do a lot more to improve both price realization and the cost structure of the business. In the U.S., the pricing acceleration is going to allow us to be more aggressive in our marketing efforts to drive market share gains and to allow new customer acquisition with the Grainger brand. Most importantly, we are completely focused on creating a flawless customer experience. So a change of this nature is challenging and it's complex. We know this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of the business and we are committed to making the changes needed to accelerate growth and to get back to the profitability that we expect. So with that, I will open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. And now I’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
David Manthey: Hi. Good morning, all.
Donald G. Macpherson: Good morning.
David Manthey: First question is as it relates to this trade-off between price and volume. They have significantly different impacts on overall profitability, given that prices it reads through at such a high rate. So what I'm thinking about here is as you look at these efforts, do you think that several years down the road you'll be able to breakeven in terms of profit dollars or does your profitability take a secular step down in the process here?
Donald G. Macpherson: Thanks Dave. I think it's a great question. And our expectation now is that we were more than breakeven in terms of profit dollars as we get the volume growth and improve our cost structure to get the operating margins back to our expectations. So it's a significant challenge in 2017 and 2018, but by 2019 we feel like our profit dollars will be at or higher than they would otherwise have been.
David Manthey: Okay. I guess we don't have the slides here, I guess other than the webcast, so I’ll have to take a look at those later, but at your Analyst Day you shared with us some data that showed how more competitive pricing leads to faster growth among medium and larger customers. What happened in the first quarter that surprised you relative to that data? It sounds like something happened that you didn't expect here in the first quarter, but you have that data lined up, it seems like you had a pretty good beat on it initially, what was different?
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes. It’s a great question. So I would say that the behavior at a customer level, so if you think about large customers who go along the new pricing model or small, mid-sized customers that opt-in to web pricing was exactly as we would have expected. I think the web pricing uptick was maybe a little higher without doing any marketing that which will be expected, but generally those two were as expected. The big change was when we altered the list prices that had a big impact – a bigger impact than we expected both on prices that we raised and prices that declined. And so that had an immediate impact that we were not fully expecting and that has been the biggest part of the surprise. Now that's long-term not particularly relevant because we will get out of the list price game and we will go to web prices and so web prices are going to be the full story. But in the short-term that has been the biggest surprise that we have.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead with your questions.
Ryan Merkel: Thanks. First is the 2019 long-term operating margin guidance of 12%, 13%, is that the new long-term range? Or is that just the signpost to the 2021 guidance that you had previously at 13% to 14%?
Ronald Jadin: Yes, that's just a guidepost for where we're heading Ryan so that's – we're not saying anything new about 2021.
Ryan Merkel: Got it, okay. And then what gross margin are you assuming in the 2019 guidance?
Ronald Jadin: Sure, so we have guidance for 2017 and 2018 on the pie chart and – for the U.S. segment, we have expect the U.S. segment in the company going with it probably GP margin improvement of 25 to 50 basis points. So that's where we start to see the volume of the favorable mix outpaced the pricing, because we get the pricing behind this in 2018.
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes. And I would just add a point, we've been talking for probably close to 10 years about unfavorable customer mix and when we make these changes, our expectation is by 2019 that's not going to be the story that we're going to have a favorable mix and start growing parts of the business that haven't been growing that are actually more profitable.
Ryan Merkel: Okay. I don't have the slide deck either. But it sounds like you're saying that 2017 is the bottom for gross margin and that you could actually expect it to rise in 2018 and 2019?
Ronald Jadin: No, we expect 2018 to be the bottom because the changes we make in the second half of this year will also flow through to 2018. We expected to rise in 2019 Ryan.
Ryan Merkel: Got it, okay. And then lastly on price, just two part question, was the two-year plan always for lower prices around that 4% level? And then secondly, can you unpack how you arrive at the price down for? What are the pieces?
Donald G. Macpherson: Well, so that the short answer Ryan is that it's not – it’s very similar to what we always expected in terms of the price impact overall. So the difference here is we had talked about moving the large customer contracts over three years to four years. And so we had spread out that impact over a longer period of time than we're talking about now. But the overall impact is very similar to what we always expected and most of the impact is re-pricing - resetting the price for customer acquisition and for spot buy for large customers and given the mix of our business, the spot buy for large customers initially is actually probably the bigger impact, what is the bigger impact, but none of the total expectation of impact is changed at all.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning. Can you hear me?
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes, hello.
Robert McCarthy: Okay, yes. Okay, so two questions, one of substance and probably one of form the substance is first. I mean, could you talk about that your OpEx and operating structure and maybe thinking about your store footprint and your overall footprint in the context of what is a profoundly different changed in business model given these pricing actions?
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes, sure. So let me talk about the cost structure, maybe broadly. So on the branch issue, I think most people are familiar we've gone from [420 to 250] branches in the U.S. So we're relatively pleased with what we're actually seeing from the volume perspective in those remaining 250 branches and that's been a big shift from the recent past. The other thing to consider here is that these price changes are likely to have an impact on volume through those 250 branches, because a lot of those customers find sticker shock in our branches when they – especially small ones when they walk into them. So we want to watch that very closely, but we have a very well developed muscle for evaluating branch profitability. Overall, I would say that more of our volumes going to eCommerce, no question, winning based on eCommerce capabilities is absolutely critical. More of our volume is being shipped. Continuing to invest in our physical distribution capabilities outside of distribution center just important as a way to create competitive advantage and widen our competitive advantage. There is some changes we're making to areas like the contact centers where we are consolidating contact centers and lowering our cost in contact centers and to my point earlier, we are getting rid of cost, really in every part of the business. Our expectation is that we will get more productive in the sales force, more productive in the distribution centers, more productive in the branches, in headquarters, all of that needs to improve and that's going to be a big focus for us.
Robert McCarthy: The second question little tougher and I'm going to try to be prolific as I possibly can given the environment and what we're talking about here. But obviously DG, these are trends that we've seen with this change that are not particularly surprising, particularly for some investors and particularly for some bearers on Grainger. I guess you stepped into the new role of CEO, and kind of the October timeframe you have no opportunity to maybe address those concerns in November and kind of reset the bar for where we think pricing actions could take and maybe you get one swing at the back for kind of doing that. And now you're in a situation where you have to reduce guidance and at least near-term I think it's appropriate to say that management credibility you spend right in terms of the near-term operating environment and what you're seeing in terms of price. How are you going to restore that credibility over time and what should we think about in terms of your feel for how the business is going to go over the next 18 months? What’s the signpost can we look at to say that, how you feel the business is going to shakeout, bottom in 2018, going into 2019, what should we looking for to give us some confidence that what you've reset is kind of the appropriate trajectory?
Donald G. Macpherson: Right. So we are going to over communicate on what we're seeing from the changes we make. My expectation is that we will see the volume growth that we're talking about that will be a signpost, the expense to COGS will be a signpost and we'll talk a lot about what actions we're taking, what we're seeing from a productivity perspective. But I appreciate your comment and your question. The reality is that this is the biggest change and we had not changed enough prices yet in November to exactly know what was going to happen and it was improved at that point to talk about acceleration, we didn't know we are going to accelerate; now we do. It is a change I recognize that it's a difficult change, but we're going to basically track very closely what we're seeing from a volume, from an expense to COGS perspective, from a customer satisfaction perspective, from a customer acquisition perspective. The reality is we have not been able to acquire a customer into the Grainger brand for years and we are now going to start acquiring customers for the Grainger brand starting in the third quarter. And so that's a big shift for us and one that we're really excited about and we're confident we are going to get the results.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Adam Uhlman: Hi, good morning.
Donald G. Macpherson: Hi, Adam.
Adam Uhlman: Ron, I guess first on the gross margin guidance for the year, we started the first quarter, down 160 basis points. And then I guess we're expected to stay at that pace for the rest of the year, but the same time, pricing is expected to deteriorate. I guess what is the gross margin get worse as the year progresses?
Ronald Jadin: Couple of things. We expect that the COGS deflation will continue to be a partial offset and we've seen some favorable product mix. The interesting thing is that even though we've reduced the pricing on 450,000 SKUs and of course a million and a half of them by the middle of the year. We're seeing some nice volume lift on those products, still at GP rates that are above the Company average. So we take a big price hit upfront, but then we get that volume and that shows up in mix on those higher margin products. So that – we've seen some of that in the first quarter, we expect to see more of that as the year goes on.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. Gotcha. And then after you adjusted price on that, first 450,000 SKUs, could you help us out with the magnitude of the reductions that are planned for the remaining products set?
Ronald Jadin: In terms of SKU count, I’m not sure what your question is exactly.
Adam Uhlman: The size of the reduction and price across the remaining SKUs?
Ronald Jadin: So the $75 million is the price reduction for the acceleration in the third quarter of the remaining SKUs. So it's $75 million price reduction. We expect some volume response from that, which is about $35 million. So the net of those is kind of the topline. We'll get a little bit of a GP benefit, if you think of that $35 million at 40% adds another $15 million to margin to GP margin dollars. So the net at GP, we set at $60 million. So price write-down is $75 million, you get $15 million of it back in the short-term. Right, you don’t get it all back right away, so we set the GP dollar impact at $60 million and we're going to spend about $15 million in marketing across the board of these SKUs, so that we put that in there too.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hi, guys. Can you talk a little bit about – at your Analyst Day you said that this wouldn't be a race to the bottom. How are you thinking of the competitors in your space listening to these price actions, you know they are not really talking about this. And how do you guys discuss internally what you think the implications are of your pricing actions as it pertains to competitors and the race to the bottom?
Donald G. Macpherson: So we certainly don't. Our experience with prices that we change would suggest that we are absolutely not in a race to the bottom. When we have competitive prices and they're in the ballpark we are winning the business and it allows our customers to consolidate their purchases with us. So I’m not going to talk about specific competitors, I would say there are a lot of competitors in the online space who have competitive prices, some of which are growing, many of which are growing. So when we look at the entire competitive landscape for us and going forward, we feel like having competitive prices at least in the ballpark. This price is really, really important to be able to leverage the full suite of tools that we have to grow the business to create the customer experience we need. And so there's just so many different types of competitors out there in our space that I don't think you can sort of talk about one. The whole market, we have to understand and as we look at the whole market, we are going to have prices that are competitive that makes sense and it's going to enable us to acquire new customers and to grow the existing customers.
Andrew Buscaglia: I guess you just see yourself, I guess, as different from some of your competitors in terms of the actions you have to take. Is that correct? Or is that like your different end markets, I don't know what DC is like the main – you’re just getting there I guess…
Donald G. Macpherson: We're broader for one I guess than most of the competitors and I'm not sure who exactly you're talking about specifically, but certainly we are broader. I would also say that some of those competitors may not be talking about it, but they've already taken action in some of the things that they've done to try to mitigate it as well. So just depends - it depends who you're talking about, but we're confident in the decision we're making that it's the right thing to do. We are not going to have the lowest price. We're going to be competitive. We are going to be in the ballpark and it’s going to give us the opportunity to grow the business.
Ronald Jadin: I would just add, we've had a great opportunity to benchmark Zoro our own brand in the space. So we have great visibility obviously to that and it's helped us prepare better for what we're doing with our Grainger brand.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your questions.
Scott Graham: Hi, good morning.
Donald G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Scott Graham: Really, just two questions. How do you get comfortable with the pricing guidance for the year? Because we saw this really great volume response indicating success of the strategy in the first quarter. But obviously, much more disruptive to margins than you thought. And you've got more price actions coming. So kind of how do you bracket your full-year guidance of minus 4% on price, given what happened in the quarter? 
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes. Without getting into too many details, Scott, the good news as we know the impact of the list price change, the open web change, the changes that we've made and so we can quantify those. We would expect of course the second quarter to look similar to the first quarter in the sense that we're not making changes until the third quarter. And then the changes we make in the third quarter are similar to some of the changes we made in the first, so we're able to get reasonably comfortable with the range and that’s where that comes from.
Ronald Jadin: Yes. And if you thought about it in terms of price percent it's minus 4% for the U.S., minus 4% in the first and second quarter. It's minus 5% for the year, so implicitly it's minus 6% in each of the third and fourth quarter to DG’s point when we finished the web price changes in the third quarter.
Scott Graham: Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Ron, thank you. The other question I have is now you kind of advertised this now. So how do you guard against volume disruption between now and the third quarter?
Ronald Jadin: Well, I mean I think that, frankly, everybody who competes against us knew this was happening I would say anyway based on what we announced in November, so that's not new. We aren’t seeing competitive reaction that is unusual given our price changes. And so we've talked to all of our customers. We basically have a great conversation with our large customers. They're excited about the change we're on and the path we’re on, we think we're going to continue to gain volume. So we don't see anything that would suggest that the announcement is going to hurt volume in the short-term, we actually is going to help.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your questions.
Chris Dankert: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just trying to back into some of what you're talking about, it sounds like the Red Pass program go away entirely in the third quarter, since it doesn't sound, but shouldn’t be anymore opt again?
Donald G. Macpherson: So doesn't entirely go away and we'll provide more information as we go. Red Pass is the program that also includes a free freight component for customers that will stay and depending on the type of customer there may be specific pieces of the program that make sense to the different based on the segment. So it doesn't go away entirely certainly once we have open web, the price difference between Red Pass and what customers see will be very, very small. So that is a big difference.
Robert McCarthy: Okay, thanks. And then I guess perhaps on [indiscernible], I guess looking at 2017 margin guidance and then kind of your implicit 2018 numbers for EBIT margin, but it's just like 300 basis point recovery in the 2019 to kind of get to the mid-range your target, I guess what gives you confidence and be able to drive that kind of leverage. We have seen in the model to quite a degree in the past?
Ronald Jadin: Probably half of that is cost leverage, some of it's structural in nature, some of it is volume leverage because we anticipate driving volume that's going to be up in the mid-to-high single-digits feel like that was a long time ago, but that wasn't that long ago and our pricing or to put it back in that range. So that's probably least half of it. And the other half is some of the mix and volume that we're going to get from higher margin customers, DG mentioned before, it's been a decade, we always talk about negative mix with growth – faster growth of large customers, we should be talking a little bit differently by 2000, even some of that in 2018, but for sure in 2019 overall.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. Just so the acceleration seems clearly response to market and probably what's emerged over the past couple years is a little bit more parity on the service and supply chain edge that you've enjoyed historically. So just wondering where you draw the comfort that what you're describing in the body of your pricing actions. Actually has, as defined of terminus as is implied in the multi-year outlook?
Donald G. Macpherson: So Christy, I would say couple of things. First of all, when we track 20 competitors on customer service metrics and on their perceptions of us, I would not actually say that our service advantage has been diminished. I would actually say we are stronger now than we've been in the 10-year that I've been with the Company on that dimension. The ability to get complete orders to customers quickly, the ability to provide great experience on the web side, on eCommerce channels and our sales force and service model with large complex customers get very, very high marks and actually higher than they've gotten historically. So I would necessarily say that's true. In terms of terminus, we're confident that we're in the ballpark from a pricing perspective. We're going to be able to grow the business. We've done a lot of work to understand what those price points are. We've analyzed it, as you might guess quite a bit. And so we're pretty comfortable that that we're going to be in a place to expand margins, operating margins, assuming we continue to get the cost leverage we've gotten. We will continue to do that, but we're pretty confident the price points were likely to end at that.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, thanks for that. And then could you just clarify crystallize again just what the difference in substances, when you talk about web pricing versus list pricing?
Ronald Jadin: Well, historically for us list price has been web price, because the list price has been what's been on the web side. When we talked about open web, the complexity right now is that if you go online and you try to buy something and it's a SKU that we have an open web price on, you will see the list price and you will see the web price and you will have the option to opt-in to that web price. When we remove by the end of this year, in the third quarter we will put everything on web price. We will not have a need to show our list price right at that point. So they will again be one in the same, but only at a new level.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Duncan with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.
Matt Duncan: Hey, good morning guys. So DG one of the things I think you've been hitting at is that there's been some price increase, maybe even on certain product categories. So I’m trying to get a sense sort of where you're having the cut price the most and what categories you're still seeing sort of stronger pricing, where were you priced appropriately and where would you off?
Donald G. Macpherson: So from a list price perspective, when we made the changes January 1 about two-thirds of the price has changed. There were more down than up’s at that time, but there certainly were items where we were not priced high enough and we made those decisions as well. We feel like the web – we've obviously done a lot of work already to know where web price needs to be. There are some items that we were just priced incorrectly. But in general, we will be more competitive and we will be in the ballpark and that's the strategy that we have.
Matt Duncan: Can you talk all about product categories are you just trying to stay away from that? 
Donald G. Macpherson: Well, it's less typically around product categories than SKUs within categories actually where we will see the changes that we had to make. So they weren't broad categories that we had to lower a bunch or increase a bunch in general and most of it was actually within the category where the numbers were interesting.
Matt Duncan: Okay. And then the second question I've got is just around the 2018 profitability. I'm trying to make sure I understand all the stepping stones here. So if U.S. gross margin is down 120 basis points, what is happening with total Company gross margins? Are you expecting a fairly good level of SG&A leverage next year such that by the time we get the operating margin in 2018? Is it down versus 2017 or is 2018 kind of the same and then you get the big jump in the 2019 with volume? Just trying to make sure we understand the step function here?
Ronald Jadin: Yes. We should see higher operating margin in 2018 for the Company, then we do in 2017 and certainly some of that will come from the cost side, the volume leverage, as well as structural changes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Belfiore with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
Christopher Belfiore: Good morning, guys. How are you doing?
Donald G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Ronald Jadin: Great.
Christopher Belfiore: So I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit more about the 40% or like the spot buy that you guys pointed out in November of the large customer. In terms of that, I know you said it improve all the pricing measures, but is there like a certain group of those customers that you guys saw like heavy manufacturing or specific kind of category that kind of came back and then do you think there is – do you see like other groups that maybe didn't see the prices, didn't kind of react to the pricing, are they going to come back later or is there any dynamic that you kind of share?
Donald G. Macpherson: So we've set the new pricing for fairly broad swaths of customers and we have not seen anything particularly interesting by customer end market. So we haven't seen differences for manufacturing, healthcare or commercial at this point. We have not seen big differences in terms of the reaction.
Christopher Belfiore: Okay. And then I guess just kind of maybe change things up a little bit, a lot of our U.S. pricing. In Canada you guys noted that there is – the freighting was an issue in terms of freighting cost from the direct-to-customer kind of shift. Where you guys in terms of percentage of that kind of shift right now and I think you mentioned in November or is that basically once you hit kind of around 70% direct-to-customers, when you kind of neutralize the effect of the higher freighting cost, kind of just an idea where you guys are in that process?
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes. And we are going to talk a lot more about Canada over the next couple of months, but they're over 50% direct-to-customer today and given the ERP change, there is still some fairly inefficient things that are happening to serve customers today. We will improve that over the next six months, so we've got a lot of room to improve and we still feel like 70% probably where we're going to end up in terms of direct-to-customer in Canada. That stills a fairly reasonable number for us.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, I just want to go back to a couple of questions that we got on competitive pricing dynamics. And DG, back in November at the analyst meeting, you shared the assumption that you thought price competition somehow levels off next year. So people have asked this question here, but maybe just to come back to it. What do you think the competitive response is, as you cut cost – cut pricing, why aren't you also assuming that there will be a competitive response here and this does turn into another race to the bottom?
Donald G. Macpherson: Well, I would say primarily because for large our complex customers, they have competitive prices already. What we're doing is trying to give reasonable prices in the spot buy and that is unlikely to drive significant competitive response when you do that that’s really the way we're thinking about this. The other thing is we just look at prices and what's happened with pricing in the market over time. Our need to reset price is not really based on competitive changes in the marketplace, it's really based on our own pricing and what our customers are asking for and how they buy. So we don't see the market racing to the bottom in general and we really haven't seen that over the last few years.
Deane Dray: Okay. And then second question, also outside of the U.S. I was hoping you could comment on the UK business, Cromwell. And I know you've kind of avoid commenting on specific customers, but you did have a very – competitors. But you do have a very big competitor that Amazon this month launched their UK business as a direct competition to Cromwell. So update on Cromwell and competitive dynamics there, please.
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes. So competitive dynamics, we are pleased with what we're seeing out of that business. We started the Cromwell direct business. Part of the thesis for buying that business was they had the supply chain and product range that allowed us to build the online model. We're seeing very nice growth with that portion of it. Currency and Brexit has had an impact on the UK economy, but the business is actually performing quite well. I would say Europe generally favor. We actually saw some decent growth in the first quarter as well. So really the entire international portfolio right now I'd say we feel like there is lots of opportunity to grow and grow margins and so in the UK we're happy with our position right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] filling in for Hamzah. I have a question for you guys around inventory levels. Do you guys think they are where they need to be given the current demand environment and what’s your outlook?
Donald G. Macpherson: So we manage inventories to service level expectations generally and so we are very good service levels right now in the U.S. and in most of our businesses. So in general, we're pretty happy with our inventory levels. Obviously, as you grow the business you have to add some inventory. Typically we get some productivity out of the inventory pool and don't have to add as much inventory as the growth requires. So I think we're still in that situation. Ron do you have anything to add?
Ronald Jadin: Yes, our inventory turns, our working capital turns have been very constant for quite some time, so we would expect those to continue that way. I had given a comment earlier about GP rate decline on Slide 12, which was the pie chart slide, and it mentions on the far right, the U.S. segment declining 120 basis points. For the Company it's difficult to give guidance for 2018 at this point, but certainly we would expect the Company to move in a similar direction to the U.S. So I'd expect it to be down 120 basis points for the Company as well and then it depends on what happens in the other parts of the business, but we should expect to see that kind of a decline in 2018. So I hope that answers that question. I guess I commented mostly on the U.S. and not the Company at the time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions.
Robert Barry: Hey, guys, good morning.
Donald G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Robert Barry: I hope you're not already having any regrets about doing these calls. I think on a day like today actually it's particularly useful. So just back to the kind of price volume trade-off, would you expect to turn into a net benefit. It sounds like you expect a lagged effect of price cuts to see the volume response maybe also a larger mix response growing over time in reaction to kind of the given price cuts you're making today, is that right? And why would it kind of grow over time without cutting price more?
Donald G. Macpherson: Right. Yes. That's right. That's our expectation. So in any period that's a fairly narrow period of time, if you reduce price, you will not get the volume back right away. Customers have to realize and particularly customers have to realize that our prices are now more reasonable in order for them to start buying with some frequency. So we've done a number of trials over the last three years to get comfortable with this, both with smaller customers – midsized customers through Red Pass, large customers by contract negotiations in every one of those when you change price right away, you don't get enough volume to make up for, but over time, it's actually quite attractive. So that gives us a lot of confidence in the path we’re heading now.
Robert Barry: Gotcha and there was an expectation I know at the Analyst Day that part of the response was that customers would not only raise the volume with Grainger, but kind of mix up into higher margin categories. I mean is that happening and also why would that necessarily have been?
Donald G. Macpherson: Well, so I think it's best to talk about large complex customers on that dimension. So large complex customers often have contracts, they might have specific items that are in the contract, they might have categories that are in the contract, but they also have a discount off of list for their slow moving items. When we talk about mix, one of the things we're trying to do is to make sure that we are attractive for the entire bundle and the entire bundle would includes slow moving items and those would be better than the average margin for us, but also very attractive prices for them because those items very frequently. So we're trying to make the price structure makes sense, so that we can consolidate the entire purchasing for customers and we find customers respond very, very when we get there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions.
Evelyn Chow: Hi, good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chow in for Joe.
Donald G. Macpherson: Hi.
Evelyn Chow: You've taken a lot of very proactive actions on pricing in 2017. But there is also a lot of moving parts, so maybe you can help us understand when you think about your various initiatives that you’re targeting in 2017 and 2018? What would you consider as the lower hanging fruit versus what you believe will take more considered effort to drive?
Donald G. Macpherson: Well, I don't know that there's really any – I mean with the changes complex in this challenge. I wouldn't say there's any lower hanging fruit necessarily. I would say that we are – we have built muscles around two areas that I think we are going to be very exciting for us. One is, when we get the price that right with large customers driving that volume. Our sales and service model with large complex customers is very effective. The other is our digital capabilities and when we get prices that are reasonable and we can start marketing those prices digitally that's going to help drive volume and we're very confident about that too. So those are two things that we're doing that I think is going to be very, very helpful to driving growth into the business and so we're going to track our performance against those two very, very closely to make sure that the price strategy translates into growth and translates into the customer experience and in the margin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Bergner: Good morning, DG. Good morning, Ron.
Donald G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Ronald Jadin: Good morning.
Justin Bergner: I want to start by asking for your 2019 margin guidance, are you assuming a lower gross margin for 2019 than you were assuming at the Investor Day, offset by lower SG&A or how does the margin component sort of line up in 2019 versus what you laid out in November?
Donald G. Macpherson: It's not that different, I think even we had that in Q&A, if I remember in November. We talked about kind of GP being in that for the Company that 39% range, falling below 40%, but not below 39%, probably falls below 39% next year and then bounces back in 2019. As the mix in the volume benefit from mix outweighs the pricing changes, which we kind of lap as we exit 2018.
Justin Bergner: Okay. And then the second pricing question just relates to relative to the November investor event, it seem like that focus was more on the non-contract business. So is it essentially most of the incremental price impact coming from that $2 billion of less competitive contract business now being fast forwarded into one-year versus four?
Donald G. Macpherson: That's exactly, that's the right way to think about it. So we are being much more aggressive, much faster in terms of getting the prices reset on that volume.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions.
Karen Lau: Hi, good morning. It’s Karen Lau dialing in for John.
Donald G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Karen Lau: Good morning. Just curious on how much of the volume, which you say is kind locked in within contracts because when you think about competitive response, especially on the spot market, you're now pricing more competitively, but your competitors can also come back and be even more competitive. So I’m just trying to get a sense of how much of the incremental volumes that you have baked in are coming from contract volume where the accounts are kind of locked in and so once you get the incremental product purchases they are sort of more guarantees to come through in 2018 and 2019?
Donald G. Macpherson: So, if I understand your question correctly, I would say that the volume growth is a mix of getting that spot buy volume with large customers and acquiring new mid-size customers and penetrating them and we think we're going to get volume out of both. I would say that our experience with the online model would suggest both of those are actually pretty sticky when you've got a strong supply chain, you provide great service. So our expectation is that we'll be able to get growth both through our large contracts and through new customer acquisition with the changes we're making.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Donald G. Macpherson: Good morning.
Nigel Coe: Ron maybe we've talked about the gross margin which in part, I just wonder could you maybe just reconcile what control perhaps the price decline, I think you’ve got four points of price down, I think 50 bps of COGS deflation. So the remaining, I guess it's from 160 down, so the remaining 150 how does that split between cost reductions through bookings?
Ronald Jadin: I’m sorry, which period that you’re asking about?
Nigel Coe: Sorry, this is FY2017.
Ronald Jadin: 2017, so there is the price decline, favorable mix is probably one of the biggest offsets that's helping us this year. From a GP perspective, when you think about a 4% price decline this year, that's about $400 million a price. The impact on that for GP is maybe 2.5% right when you do it on a GP basis. There's a fair amount of volume though rate that we're driving just in general at prior year GP rates, so volume component is pretty sizable. And then the cost deflation, you mentioned and then the favorable mix really helps, so if you think about the pricing impact that’s $400 million driving about 2.5% negative, we're down a little bit less than that for the Company overall in our guidance and it's because of that deflation and mix partially offsetting. So we end up down about 160 basis points for the Company on GP rate and similar for our margin rate, maybe 10 basis points or so of cost leverage.
Donald G. Macpherson: Yes, I would say – yes, I’d also add that the cost leverage is in a world where you have that much price decline. We are getting significant cost leverage on an activity basis on a COGS basis, but it's a challenge obviously when you have that much price deflation.
Ronald Jadin: Yes. That 10 basis points was a percent of sales not a percent of COGS. Percent of COGS would be a much bigger improvement.
Nigel Coe: And then just on the favorable mix impacts, when you've taken pricing actions of this magnitude the profitable mid-tier customer and the spot purchases from the large customers, does that still increment 40% plus or is it more like a 30% type of volume impact?
Ronald Jadin: It's higher. Yes, it’s 40% plus, yes. End of Q&A
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. DG Macpherson for closing comments.
Donald G. Macpherson: So thanks everyone for joining the call. Obviously it was a challenging quarter. I just want to conclude by saying that we are facing into the challenges we have, we're facing into them with that the information that we have now and we are confident this is the right thing to do for the long-term health of the Company. We obviously wouldn't be taking these actions if we didn't think they are right for our customers and for creating value over the long haul. And so it's difficult. There is no question about that, but we are aligned as a team, we are fully committed to making this work to driving the volume growth and to getting the margins back to where they need to be. So appreciate your time today and we'll see you soon. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greeting and welcome to the W.W. Grainger fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Laura Brown, Senior Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you Ms. Brown, you may now begin.
Laura Brown: Good morning, everyone. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us this morning. With me is DG Macpherson, Grainger's CEO and Ron Jadin, Grainger's CFO. Earlier this morning, we reported our results for the 2016 fourth quarter and full-year. Included in today's press release were several large adjustments. We would like to take this opportunity to discuss these adjustments in further detail and that's the reason we decided to host a live call this quarter. As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking, based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties including those detailed in our SEC filings. These documents are available on our Investor Relations website together with reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures. DG will begin by making some opening comments regarding the performance of the business as well as provide additional cover on a couple of the adjustments. He will then turn the call over to Ron to discuss the remaining adjustments. After closing remarks, we'll open the call for question. DG, to you.
DG Macpherson: Thank you, Laura. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Even though our underlying operations performed is expected, given the number and the size of several fourth quarter adjustments, I thought the need to discuss them more in open detail. As Laura mentioned, Ron will cover several of the accounting adjustments as well but before we do that, I would like to share my thoughts on the performance of the business for the quarter. The fourth quarter was operationally in line with the expectations we shared in November at our Analyst Day, both from a sales and an earnings perspective. Our US business performed slightly better than expected given stronger sales performance in December in solid expense management. Our business in Canada was still underperforming is making progress and also met our expectations for the quarter with better than expected sales performance in the month of December. Both the US and Canada exceeded our sales expectation in the month of December, which we partially attribute to the favorable timing of the year and holidays and some customer year-end spending. Our single channel online business is primarily Zoro in the US and MonotaRO in Japan, continued to perform quite well, growing revenue and earning strongly in the quarter. So far, in January we're seeing some softness which we believe is related to extend the vacations that occurred in early January due to the timing of the New Year's holiday. In addition, January has a touch count both in the US and Canada. And in Canada, especially why that's some prebind that occurred prior to the new system implementation of February 1st last year. Now, this past year, we made strong progress towards positioning the business for better growth and performance in the future. Several examples include further realignment of the large customer Salesforce to focus on specific end markets. The launch of our inside sales team focused on medium-sized customers, the opening of our 1.4 million square foot new DC in the North East. We made significant progress on e-commerce both with our www.grainger.com and online model with the customer experience. We continued previously announced restructuring in the US and Canada including the closure of 69 branches, and we also initiated new pricing in the US which provide a more relevant price for new and noncontract customers across all channels including the web. Now, with that overview of the quarters of backdrop, I would like to now cover two of the adjustments that we reported today. First, our decision to write down a portion roughly half of the goodwill associated with the Fabory business; which was acquired in August of 2011. The impact EPS was $0.79. For those of you not familiar with Fabory, it is a fastener specials primarily focused in the Netherlands and Belgium. We have restructured this business on several occasions and we are seeing improved revenue and stable margins resulting from the current initiatives. And while we believe that business has potential for growth in the future. Our historical weak growth in margin performance caused us to revalue the long-term goodwill. Secondly, we took at $0.08 EPS impairment charge for some intangible assets related to our business in Columbia. Both Fabory and Columbia are fastener specials and outside of our broad line MRO portfolio. We have been taking action in the last couple of years to make sure that we focus on our core broad line MRO markets in developed economies. So, with that I would like to turn it over to Ron to discuss the remaining adjustments.
Ronald Jadin: Thank, DG. As we shared in this morning's release, we recognize the $36 million or $0.38 per share charge related to an accounting adjustment for unclaimed property. For Grainger, unclaimed property is debt is defined primarily as aged customer debits and credits. Prior to 2013, the unclaimed property was recognized as income and no liability was established. The adjustment made in the fourth quarter reflects our best estimate of any unclaimed property prior to 2013. This issue was identified internally and the estimate has been validated by external third parties. In 2013, we implemented a new process and began establishing liability for unclaimed property. In addition, we recorded $9 million or a $0.10 per share charge to increase the reserve for contract dispute. We've been working with the General Services Administration or GSA, auditors to resolve these issues from an ongoing audit. These issues related to tax rate and miscellaneous billing errors, this dispute relates to sales under a multi-award contract beginning in 1999. The GSA continues to be a great customer. We have done more than $2 billion in business with them since the beginning of the contract in 1999. In addition, there were several small discrete tax items recorded in the quarter, the true up estimated tax is versus taxes paid, primarily for US federal and state tax provisions. Combined these at a negative $0.06 EPS impact, partially offsetting $0.21 in EPS favorability recorded in earlier quarters from the settlement of tax returns for the years 2009 to 2012. Now, I'll turn it back to DG for closing comments.
DG Macpherson: Thanks, Ron. Well, I'm certainly not pleased with the need to make these adjustments in 2016. The underlying business generally met our expectations. As a result, we reiterated our sales in EPS guidance for 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we made significant changes to the business over the last year and I am excited about the future prospects for growth and profitability for the business. We are focused on our core businesses in North America, the online model in the UK. We generated $1 billion in cash flow at 2017. We expect to see free cash flow continue to grow as we will not need to spend as much in the coming years on capital expenditures as we have in the recent past. So, with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ryan Merkel: Hey, good morning guys, and congrats on being the quarter.
DG Macpherson: Thank you.
Ryan Merkel: So, first question from me is why are you reducing gross margins for the year and then secondly related, you also mentioned that Apex is tracking a little bit lower and you're changing that. So, what's underlying those two things?
DG: Yeah, go ahead, Ron.
Macpherson: Yeah, go ahead, Ron.
Ronald Jadin: Sure. Ryan, it's really early to make a call on guidance for the year based on where we ended the fourth quarter really being right on our guidance. As we thought about it, our favorability in expenses we thought we should reflect slightly but we didn’t want to change the overall, so it's just kind of at really at the front, just a minor tweak for recognize a little bit of favorability and a little bit of risk on either expense or GP. But I wouldn’t read really probably we shouldn’t have changed anything in line side, it was such a small change and we really don’t know any more about the year, now then when we set it November.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, so nothing really that dramatic change with the gross margin?
Ronald Jadin: No. We don’t intend any real signaling there.
Ryan Merkel: Okay, got it, okay.
Ronald Jadin: I mean, 10 basis points is pretty small.
Ryan Merkel: Got it, okay. And then secondly, on pricing. Our suppliers starting to talk about price increases and then you delay the price increase in Canada but remind us when you plan to push that through.
DG Macpherson: Sure, Ryan. So, we are constantly in communication with our suppliers on price increases from our supplier community. We had some pressure in some categories but overall the pressure's been relatively modest and we don’t expect to have significant price increases throughout this year. So, we're expecting it to be relatively stable on that front. In terms of Canada, as we went through the transition with the system last year, given some of the service challenges we did not pass through a price increase that otherwise we would have been passing through last year. We have started that process now and through the first half of the year, we will be increasing prices in Canada to reflect the market.
Ryan Merkel: Perfect. And just one last follow-up. I'm a little surprised to hear you say you're not expecting suppliers to raise prices. Just given what we've seen with the commodities, so is there something else that is that demand's not strong enough or you're just not having the negotiations right now that tell you or give you enough confidence that you would see suppliers rating price.
DG: Right. So, given what we see and there is always a lag for us. So, in terms of the commodities increasing, it takes a while for that to flow through the supplier base. At some point of commodity stay at elevator levels for a longer period of time, we typically will see some supplier cost increases and we will then pass those through. But it hasn’t been long enough yet to really force that to happen.
Macpherson: Right. So, given what we see and there is always a lag for us. So, in terms of the commodities increasing, it takes a while for that to flow through the supplier base. At some point of commodity stay at elevator levels for a longer period of time, we typically will see some supplier cost increases and we will then pass those through. But it hasn’t been long enough yet to really force that to happen.
Ryan Merkel: Got it. Okay, thank you so much.
DG: Thank you.
Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from David Manthey of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
David Manthey: Thanks. Hi guys, good morning. First off, could you talk a little bit more about the unclaimed property continue to, not sure I fully understand that. Could you give us more details on what the impact was historically because of how it was being handled and what it means going forward as well?
DG Macpherson: I'll turn that over to Ron.
Ronald Jadin: Sure. So, the $36 million reserve covers, I think we highlighted in there but $2 million or $3 million for potential interest cost, that sort of things, but roughly the $33 million or so related to that is over a five year period. So, it's about $6 million or so a year. And these are amounts owed to probably nearly 170,000 to 200,000 customers in amounts that are typically less than $200 a piece, somewhere adjustments on freight and tax. There is a variety of different debits and credits that can be issued by Grainger to a customer. And in those years, prior to 2013, after they aged significantly and were not applied, were taken to income by the company. And we should have put a liability on the books for that prior to 2013, actually in 2013 and we didn’t do till now.
David Manthey: Okay. So, it's not that it increased anything, it just didn’t decrease whether its sales or cost as it should, is that what you're saying?
Ronald Jadin: I'm not sure I understand our question there.
David Manthey: Well, if it were something that you had owed to a customer but you didn’t take through the P&L, the sales or your profitability was inflated historically now you're just recognizing that, so bringing that down, is that how I should think about it?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. We recognize it to the P&L up through 2012. So, we took those --
David Manthey: And not?
Ronald Jadin: And not since then, no.
David Manthey: Not since then, right.
Ronald Jadin: So, everything's, we are really just reflecting now the same process we've been going through since 2013, we're reflecting that back into prior years.
David Manthey: Okay. And then second on pricing, if you can talk a little about the Red Pass Plus sort of the uptake there? How are you driving awareness and then as it relates to the pricing dynamic here, whether or not you are getting price increases or the cost side of your equation is changing. Are you still targeting a minus 1% price in 2017?
Ronald Jadin: Yes. We have no change to our expectation at this point for pricing for the year. Red Pass Plus for those unfamiliar, it's a program for typically for mid-sized customers. Most of that activation has happened historically the last nine months through inside sales and it's been a program we've used to get reasonable prices for those customers. That had continued to accelerate that program. We're also offering it now online for the first time. And we're also seeing some sign ups online. So, we would expect that to continue to be a key part of getting reasonable prices for all of our mid-sized customers both online and through our inside sales organization and we're seeing really good results when we get customers to sign under that program thus far.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone. I guess the first question is, is this going to be a conference call that you're going to have every quarter, is this just because of the nature of the charges and what's going on. Is this a one off?
Ronald Jadin: So, we will continue to evaluate our investor outreach and we will continue to talk about it. At this point this is a one off because if that changes we will certainly let you know.
Robert McCarthy: Alright, not to be cynical but obviously CEO's in the past when they get into the seat, obviously if taken rather large sizable charges going forward, now obviously this is a long standing issue, so I understand that. But do you think that you could have done more in terms of perhaps calling out some more restructuring on your branch base footprint or do you think it that just do more of that consistent with your kind of message that you are sort of viewing that organically as you go forward?
DG Macpherson: Let me try to understand the question. So, on the branch organization, is that what you are asking?
Robert McCarthy: The branch history, perhaps this could have been an opportunity while you had all these items to perhaps do some more maybe one time issues in association with branch consolidation or restructuring.
DG Macpherson: Yeah, sure. So, we now have a little 252 branches in the US. I'll focus in the US for this discussion. We've gone from 420 to 250. We've actually seen stability and even some growth in branches with those existing buildings and the volume that goes through them is quite profitable. So, we will always evaluate the branch and the branch footprint but right now we like what we are seeing out of the branches that remain open. And so, we right now wouldn't make sense for us to take any additional restructuring given what we're seeing in terms of volume into those branches.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. And then this question is a bit of a stretch but I guess that’s what I'm known for. In terms of the oil and gas and energy exposure in Canada, I think that broadly could be anywhere from 15% to 20% of the overall company. Could you talk about kind of what you are seeing both explicit energy exposure, the knock-on impact the Canadian effect and what you -- could we see the prospect for a recovery kind of going into '18 or '19 or what are you looking for to get a better sense of maybe we could start to see a return to positive growth across the sizable kind of end market perspective of your company.
Ronald Jadin: Yes. So, oil and gas for Canada I think as you are familiar with, the direct exposure is high, the indirect is probably 30% plus I would say in terms of resources and just Alberta and what you see, what we have seen is the knock-on effects for oil and gas on construction companies in Alberta. So, it's the big portion of the revenue in Canada. It's much less in the US, in US it's less than 5%. So, that said, we are watching very closely. You can look at oil recounts, obviously they've gone up recently, we're also talking with lot of our large customers about project business. Certainly things are stabilized with that customer base. They are not taking capacity out, this time last year they were taking 10s of 1000s of people out of the operation. Right now that's not happened. We don't see great activity yet but certainly I would expect it could to your time line '18, '19, we certainly could see a turnaround there. That's very possible if oil stays between 50 and 100.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. Could you touch briefly on your US exposure excluding Canada with respect to oil and gas direct and indirect and what you are seeing there?
Ronald Jadin: US, for oil and gas.
DG Macpherson: Oh, for oil and gas. Question into direct is, US of oil and gas direct is 2 arguably oil and gas has a fairly significant impact on heavy manufacturing so I don't know that we fully know but I would say organizations that produce large machinery, given oil and gas have been very affected by that and so we have seen that heavy manufacturing getting hit in the US as a result probably less than 10% of our total US business and that probably is stabilizing now as well.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ryan Cieslak of Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ryan Cieslak: Hi, good morning guys.
DG Macpherson: Good morning.
Ronald Jadin: Good morning.
Ryan Cieslak: The first question is on just the gross margin guidance for the first quarter. It downed 80 to 130 basis points or so. That implies sequentially maybe the trends from the fourth to the first blow in you but normal trend we've seen on a sequential basis. Is there anything going into the first quarter that might be impacting the gross margin or something that maybe was unusual in the fourth quarter that's rolling off.
DG Macpherson: Probably just Canada, the timing of the recovery and margins in Canada like DG said it's going to the pricing actions are going to be over the first six months and so that's going to ramp up over a longer period of time than you'd expect to see in the US from a pricing perspective.
Ryan Cieslak: Okay and then the pricing then on in Canada, you mentioned that the price increase coming through, is that something that just gradually rolls through in the first half of the year or is there a specific date you guys would be implementing that, that price increase?
Ronald Jadin: We've already started the process. It hits a relatively small portion of the volume initially because you have to go through customer level negotiations to get a broader increase and so that's the process we have to follow through the first six months.
Ryan Cieslak: Okay. And then my follow-up question and I will jump back in the queue when you look at the end market breakout in the month of December, real nice take up in commercial and government and then you also highlighted heavy manufacturing as positive. Was there anything in particular within those end markets that you really saw in the month that gives you greater confidence? Is that sustainable or is that just a combination of maybe some easier comps and some other things? Thanks.
Ronald Jadin: Yeah, I'm going to take. So, in December everything was up and part of that's a holiday timing, part of that was some year-end buying. From an end market perspective we are seeing certainly manufacturing stabilize even through the entire fourth quarter and then government has been strong and consistent strong performer and we feel like we're well-positioned to continue to grow the government business.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
DG Macpherson: Good morning.
Ronald Jadin: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Hi. I was hoping to follow-up on that last point on the strengthening the government business in the fourth quarter and it's the term that you say was project business and I was associate Grainger with more MRO type business stuff that wears out or has to be replaced and less about project. So, maybe if you just clarify when you talk about the government projects what type of business is that?
DG Macpherson: Yeah. So, that it would be more small projects rather than large projects, Deane. It would still be MRO but if people are doing maintenance cleanup projects in a bigger way, sometimes will have somewhat larger orders. The order pattern had some of that but it wasn't tremendously high volume. Generally the volume was good across the broad in December and so I wouldn't read too much into the project business. I think the government flow has been very, very consistent, we continue to do very well, the military with federal government and we saw some state government strength as well.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then, for pricing in Canada down 4% points, was that across the board or was it mostly energy and natural resource focused?
DG Macpherson: It is across the board, although the bigger head is in the energy and resource business given where volume is and that's been more challenged throughout the entire year last year. I would say that's true.
Deane Dray: And then just last question from me if I could, maybe for Ron, really strong free cash flow conversion this quarter anything unusual in terms of timing of payments or anything like that?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. There was actually with regard to timing of payables, just there was a lot of inventory purchase near the end of the year, so our in transit inventory balance increased quite a bit and as a result our payable did as well. So, really just the timing thing there. Most of our favorability was driven by working capital. AR came down quite a bit in the fourth quarter versus the third which it always does but even more so this year and I think the timing, this time the time when holiday helped us in terms of when the holidays on a weekend we have more days to collect where our customers are open and we are in the office. So AR benefited as well.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then, just lastly a comment that the extent to which voice of the customer matters and like Robert McCarthy's question, it'd be great if you guys would get consideration to do any of these calls. I think it's gone very well and we appreciate the insight. Thank you.
DG Macpherson: Thank you, Deane.
Ronald Jadin: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hey guys. Can you just talk a little bit about your Canada segment? I would have thoughts thing could will get a little better in Q4 but you got something going on there. How much, what's the trajectory of that business on the operating line through the year like, will we see a break even number by the end of '17?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. We are -- our plan calls for fourth quarter to break even with the business in Canada. Just to give you a little bit history there, given the reliance on oil and gas, obviously the down turn has a big impact and the added challenge has been, we put the new system in and we had some service disruptions as well. We focused very hard last half of the year on stabilizing the service and we are hearing very good things from customers right now in terms of providing service to them and so we feel like we are in a better position now to be able to do things like take price increases and drive volume but we would expect to be break even in the fourth quarter of next year of this year.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay, got it. Then just one other sort of a question on the EBIT line in your unallocated expenses. Looks like you're helped by some restructuring there. How come some, what was that restructuring specifically help that line item or like why would that go into that specific?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. There was some cost, we have easier comps in the fourth quarter of this year than last year because in the fourth quarter of '15 we had quite a few expenditures relative to the SAP project which went live in the first quarter of '16. So, from an expense perspective if that's what you are referring to we had easier comps but we also were taking cost out of the business as well as we've been doing everywhere, given the soft revenue.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. So, that's the expense that helps you, looks like it helps you about $0.09 or so for --.
Ronald Jadin: Are you looking at the adjustments page?
Andrew Buscaglia: Yeah.
Ronald Jadin: Oh, the adjustment. That had to do earlier this year. That wasn’t a fourth quarter item.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay.
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. Earlier in the year just to be clear, I was answering fourth quarter.
Andrew Buscaglia: Well, I was just looking at your unallocated expenses usually is a little bit higher in Q4 but for some reason this quarter it seemed like it helped your EBIT line.
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. And I think I answered it, yeah. Easier comps.
DG Macpherson: This is an implication at the moment.
Ronald Jadin: It's really easier comps.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay, got it. Alright, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Hi, good morning and thanks for having this call. I just wanted to really understand a little bit a more about the price decreases that you are putting through for the mid-size customers and also the spot buys latter being discussed a lot at the Investor Meeting back in November. And the simple question is this since you indicated that at that time that you had begun that price reduction program or whatever you like to call it initiative it was about 18 months ago. So, just kind of hoping you can tell us how is that going for both, I mean how are the mid-size customer reacting, how are the sort of across the board if selective stock price reductions to various customers going on spot buys? Could you give us an idea of how that is going, are you starting to see those sales respond?
Ronald Jadin: So, I would make a few points. Thanks for the question. So, with our large customers they have had competitive prices for a long time. We had changed to some degree our price structure to try to give them more price incentives to buy slower moving items. And that has gone reasonably well when we give category discounts or other discounts we do see volume increases. So, that has gone well. On the mid-size customer piece, we went through a fairly significant coverage change last year where we eliminated outside sales covering mid-size customers and started inside sales and that team has been working to get the pricing programs in place for those customers and again when we get to customers and we get them to sign up with the pricing program which we talked about Red Pass Plus a minute ago, that has gone well. The broad changes on the web have just started. So when we talked in November we talked about the beginning of the year starting those changes. It's too early to say how they are going and really what we've done so far is changed some prices to understand how the back-end systems would work and support those changes and so far that looks good. You'll see a lot more that happening over the next couple of months and we are getting a much better read on how on the impact of those changes and just to remind everybody the goal here is to provide a reasonable price for small mid-size customers and spot buys. And that price will be higher GP than the average GP. So it's still going to be not cheap but it's a reasonable price for those customers and those changes broadly are just starting now.
Scott Graham: Excellent. Just one other question if I could you know. Your sales guidance for the year was +2 to +6 was given at time when let's just say optimism was not where it is today I think there is clearly a lot more optimism in the business community particularly in industrial land. I was just sort of wondering if you would be able to give us a opinion, I know it's only the first quarter but I suspect the +2 would be a little bit disappointing in that, somewhere within that range we are kind of thinking more at least the mid-point. Is there anything you could offer DG on kind of what you are thinking now on that sales guidance range versus two months ago given the changes that has taken place?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. I mean, I don't know that we've got a different perspective. I would say to your point around optimism, I have been with a number of customers this year and there is some optimism but that optimism hasn't yet translated into to activity. And in fact, some of the manufacturers had some concerns as well as optimism about the rush in things to do. So, I would say there is some optimism and if that were to bear fruit, certainly that would help us. So far we haven't seen it. So, I don't think our position has changed at all.
Scott Graham: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
Adam Uhlman: Hi, good morning. Thanks again for hosting the call.
DG Macpherson: Good morning.
Adam Uhlman: Just a follow-up on that last question. And then, I guess as this optimism has been building. At what point would the company think about adding additional growth spending to the forecast for the year. Will we have to be above the high end of the sales guidance or do you think you are pretty well set in terms of the additions that you planned for sales people, regardless of the demand environment?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. I think we are mostly set, I think with the large customer organization we are mostly set in terms of the coverage we have. We like the coverage we have and that group is going to get more productive given some of the tools we've given to them. I would say for mid-size customers what would get us to increase spending is if the results were positive in a way that was better than we expected, then we would spend the money. And so, I don't think it's necessarily external. It's more what happens to our own initiatives and if the initiatives bear fruit we will spend more. We are not really locked into to what happens in the economy for those actions.
Adam Uhlman: All right, that's helpful, thanks. And then, Ron, have you made any changes to the cash flow assumptions for this year?
Ronald Jadin: No. No changes.
Adam Uhlman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks, good morning.
DG Macpherson: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: Question on the OpEx line. OpEx to sales prove little more than a 70 basis points in 2016 and I know 2017 have incentive comp restoration and the DC ramp cuts, but not withstanding that is there kind of a ongoing opportunity to manage OpEx there within the context of nearly $3 billion spend line?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. I would say we are very focused on making sure that we get productivity out of our large pools of cost. We continue to get nice productivity out of our distribution centers which is a big cost. We are making changes in our context centers in 2017 to consolidate and take out some cost. We are working hard on the sales force and the tools we provided them so that we can grow without having to add headcount in equal parts to our growth. Really at every point in the organization we are focused on expense, spend money where customers care about it and then get productivity in every part of the organization.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And within the key line items of your guidance, gross margin revenue and SG&A would seem that that one is the most in your control to be able to guide conservatively. It has in fact on the again the ramp cost not withstanding?
Ronald Jadin: So, our guidance is our expectation at this point. So, we are I am not sure that you stand but you may. Our guidance is our expectation.
Christopher Glynn: Fair enough. And then, just finally you may alluded to but just wondering if any 4Q budget flush was also kind of seen in the manufacturing sector, January softer, it seems even January got softer even adjusting for the holiday timing.
Ronald Jadin: Yeah, we are watching that closely. It's a little bit too early to tell and I think once we get through, just as a reminder, January last year was our second highest growth month of the year after December. So, there is some holiday timing, I think there is some weather we did sell more cold weather product in December than we are selling in January for sure given what we have seen in the weather. So, there is a number of factors there. I wouldn't read too much into the first three weeks necessarily.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Justin Bergner of Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead.
Justin Bergner: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. So, the first question relates to I guess your comment that the US did a little bit better than you expected in the fourth quarter from the sales point of view. So, could you just maybe clarify if the overall company was sort of in line with your expectations and what part of the business came a little bit short of your expectations?
Ronald Jadin: Well. So, keep in mind we were comparing that to our Analyst Day. What we talked about in Analyst Day December was a little stronger really across the board. All Canada, the US, both were stronger, the rest of the business was basically on what we would have expected. So, that's why we are a little bit better. Yeah. Just slightly better than expectations. I wouldn't read too much into that and we've been talking about what happened in December and November and January and how much of that was holiday timing and other stuff. So, I wouldn't necessarily read too much into that and really nothing was significantly below expectations for December.
Justin Bergner: Okay. And restructuring seemed to end the year around $45 million, which is a little bit light of $50 million or $65 million guide. So, should I make anything of that in terms of how that will affect 2017 restructuring spend or did you find reasons to cut back on restructuring spend a bit?
Ronald Jadin: No. And some of that was estimates of what do we cost the restructure, sometimes were higher than we landed and so that won't have any impact. It should not have any impact on 2017.
Justin Bergner: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Duncan of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Matt Duncan: Hey, good morning everybody.
Ronald Jadin: Good morning.
DG Macpherson: Good morning.
Matt Duncan: So, first thing just want to try dig a little bit more on the sales trend and maybe kind of look at some of the algebra here. My recollection is that January's comparison is 4.8 points harder than December and you had two points of holiday benefit in December and I guess there is based on your comments some chance there has been a negative hit in January. So, is the change from December to January simply the comparison and the difference in holiday timing and maybe the underlying demand is still kind of where it was if not improving just some thoughts that will be great.
DG Macpherson: I think it's a little early to tell. I think some of the points you make are certainly on point, I think on US a lot this may in fact be timing and seasonal. I think in Canada there is a specific issue for us which is last January there was a lot of customer pre-buy before we went live with the system and so Canada will let goofy in both January and February. February will be a very easy compare and January is a very hard compared given the flow of what happened around that. Other than that I think we don't see any reason to think the underlying demand has changed dramatically.
Matt Duncan: Okay, that helps. And then Ron, on gross margin the year-over-year decline there in the fourth quarter specifically was a lot less than what you guys had been experiencing. Can you walk us through what caused that?
Ronald Jadin: Yes. With some easier comps essentially, or there was some unfavorable GP rate items in the fourth quarter of '15 that just gave us a bit of easier comp. And then some of the mix issues that we have with faster growth with some of our low margin businesses while they continue to grow. As they get bigger they have a lower mix impact, negative mix impact on GP, so as they mature and as their margins expand actually, the native impact of those businesses diminishes overtime.
Matt Duncan: Is there anything going on there with rebate levels given how strong December close down I mean you were flat at December 13 and came in up 6.5. You mentioned that you had a lot inventory kind of in trends in at the end of the year. So, just curious if maybe that you had a little bit better rebate accrual then you were then counting on previously?
DG Macpherson: Not materially. A little bit better but not material.
Matt Duncan: Okay. And then, last thing on Fabory.
DG Macpherson: Just because the thing is when you pre-buy, right, those rebates gets capitalized, you don't take those to the P&L.
Matt Duncan: Right, okay. Last thing from me on Fabory and I know it's a little bit of difficult discussion but it's been a while you guys have had trouble. You made good progress in trying to get it improved and making money for you. But it continues to be a little bit of a problem child. Is there a point in time in which you start thinking about divesting that business or is it a business that you feel like Grainger needs to be involved in going forward?
DG Macpherson: So, just to give you a little bit of history that the thesis when we got that, that those are really two pieces of the thesis. One was we could expand in Central Europe through a branch expansion strategy, the other was that we could diversify its product portfolio and make it a broad liner. We really struggled with those two, the first couple of years we had the business. We ended up having to reverse course, refocus it on fasteners, it is a fastener specialist. I think there is benefits to having specials in the portfolio. I think we understand how specialist compete. Having Fabory in the portfolio and we certainly get benefits from faster buy, from the company. But that said, it's not core to what we do. Right now we need to get it performing. We need to be performing better, we need to increase profitability, get it growing but we will always consider both term but what to do with the business but we are optimistic about the path it's on and we need to continue that path first before we consider alternatives.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning, thank you. Just the first question maybe for DG. DG, could you maybe talk about your supply chain and any issues you may be looking at given potential for tear it's and credit agreement changes as you look at your global supply chain?
Ronald Jadin: Yes. So, thanks Hamzah. So, we do a lot of analysis on our supply changes as a regular course of business to understand where we purchased whether we have unique exposure relative to competitors through our purchasing activities, we don't have much. So, trade agreements would certainly have an impact. We have alternative suppliers for many of those sources and we have those in place in plans if we need to go to those alternative sources. We don't feel like we will be unduly impacted by trade agreements. We don't buy more than our competitors do overseas as an example and we have alternatives for many of those suppliers. I think the broader issue, so for the sourcing that we own for our private brands that we globally source, I think we have a good set. For the branded product, there are some categories that really are not made much in the US anymore if at all and so trade agreements on those I don't know what would happen there and we'd have to figure that out and we haven't historically focused too much of our energy there because that hasn't been under our control but I think it's an interesting thing for us. We probably need to spend little more time thinking about that.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. And just last question, is it -- do you have a time line around when the Zoro business margins can get closer to your Japanese business? Is that realistic, it seems like there may be a lot of investments spend rolling through the P&L on Zoro. Just trying to get a sense of whether that business can mirror the Japanese business so is there anything structural there? Thank you.
DG Macpherson: Now, thanks. I think that Zoro's business will be very close to MonotaRO's overtime. And we continue to see expansion, we think it's going to be in the 8th this year in terms of operating margin and it will continue to get do that double digit number. Really the difference is advertising spend as we grow, so we invest a bunch to grow the business in Zoro. We are still acquiring customers that are really high rate. And as that business becomes more modest in its growth, more like MonotaRO, we would expect them the margins to be pretty much the same overtime.
Hamzah Mazari: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please go ahead.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.
DG Macpherson: Good morning.
Ronald Jadin: Good morning.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, just one question on some of the improvement trends in December versus what they were in November. I mean, all the areas got better but the US was a little less improvement, so you had Canada went from down 13 to up two, that's a big move. Other went from up seven up 19, both of those have these kind of double-digit moves. The US went from -2 to +1. In that reason what that would be more modest than the moves in the other areas?
Ronald Jadin: Well, I mean, I think in general our US business is less variable. So in down time it's down less and in up times it's up a little bit less and that's just the way the US business works. We serve the entire economy in the US, so we are very diversified. We are not as diversified in Canada, so if you have big projects, it can have a bigger impact. I think that's probably the basic dynamic there.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then just a follow-up on kind of this first quarter gross margin. You are down 30 in the fourth quarter and that we are going to be down 80 to 130 in the first quarter. You mentioned that how comp but I mean I think you already changed the counting for the trade show stuff last year. So, and maybe why the first quarter is tough gross margin comp for this year?
DG Macpherson: Well it's really a combination of both. The fourth quarter was a easier comp and the first quarter is a tougher comp. So, there is a couple of swings to account for but I would just reiterate that especially in Canada where we saw a real pressure on margins in this last year. The challenge will be recovering that through pricing actions in the first half of the year. Those won’t happen just in the first quarter.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. You mentioned that of course, that's really about Canada?
DG Macpherson: Yeah, that's a big part of it.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay.
DG Macpherson: And then the comps.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, yeah.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Robert Barry: Hey guys, good morning.
DG Macpherson: Good morning.
Ronald Jadin: Good morning.
Robert Barry: Lot of ground covered here. Maybe just a few follow-ups. First, on the much earlier commodity pricing question kind of when the commodities start to impact the pricing and I know it's not a precise dynamic but just as a benchmark like ISM prices component, right, which shows what OEMs are paying for inputs, it's been rising now for about 10 months. We've seen kind of what's been happening with the spot prices. I mean does it typically take that long to kind of trickle through and impact you or might be taking longer kind of through this cycle for some reason?
Ronald Jadin: Well, I think so it depends I would say where your starting position is. Given that went down so far and now they have been upper 10 months, I think it's probably taking a little bit longer but if they continue to stabilize at higher levels I think you will see it flow through. So, I think it's just what you are seeing now is just a function of how far they went. They dropped before coming up and in many cases they dropped a lot.
Robert Barry: Yeah. And remind us what's in the gross margin outlook, is there an assumption that you will start to get some benefit from pricing this year?
DG Macpherson: It's -1.
Ronald Jadin: It's -1, is the expectation. Now we also have expectation we will negative cost inflation this year as well.
DG Macpherson: 50.
Robert Barry: Right.
Ronald Jadin: About 50 basis points. So, if there was significant commodity increases that would, that would help us if that happens.
Robert Barry: Got you.
Ronald Jadin: But we don't have anything baked in there.
Robert Barry: I mean, what is your thought on being able to put through pricing if it starts to come from your vendors, just given a lot of the end markets are still pretty sluggish and there is a lot of small mum and pops and pops kind of cutting price to stay alive. I mean, do you think you could kind of get material pricing in this environment?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. If it's well known that the commodity prices are up, we generally do pretty well and we're able to pass that through and I think that would still be the case here.
Robert Barry: Got you. And then maybe just the last one on this clean energy. I think in November you expected that would be $0.10 benefit in '16, I think ended up being $0.15. So, is it all that $0.05 helping in the fourth quarter and was that just related to the weather?
Ronald Jadin: Great. A lot of its weather, a lot of it is just whether the facilities are running at full capacity or not. It's the dynamic of both of those two. So, we ended the year at about $0.15 and we think next year '17 will in the $0.10 to $0.15 range, so very similar.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Joseph Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Joseph Ritchie: Thanks, good morning guys.
DG Macpherson: Good morning.
Joseph Ritchie: So, just a couple of real quick ones. On the unclaimed property contingency just to be clear, there's no cash impact or is there a potential cash impact from that charge?
Ronald Jadin: There is none today but over the next few years we'll make attempt to either return cash or issue credits to customers, so eventually overtime there will be.
Joseph Ritchie: Got it. And what would potentially trigger that, I am just trying to understand it a little bit better.
DG Macpherson: We will trigger it by actively pursuing many customers and then states as well.
Joseph Ritchie: Got it, okay. And then as it relates to I know typically we've talked about pricing a lot. I guess just asking it very specifically typically January, February, timeframe. Do you put through some type of pricing increase and see. If I miss the answer earlier is there an expectation that you are going to try to pass price through in January or February or is it just a too difficult for the period of time to be able to do that today?
Ronald Jadin: Well, we are –- we have gone through a process and I'll focus on the US first. We are certainly going to have a price increase in Canada as we have talked about through the first half of the year. In the US, we are restructuring our price, we certainly have raised some prices and lowered others. We look at the market pricing and we've adjusted to that. So, there are some price increases in there and we would expect this to hold.
Joseph Ritchie: Okay. And then lastly one quick one on your just your import position. What percentage of your COGS do you import and we have it roughly 20% to 25%, I just want to make sure that we're ballpark correct.
Ronald Jadin: Well, I take that to our earlier discussion. If you said what is the percentage that we import that is part of our private brand which is what we have talked about historically. Our private brand is 20% to 25%, most of that is imported now, so probably 15% to 20% would be imported. And then if you included the brands that goes way up, so the branded products in our estimate would be 40% roughly but we have some work to do to really understand that.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. And this call has really helpful, thanks a lot for doing it. Just, so just -- Ron, I just wanted to double check that all of the one timers came through SG&A, correct?
Ronald Jadin: Yes, that's correct.
Nigel Coe: Okay, great. And then the uptick in December --.
Ronald Jadin: I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter they did. There were few early in the year that were excess and obsolescence for inventory, those would have been up in that GP. So, just to be clear, the fourth quarter that's true but earlier or in there is at least one or two.
Nigel Coe: Okay, great. -- My question.
Ronald Jadin: I am sorry. One more thing, just also the discreet tax items, maybe it's obvious but those are below the lines, those are in tax.
Nigel Coe: Right, okay, good, thanks. Thanks, Ron. Then the uptick in December, I mean maybe this is getting a bit too down on the ways, but did you see any differential between store versus direct. I mean, I'm just thinking about the margin differential between store and online. Was there any noticeable impact on either channel or nothing to call up that?
Ronald Jadin: It was, yeah, it was fairly even across both I would say. So, we saw upticks in all the channels.
Nigel Coe: Okay. And then going into January, the comment that slow down join to date, obvious Canada is the big part of that but is the same REIT for the US just given the time of the holidays and the comp?
Ronald Jadin: Yeah. I would say January started out sluggish based on some of the comps in the holiday discussion we had before, yes.
Nigel Coe: Okay. And then just finally, obviously big changes on some of the sales force during 2015. How do we think about the productivity where we are on the productivity curve for your just picking on the inside sales channel?
DG Macpherson: So, we have installed completely new processes over the last year at a new system support for sellers to help make them more productive. On the inside sales team, we're giving them much more clarity on who to call on, how frequently to call, what the returns are on those calls, I think we have got a long path for improvement here since we are very early in that process and figuring it out but it's pretty exciting in terms of the data we have now and the ability to drive improvement going forward.
Nigel Coe: So, in terms of getting up to full productivity, is that a year, is it two years, I mean how long is the time line?
DG Macpherson: On the inside sales team in particular?
Nigel Coe: Yeah.
DG Macpherson: Yeah, it's going to take probably 15 months to two years for any individual seller to get to full productivity typically.
Nigel Coe: Great. Thanks a lot.
DG Macpherson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.
DG Macpherson: So, great I think we -- okay. So, thanks for the time, I really appreciate everybody being on the call. I would just summarize it the quarter basically from an operating perspective was at or maybe slightly above expectations. Hopefully, we helped to explain some of the unusual items that we had in the quarter and we are holding on guidance for 2017 and we are certainly excited about what we have done in 2016 to prepare ourselves to grow and gain profit going forward. So, thanks for your time. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-18 07:30:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown - Senior Vice President Communications and Investor Relations Bill Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations
Analysts:
Laura Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger’s 2016 Third Quarter Results. This podcast supplements our 2016 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 18th and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. Today we reported results for the 2016 third quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to-date and the challenging industrial economy. Before we begin our review of results, I’d like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we adjust the reported results to exclude any items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance.  Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompanying today’s earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. The 2016 third quarter included restructuring charges in the U.S. and Canadian segments. In both countries, we are closing branches and reducing headcount to proactively address changes in customer buying behavior and better position the business for profitable growth. These actions had a net charge of $0.01 to earnings per share.  In 2015, we took restructuring actions that resulted in net charges of $0.11 per share. All figures from this point forward represent adjusted amounts unless specifically noted. With that as a backdrop, let’s look at our results for the 2016 third quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 3% versus the 2015 third quarter. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 5%, and net earnings decreased 6%. Earnings per share were $3.06, up 1% versus the prior year. Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of this podcast. We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5% and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70. Our 2016 guidance issued on July 19th 2016 was 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. Let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the third quarter decreased 180 basis points to 40.1% versus 41.9% in 2015, due primarily to unfavorable customer mix and modest negative price-cost mix in the United States and price deflation versus product cost inflation in Canada.  Operating expenses for the company were essentially flat. We attained positive expense leverage as operating expenses as a percent of sales were 27.3%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year. The third quarter benefited from operating expense favorability from the timing of certain professional expenses and other program-related expenses.  Total company operating earnings were $332 million, a decrease of 5% versus the prior year. Company operating margin for the quarter was 12.8%, a decline of 110 basis points versus the 2015 quarter. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September, second, operating performance by segment, third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 3%. Daily sales performance by month was as follows: up 3% in July, up 4% in August and flat in September. Excluding the Cromwell acquisition in the first two months of the quarter, sales performance by month was down 1% in July, up 1% in August and flat in September.  Results for the quarter included two percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, which we anniversaried on September 1st, and 1 percentage point contribution from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat consisting of a 1 percentage point contribution from sales of seasonal products offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 1%.  Results for the quarter included a 1 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro. Let’s review sales performance by customer-end market in the United States: Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits; Light Manufacturing was up in the low single-digits; Commercial was flat; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the mid-single digits; Reseller was down in the low double-digits and Natural Resources was down in the mid-teens. We believe that growth in the Government and Retail end-markets was primarily a function of share gains as we outperformed our estimated growth of the market. Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues. Sales for the quarter decreased 16% in U.S. dollars and local currency, consisting of a 15 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price. All end-markets in Canada were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22%, compared to all other provinces which were down 12% in aggregate. In addition to a challenging economy, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system and expect improvement in the coming months. Let’s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 19% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 36%, consisting of 16 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 15 percentage points from volume and price and 5 percentage points from foreign exchange.  The organic sales increase was primarily due to growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months.  Let’s now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were essentially flat in September versus the prior year. The sales performance consisted of 1 percentage point from volume offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price. In the United States, September daily sales were flat, driven by a 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price. September customer end-market performance in the United States was as follows: Government and Retail were up in the low single-digits; Light Manufacturing was flat; Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the low single-digits; Contractor was down in the mid-single-digits and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the low double-digits. The benefit often seen from federal government customers at the September fiscal year end appears to have been realized a month early, as we saw strong growth to that end-market in August.  In addition, the strong sales of seasonal products that benefited August did not continue into September. Sales in Canada for September were down 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. The 15% decrease was driven by a 15 percentage point decline in volume. All end-markets except Light Manufacturing were negative.  From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22%, compared to all other provinces which were down 13% in aggregate. As mentioned in the quarter recap, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system. Sales for our Other Businesses increased 17% percent in September, consisting of 14 percentage points from volume and price and 3 percentage points from foreign exchange. September was the first month where Cromwell sales were already included in the base results. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., MonotaRO in Japan and the business in Mexico. Sales growth in the month of October to-date is slightly below the sales performance in September. Multiple branches in the southeast and the distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida were closed earlier this month due to Hurricane Matthew. We believe there may be an effect on October sales, but it is too early to quantify that impact or any possible cleanup benefit.  Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Thanks Laura. Let’s talk about performance by reportable segment since we have already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all figures below represent results adjusted for restructuring charges that Laura discussed earlier. In the United States, operating earnings decreased 6% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 130 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation exceeding product cost deflation.  Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower payroll and benefits costs. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.1% in the 2015 quarter. Let’s move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $11 million in the quarter, versus operating earnings of $5 million in the 2015 third quarter, primarily driven by lower sales and lower gross profit.  The gross profit margin in Canada declined 520 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Due to service gaps stemming from the systems transition, we have not passed on price increases to customers this year and this is putting pressure on our gross profit margins.  Operating expenses were down 9% versus the 2015 quarter driven by lower SAP costs and lower headcount. The new IT system continues to be a change management challenge for this business. However, we are making progress in areas such as direct-to-customer shipping, which has already increased each quarter for the year. In the third quarter, 38% of shipments went direct to the customer, bypassing the branch network. We will provide more detail about the Canadian business at our Analyst Meeting in November. Operating earnings for the Other Businesses were $25 million in the 2016 third quarter versus $15 million in the prior year, representing an earnings increase of 68%. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $29 million expense in the 2016 third quarter versus a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company’s $400 million debt offering in May of 2016.  Operating losses from the clean energy investments were higher as a result of higher demand from a warm summer resulting in a higher overall benefit to the company, net of tax credits. For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate in 2016 was 34% versus 38.4% in 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to a higher benefit from the company’s clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions.  The 2016 third quarter also included a benefit from the conclusion of the federal income tax audit for the years 2009 through 2012 and other discrete items. Excluding the discrete items, the company’s effective tax rate was 36.1%.  We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items of 36.1% to 37.1% for the full year 2016 versus 36.8% to 37.8% provided on July 19, 2016. This decrease is driven by the expectation of higher benefit from the clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions. Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $344 million versus $366 million in 2015, primarily the result of lower net income. We used the cash generated during the quarter and proceeds from the May 2016 debt offering to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.  We returned a total of $275 million to shareholders in the quarter including $74 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016.  In addition, we bought back 887,000 shares of stock for $201 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter, versus $82 million in the third quarter of 2015.  As reported in our 2016 third quarter earnings release, we updated our 2016 guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1.5% to 2.5% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70. Let’s look more closely at our current expectations. We’ll begin with sales. For the full year, our guidance is lowered to reflect year-to-date performance and the expectation of continued modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we will have 63 selling days in the 2016 fourth quarter, one fewer than the 64 selling days in the 2015 fourth quarter. Moving on to gross profit margins, for the full year, we expect gross profit margins to be down 170 to 180 basis points. We continue to see gross profit pressure due to unfavorable price-cost spread for the businesses in the United States and Canada, along with faster growth with the lower margin single-channel businesses. We expect gross margin pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. Let’s take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we now anticipate operating margin of 12.3% to 12.5%, down 100 to 120 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase as a percentage of sales versus the 2016 third quarter, reflecting the following: number one the loss of a selling day; two, three months of depreciation for the new distribution center in New Jersey versus two months in the 2016 third quarter; three, the hiring of 30 new inside sales representatives in the fourth quarter to call on medium-sized customers given the success of the 275 inside sales reps added in the 2016 second quarter and fourth, the operating expense favorability in the 2016 third quarter related to the timing of program-related expenses and professional services that are not expected to repeat in the 2016 fourth quarter. Finally, earnings per share. As noted earlier, we expect 2016 EPS of $11.40 to $11.70. For the full year, we now expect a $0.10 benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the two clean energy investments, compared to our prior projection of a $0.07 benefit on July 19, 2016. Through the first nine months of the year, we have realized $0.06 per share of benefit from the investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail.  Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates: we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11th, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. We also plan to release October sales on November 11th. On Tuesday, November 15th, we will participate in the Barclays Select Series Industrial Distribution Forum in New York, New York.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-07-19 07:30:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President-Communications & Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President-Communications & Investor Relations: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2016 Second Quarter Results. This podcast supplements our 2016 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 19, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website, for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. Today, we reported results for the 2016 second quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to-date and the challenging industrial economy. I also wanted to report on our progress on key initiatives since we're at the midpoint of the year. We've made many important investments in this business despite the current economic challenges. We're investing in our supply chain, our eCommerce capability, our onsite services and tools to make our sales force more efficient. In the United States, in the quarter, we launched a new inside sales team, which has 275 representatives calling on our medium-sized customers. We closed 27 branches in the United States, as part of a previously announced plan, to adjust the U.S. branch network. In Canada, we installed SAP to allow for better visibility to our data and our inventory at a North American level. We also increased direct-to-customer shipping to improve service and efficiency. As of the end of the quarter, 24% of shipments were going direct to the customer. eCommerce represented 46% of sales in the first half of the year, up from 40% in the first-half 2015, illustrating our strength in helping customers using the tools and channels they prefer. And the single channel online businesses increased revenue 34% on a daily basis over the 2015 second quarter. Overall, we remain confident in our U.S. performance for the year, despite the tough environment we're operating in. Canada's results were lower than anticipated and significantly contributed to the earnings shortfall versus our expectations, but we believe in the long-term prospects of the business and are executing a plan to improve performance. Finally, our single channel online businesses continued their rapid growth, serving mostly small customers in the United States and Japan. Before we begin review of our results, I'd like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the second quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we will adjust the reported results to exclude items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance. Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompany today's earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. In the quarter, we took several actions to restructure the business for long-term success. We initiated $6 million of restructuring costs in the United States. Those costs were more than offset by gains on sales of branch real estate of $15 million. Overall, we realized a net savings of $0.09 earnings per share. We had restructuring costs of $8 million in Canada, primarily related to severance, or $0.09 per share. Also in Canada, we reported a $10 million, or $0.12 per share, negative adjustment to inventory as a result of revisions to the reserves methodology, based on additional visibility of inventory performance provided by the recent conversion to the U.S. SAP system. We wrote down the value of a plane we are selling as part of eliminating aviation operations, which had a $0.09 impact to earnings per share. Lastly, the quarter also included a benefit of $0.11 per share from the effective settlement of certain federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 through 2012. These actions had a net effect of $0.10 of charges to earnings per share. In 2015, we took $0.02 per share in charges related to restructuring at Fabory and the shutdown of the Brazil business. With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2016 second quarter. All figures below reflect adjusted results unless specifically noted. Company sales for the quarter increased 2% versus the 2015 second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 10%, and net earnings decreased 20%. Earnings per share were $2.89, down 12% versus the prior year. Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of the podcast. We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1% to 4%, and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. Our 2016 guidance issued on April 18, 2016, included 0% to 6% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.00 to $12.80. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 160 basis points to 41% versus 42.6% in 2015, due to unfavorable price-cost mix in the United States and Canada. Operating expenses for the company increased 2%, primarily due to the addition of Cromwell expenses not recorded in last year's results. Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 28.4%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Total company operating earnings were $323 million, a decrease of 10% versus the prior year. The operating margin was 12.6%, a decrease of 160 basis points versus the prior year. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of the businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 2%. Sales growth by month was as follows: up 4% in April, up 1% in May, and flat in June. Results for the quarter included 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2% driven by a 1 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 3%. Results for the quarter included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 2 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government and retail were up in the low single-digits. Light manufacturing was flat. Commercial was down in the low single-digits. Heavy manufacturing was down in the mid-single-digits. Contractor was down in the high single-digits, and Natural resources and reseller were down in the mid-teens. As we announced previously, we realigned our sales force on May 1 to better serve government, manufacturing, commercial and healthcare customers. We are currently experiencing some sales disruption due to the transition, but we expect the new structure to drive increased growth, share gain and better efficiency. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 8% of total company revenues. Reflecting the tough Canadian economy, and particularly the energy sector, sales for the quarter decreased 19% in U.S. dollars and declined 16% in local currency versus the prior year. The 16% sales decrease consisted of a 14 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta. All end markets, except government and forestry, were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in oil-producing Alberta were down 28% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 18% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 49%, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price, and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO, partially offset by lower sales in Latin America. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were flat in June versus the prior year. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions, offset by a 3 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price. In the United States, June daily sales decreased 3%, driven by a 4 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 2 percentage points from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: retail was flat; light manufacturing, government and commercial were down in the low single-digits; heavy manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits; contractor was down in the high single-digits; reseller was down in the mid-teens, and natural resources was down in the high-teens. The performance of the government end market was affected by softer sales to state and local customers at the June fiscal year-end compared to 2015. Given that 2015 was exceptionally strong, the low single-digit decline was within our expectations. Similar to the quarter, sluggish demand and sales force changes contributed to the lower sales performance in June. Sales in Canada for June were down 23% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. The 18% decrease was driven by a 17 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta, partially offset by 1 percentage point from price. All end markets were negative. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 30% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate. Sales for our Other Businesses increased 46% in June, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 14 percentage points from volume and price, and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S. and Japan, partially offset by lower sales for Fabory in Europe and Latin America. As a reminder, we will anniversary the Cromwell acquisition on September 1, 2016. Sales growth in the month of July to-date is in line with the sales performance in June. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman - Senior Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, Laura. Let's talk about performance by reportable segment, since we have already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all figures below represent adjusted results. In the United States, operating earnings decreased 8% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.2% in the 2015 quarter. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 90 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation greater than product cost deflation. Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower advertising costs. Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter versus operating earnings of $9 million in the 2015 second quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 640 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the combination of price deflation and cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Operating expenses were down 12% versus the 2015 quarter, driven by lower SAP costs versus the prior year and lower advertising costs. The Canadian business is undergoing significant change management as a result of the SAP conversion, though we have confidence in our leadership team and the plan to return the business to long-term profitable growth. Operating earnings in the Other Businesses were $30 million in the 2016 second quarter. Operating earnings in the 2015 second quarter were $17 million, representing an earnings increase of $13 million or 73% versus the prior year. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $23 million of expense in the 2016 second quarter, versus a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company's debt offerings in 2015 and 2016. Operating losses from the clean energy investments were lower than expected in the quarter as a result of lower demand for refined coal, given relatively mild weather. For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate in 2016 was 36.6%, versus 35.4% in 2015. The 2016 second quarter included an $0.11 per share benefit from the effective settlement of certain federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 through 2012. Excluding this discrete benefit, the company's effective tax rate was 39.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 second quarter, excluding a year-to-date adjustment for the benefit from the company's first clean energy investment, was 36.9%. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate, excluding the settlement benefit, was primarily due to a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions, and lower benefit from the clean energy investments in the quarter. We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 36.8% to 37.8% for the full year 2016, versus 35.2% to 36.2% provided on April 19, 2016. The increase since April is driven by the expectation of continued earnings concentration in higher tax rate jurisdictions, and lower benefit from the clean energy investments. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $173 million versus $213 million in 2015, as a result of lower earnings. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We bought back 1,033,000 shares of stock for $241 million in the second quarter. Grainger returned a total of $315 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $75 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016. Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter, versus $71 million in the second quarter of 2015. We have revised our full year guidance for capital expenditures to $300 million to $325 million, from $300 million to $350 million announced in November of 2015. As reported in our 2016 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2016 sales and earnings per share guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1% to 4% sales growth, and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, the midpoint of guidance is now 2.5% growth, reflecting lower-than-expected volume in the United States and Canada. We now expect foreign exchange to have no net impact on sales for the full year, due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen. As a reminder, we anniversary the Cromwell acquisition at the beginning of September. Moving on to gross profit margins, for the full year, we still expect gross profit margins to be down 130 basis points to 150 basis points versus 2015. Gross profit margins for the third quarter are forecasted to be down 100 basis points to 140 basis points versus the prior year. Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we now expect operating margin compression of 60 basis points to 130 basis points. The midpoint of operating margin guidance remains unchanged, as gross profit improvements over April guidance offset expense deleveraging on lower sales. The full year guidance implies modest improvement in the second half of the year versus previous guidance. This is due to continued strong expense management and better-than-expected gross profit margin in the United States. So for the third quarter, we expect operating margins to be down 80 basis points to 170 basis points versus the prior year. Next, other income and expense. We issued $400 million of new debt in mid-May, so there was about half of a quarter's worth of increased interest expense in the second quarter. The third quarter and fourth quarters will contain the full three months' of the higher interest expense. Finally, earnings per share. As noted, we revised our guidance and we now expect earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. We now expect a $0.07 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the two clean energy investments compared to the prior projection of $0.15 per share benefit on April 18, 2016. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail. The earnings per share guidance includes the projected tax rate of 36.8% to 37.8% for 2016, reflecting a higher proportion of earnings from higher tax jurisdictions. Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On August 11, we plan to release July sales and we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at 847-535-0409, Michael Ferreter at 847-535-1439 or me, Bill Chapman at 847-535-0881. Thank you so much for your interest in Grainger.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-18 07:30:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown - Senior Vice President Communications and Investor Relations William Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations
Analysts:
Laura Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger’s first quarter 2016 results. This podcast is supplemented by our 2016 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 18, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on the Investor Relations website, for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. Tables reconciling non-GAAP measures accompany the script to this podcast and today’s earnings release, which are both available on our Investor Relations website. Today we reported our 2016 first quarter results. While we are currently experiencing economic headwinds and our short term results are affected, we continue to manage the business for the long term. Our investments in eCommerce, KeepStock and supply chain, including the New Jersey and Toronto distribution centers, will provide and support growth for years to come. We have also invested in tools and processes that will make us more productive including a new CRM system and SAP in Canada and Mexico. Now, let’s cover the specifics for the quarter. A stronger-than-expected January, due to carryover spending from fourth quarter customer shutdowns and favorable holiday timing, contributed to our sales performance. The difficult economic environment and headwind from last year’s strong sales of seasonal products and Ebola-related products were also considerations. Solid expense management and the timing of planned spending offset some of the gross margin pressure. In Canada, we completed the installation of SAP, which will drive better service and increased productivity over time. However, we saw a further slowdown in February and March due to the implementation, which also had an unfavorable impact on expenses. And our single channel online businesses of Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan posted continued strong performance. Let’s now look at the quarter in detail. Company sales increased 3%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, one more than the previous year. On a daily basis, sales increased 1%. Reported operating earnings declined 10% and net earnings were down 12%. Reported earnings per share of $2.98 were down 3% versus $3.07 in the previous year. The first quarter in both years contained restructuring items as noted in the press release issued today, April 18. Please refer to the adjusted results found in the press release. All results referenced in the remainder of this podcast are adjusted unless specifically noted. Now, let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins decreased 300 basis points versus the prior year to 41.8% driven by lower performance in the U.S. and Canada segments. Operating expenses for the company declined 4%, driven by restructuring benefits and the timing of planned spending. Company operating earnings declined 5% versus the 2015 quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Company operating margins were down 110 basis points versus the prior year to 13.4%. Net income was $199 million, down 6%. Earnings per share of $3.18 were up 3% from the 2015 first quarter. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we’ll wrap up with the discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. For consistency, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales. Company sales for the quarter increased 1% on a daily basis. The 1% sales growth included 4 percentage point from Cromwell acquired on September 1, 2015, and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales declined 2% driven by a 3 percentage point reduction in price and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point increase from higher volume. By month, daily sales were as follows; up 4% in January, up 1% in February, and down 1% in March. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Our Other Businesses also include results from our single channel online businesses in Japan, MonotaRO; the United States, Zoro; and Europe. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 75% of total company revenue in the quarter, were down 2% on a daily basis. The 2% decrease was driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 1% from volume growth and a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro, the single channel online business in the United States. Let’s review sales performance by customer end-market for the quarter in the United States. Government was up in the mid-single-digits. Light Manufacturing and Retail were up in the low-single-digits. Commercial was down in the low-single-digits. Contractor and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single-digits. Reseller was down in the low-double-digits. And Natural Resources was down in the mid-teens. Now, let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a challenging economy given the country’s exposure to oil and gas. Results reported in U.S. dollars were further affected by the strong U.S. dollar. Sales for our business in Canada declined 25% on a daily basis and 17% on a daily basis in local currency. The 17% decline consisted of 14 percentage points from lower volume and 6 percentage points from the SAP implementation, partially offset by 3 percentage points from price. The Canadian business installed SAP on February 1, 2016. As expected, the business experienced lower sales following implementation, as team members became acclimated to the new system. All customer end-markets were lower in the quarter. On a geographic basis, daily sales in the province of Alberta, which represents about a third of the company’s business in Canada, was down 26% in local currency. Local currency sales for all other provinces were down 10%. Let’s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. This group includes our operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America, and represents about 18% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 47% on a daily basis, consisting of 33 percentage points from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015, and 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by the strong performance from the single channel online businesses in the United States and Japan, which grew 34% on a daily basis. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February, and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let’s now take a look at March. There were 23 selling days in March of 2016, one more than in 2015. Company daily sales declined 1% versus March of 2015. Sales results in March included 4 percentage points from acquisitions, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for the month. Excluding acquisitions, organic daily sales declined 5% driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point reduction from the timing of the Easter holiday, a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of Ebola-related products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from volume. In the United States, daily sales in March declined 5%. This decline was due to a 3 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point reduction from the timing of the Easter holiday, a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of Ebola-related products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro. March customer end-market performance in the United States was as follows. Government was up in the mid-single-digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Retail was down in the low-single-digits. Commercial was down in the mid-single-digits. Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the high-single-digits. And Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-teens. Daily sales in Canada for March were down 20% and down 18% in local currency. The 18% daily sales decline consisted of a 16 percentage point decline in volume, a 3 percentage point decline from the SAP implementation and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point benefit from price. The volume decline was seen in all customer end markets. On a geographic basis, sales performance in Canada was driven by softness in the province of Alberta, which was down 24% in local currency in March. All other provinces were down about 18%. Daily sales in March for our Other Businesses increased 41%. The daily sales growth consisted of 31 percentage points from Cromwell and 10 percentage points from volume and was primarily driven by Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. Performance for the Other Businesses was driven by 28% daily sales growth for the single channel online businesses. Our businesses in Latin America and Fabory in Europe were affected by the timing of Easter, where extended holidays are more common. Turning to April, daily sales growth to date has benefited from the timing of the Easter holiday. We are expecting low-single-digit sales growth for the full month. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let’s move right into results by reportable segment. As a reminder, all results in the podcast are adjusted to exclude restructuring unless specifically noted. Operating earnings in the United States declined 5% versus the 2015 first quarter, with operating margins down 90 basis points to 17.7% versus 18.6% in the prior year. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 260 basis points, driven by greater sales to lower margin customers and price deflation greater than COGS deflation. Approximately 80 basis points of the reduction, was due to changes in the classification of certain funding received from vendors related to the annual trade show. Operating expenses in the U.S. segment decreased 7% driven by lower payroll and benefit costs and timing of planned spending and $10 million of supplier funding for the trade show. Let’s move on to our business in Canada, which had a loss of $9 million in the quarter versus a $9 million in profit in the prior year. The decrease was driven by the sales decline, lower gross profit margins and unfavorable operating expense leverage. The gross profit margin in Canada was down 660 basis points, with about one-third of the decline due to not having a trade show this year in Canada and about two-thirds from product mix driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. Expenses were down 18% versus the prior year, but the business experienced negative expense leverage given the 24% decline in reported revenue. We believe our investments in supply chain and IT in Canada set the stage for improved performance for this business. Our Other Businesses generated $22 million in operating earnings for the 2016 quarter versus $12 million in 2015. This performance was primarily driven by strong results from Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO, along with the incremental earnings from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015. Operating margin for the Other Businesses in the quarter increased 100 basis points, from 3.9% to 4.9% year-over-year. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net expense of $20 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $4 million in the 2015 first quarter. The increase is due to interest expense from the $1 billion of debt the company issued in 2015, as well as expected losses from the company’s investment in clean energy. For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2016 was 35.6% versus 38.4% in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the company’s investments in clean energy. We are still projecting an effective tax rate of 35.2% to 36.2% in the full year 2016. Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $154 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $156 million in the 2015 first quarter. The company used the cash generated, along with short-term borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $99 million in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a lower planned spend for 2016 and the timing of ongoing projects. We returned $245 million to shareholders through $73 million in dividends and $172 million to buy back 893,000 shares of stock. Now let’s take a look at guidance. As mentioned in the press release, we have narrowed our 2016 guidance range for sales and earnings per share. Our new guidance reflects increased gross profit pressure for the year and increased operating expense favorability, although not to the same extent as the first quarter. Let’s look more closely at the underlying elements of our expectations versus adjusted results in 2015. We’ll begin with sales. We narrowed our sales guidance range and maintained a midpoint of 3% reported growth. We now expect price to be a little worse, down 2%, and foreign exchange to be a little better, down 1%, both for the full year. Although price was down 3% in the first quarter, we expect price to improve slightly in the final three quarters. We normally issue a price increase in January, but we intend to increase prices on a selective group of items as the year progresses. Moving on to gross profit margins. Given the deflationary environment, we are taking a cautious view on gross margins and are lowering our gross margin expectations by 80 basis points. So for the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus 2015. For the 2016 second quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus the 2015 second quarter. On operating expense for the year, we expect operating expense to sales to be flat to down 90 basis points. For the second quarter, we expect operating expense to sales to be down 40 to 60 basis points. Let’s take a closer look at operating margin expectations. The gross profit and operating expense adjustments offset, resulting in unchanged operating margin guidance from January. So for the full year, we expect 40 to 150 basis points of operating margin compression versus the prior year. For the 2016 second quarter, operating margins are forecasted to be down 70 to 110 basis points. On restructuring in the first quarter, we closed five branches in the United States, and we expect to close 50 more in the remainder of the year. While negligible in the first quarter, we now anticipate gains on sales of restructuring related assets to be $5 million to $10 million pretax over the rest of the year. Unlike the $7 million gain on sale of the former Toronto distribution center due to relocation, the branch gains are an offset to restructuring costs and are not in our guidance. We wanted to share this detail as it drives reported results, from expenses to earnings per share and net working assets to cash flow. Now on our non-operating initiatives, we anticipate our next issuance of $400 million in long-term debt in the second quarter as part of our planned $800 million in share repurchases for 2016. As communicated early this year, we entered into a second clean energy investment, which generates operating losses but is also eligible for tax credits. We expect about $0.15 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the two clean energy investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information. Finally, earnings per share, we narrowed our range for earnings per share. Similar to sales, we did not adjust the midpoint due to uncertainty about the economy and the first quarter expense favorability that will not repeat to the same extent. Please mark your calendar for the following upcoming events on April 27, we will host our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The script from that meeting will be available on our website following the event. We plan to report April sales information on May 13. And on May 18, Jim Ryan, Ron Jadin and D.G. Macpherson will present at the Electrical Products Group meeting in Longboat Key, Florida. This event will also be webcast. We appreciate your support and thank you for your interest in Grainger.

Q - :

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-01-26 00:00:00) =====
Laura Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. 
 The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's fourth quarter 2015 results. This podcast is supplemented by our 2015 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 26, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. Tables reconciling non-GAAP measures accompany the script of this podcast in today's earnings release and are both available on our Investor Relations website.
 The macroeconomic conditions faced by our industry in 2015 are well documented and largely understood. What's less understood is that we took action by reducing costs and continued to invest more in the business. Our full year revenue was in line with our previous guidance. And adjusted earnings per share results were above the midpoint of our guidance.
 As mentioned in the press release, we also reiterated our 2016 sales guidance of negative 1% to 7% and earnings per share guidance of $10.80 to $13 which was first issued on November 12, 2015. At the end of this podcast, we will provide more color around our assumptions.
 Now let's take a look at our performance. For the full year, company sales of $10 billion were flat with 2014. Net earnings decreased 4% to $769 million, and earnings per share increased 1% to $11.58. The year contained restructuring/nonoperating items that lowered reported earnings by $0.36 per share. The year 2014 contained charges that lowered reported earnings by $0.81 per share. To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of these items in 2015 and 2014 unless specifically noted.  Details regarding the items can be found in the earnings release posted on the Investor Relations' website and in the exhibits at the end of this podcast.
 Excluding these items from 2015 and 2014, company operating earnings decreased 5% for the year while net earnings declined 8%. Adjusted earnings per share were $11.94 for the year, representing a 3% decline versus $12.26 in 2014. Earnings per share performance benefited from fewer shares outstanding as a result of 6.1 million shares repurchased during the year.
 Now let's turn to the 2015 fourth quarter. Company sales in the fourth quarter declined 1%. Reported operating earnings decreased 6%, and reported net earnings decreased 2%. Reported earnings per share were $2.30, a 7% increase versus the 2014 quarter.
 Overall, our quarterly results were above our guidance issued at our analyst meeting on November 12. As a reminder, our guidance does not include restructuring or nonoperating items. Excluding the items from 2015 and 2014, adjusted operating earnings decreased 11%, while net earnings decreased 19%.
 Adjusted earnings per share were $2.49 for the quarter, representing a decline of 11% versus the 2014 fourth quarter. Results in 2015 benefited from a net $0.16 per share of nonrepeating operating items in the fourth quarter, primarily related to the shift in timing of the implementation of SAP in Canada into 2016 and a onetime reduction in health care liabilities in the United States.
 Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Adjusted gross margins were 40.5% compared to 42.5% in the 2014 fourth quarter due to lower price, unfavorable customer mix and lower gross profit margins from the Cromwell acquisition.
 On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter decreased 11%. The earnings decline was driven by the 1% sales decrease and lower gross profit margins. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3%, including $32 million in incremental growth-related spending. Adjusted company operating margins decreased 130 basis points to 11.4% for the quarter from 12.7% a year ago.
 Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items.
 As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter decreased 1%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 1% sales decline for the quarter consisted of a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 1 percent point decline from price, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat, partially offset by 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition.
 Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America, are reported under a group titled Other Businesses, and also include results for the single-channel online model businesses in Japan, the United States and Europe.
 Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter decreased 3%. The 3% sales decline for the quarter was driven by 2 percentage point decline from volume, a 1 percentage point decline from price, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat, partially offset by a 1 percentage point from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and a 1 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Christmas holiday.
 Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Retail was up in the mid-single digits. Government was up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Contractor and Commercial were down in the mid-single digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the high single digits. Reseller was down in the low double digits, and Natural Resources was down in the low 20s.
 Weak oil prices continued to affect our sales to Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 150 basis point drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. This compares to a 110 basis point drag for the year, indicating sequential deceleration.
 Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada decreased 27% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency. The 14% sales decrease consisted of a 17 percentage point decrease from volume and a 1 percentage point decrease from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 4 percentage point contribution from price. Weakness in the Oil and Gas industries continued to affect sales to Canada's customers. All end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down versus the prior year. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down about 30% in the quarter, whereas sales in all other provinces, in aggregate, were down 4% versus the prior year.
 Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America and currently represents about 18% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 41% in the 2015 fourth quarter versus the prior year. This performance consisted of 33 percentage points from the acquisition of Cromwell and 18 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth in the Other Businesses was primarily driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States.
 Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Now let's take a look at December. There were 22 selling days in December in both years. Total company sales were flat versus December 2014 and consisted of 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 1 percentage point benefit from the favorable timing of the Christmas holiday, offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 1 percentage point decline from volume, a 1 percentage point decline from price and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat.
 In the United States, December sales decreased 2%, driven by a 2 percentage point decline in volume, a 1 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point decline from sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of Ebola-related safety products that did not repeat, partially offset by 1 percentage point from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Christmas holiday.
 December customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Retail was up in the mid-single digits; Light Manufacturing and Government were up in the low single digits; Contractor, Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low 20s.
 Daily sales in Canada for December decreased 30% in U.S. dollars and were down 17% in local currency. The 17% sales decrease consisted of an 18 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decrease from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point benefit from price. Similar to the quarter, all end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down versus prior year. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down about 30% in December, whereas sales in all other provinces in aggregate were down 8% versus the prior year.
 Daily sales for the Other Businesses increased 41% in December, consisting of 30 percentage points from acquisitions and 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 7 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The organic growth was driven by Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan.
 Let's move on to January. Please note that we benefited from New Year's Day falling on a Friday in 2016. In 2015, the holiday was on a Thursday, resulting in light sales on Friday, January 2. Daily sales growth in the month of January to date is trending better than December's flat sales performance, even after adjusting for the holiday benefit. Late January sales may be affected by the winter storm in the northeast. There were 35 branches closed on Friday, January 22. And at this point, we do not have a clear picture as to the magnitude of lost sales.
 Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman. 
William Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we have already reviewed operating performance at a company level, we will discuss performance by reporting segment. As a reminder, results in this discussion exclude the restructuring, nonoperating items detailed in the earnings press release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website and in the exhibits at the end of this podcast.
 Adjusted operating earnings in the United States decreased 9% versus the 2014 fourth quarter, driven by lower sales and a lower gross profit. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 160 basis points as a result of price deflation exceeding cost deflation and better relative performance with lower-margin customers.
 Operating expenses declined due to lower employee benefits, partially offset by higher contract service costs and included $22 million of growth in infrastructure spending. On an adjusted basis, the U.S. operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 16.1% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2014.
 Let's move on to our business in Canada. Adjusted operating earnings declined 60% versus the 2014 fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by lower sales and a lower gross profit. The 2015 fourth quarter contained favorable inventory adjustments versus the 2014 fourth quarter. The gross profit margin in Canada improved 150 basis points versus the prior year. In the absence of those inventory adjustments, the gross profit margin would have been down 200 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in Canada were down 15%.
 On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses had $10 million in operating earnings in the 2015 fourth quarter versus breakeven in the 2014 period. The increase in adjusted earnings was driven by better performance from MonotaRO and Zoro. In addition, Cromwell's results were in line with our expectations.
 Other income and expense was a net expense of $17 million in the 2015 fourth quarter versus net expense of $5 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to higher interest expense and losses from the company's investment in clean energy that began in 2015.
 The effective tax rate in 2015 was 36.5% for the quarter and 37.2% for the full year. Excluding the effect of restructuring, nonoperating items, the adjusted tax rate was 39.2% for the quarter and 37.6% for 2015 compared to 38.2% in the 2014 quarter and year. The increase in the adjusted quarterly rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the United States versus geographies with lower tax rates. The company's clean energy investment generated $0.09 per share of earnings for the year.
 The company is currently projecting a tax rate of 35.2% to 36.2% in 2016 compared to the prior projection of 36.3% to 37.3% on November 12, 2015. The lower tax rate is driven by the incremental benefit from the company's second clean energy investment which closed in early January of this year.
 Lastly, let's take a look at our cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $256 million versus $300 million in the 2014 quarter. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with proceeds from debt, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
 Gross capital expenditures for the quarter were $121 million versus $147 million in 2014. We paid dividends of $75 million in the quarter, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. In addition, we bought back 1 million shares of stock for $224 million and ended the quarter with 9.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases made throughout the year contributed $0.21 per share to earnings per share in the fourth quarter. In total, we returned $299 million to shareholders in the quarter.
 As we noted earlier, we reiterated our 2016 sales and EPS guidance. The following information is provided to help you better model our 2016 financials. Keep in mind, this reflects adjusted results in 2015 as a basis for comparison. 
 Sales. Please note that the first quarter contains an extra sales day versus 2015. The trend reverses in the fourth quarter when we have 1 less selling day versus 2015. Also, please be aware that the first quarter is our most difficult comparison of 2016 as the 2015 first quarter saw the strongest sales growth from the U.S. segment. Please see Exhibit 6.
 Canada. While the macroeconomic conditions are well understood, we want to stress that operating results in Canada will remain under pressure for much of 2016. The installation of SAP is the business' top priority, and there will be a stabilization period following. In addition, certain expenses tied to the installation of SAP that were planned to be spent in the fourth quarter of 2015, shifted to the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the first quarter will contain an additional expense of about $10 million.
 Supplier funding. We have modified how we account for supplier funding of our annual trade shows which take place in the first quarter. Previously, both gross profit and operating expenses, as a percent of sales, were inflated in the first quarter relative to other quarters by about 100 basis points. Starting in 2016, a portion of the funds received from suppliers will now be accounted for as a reduction in the trade show expenses rather than a reduction of cost of goods sold. In addition, the portion of the funds applied to cost of goods sold will now be spread between the first and second quarters.
 While this change has no impact on the full year, operating expenses will now be inflated by about 55 basis points in the first quarter relative to the other quarters. Gross profit will now be inflated by about 35 basis points in the first quarter and 20 basis points in the second quarter. There is no impact to operating margin.
 Gross profit margins. We expect gross profit margins to be down 50 to 70 basis points for full year 2016 versus the full year 2015, primarily driven by the ongoing foreign exchange deterioration in Canada. For the first quarter, we forecast gross profit margins to be -- will be down 175 to 225 basis points versus the 2015 first quarter, reflecting the change in accounting for supplier funding, which has an effect of about 70 basis points and the expectation of lower performance in Canada.
 Operating margin. For the full year, we now expect operating margin will be down 40 to 150 basis points, driven by 2015 results that were better than our November guidance, including the $0.16 per share of nonrepeating operating benefits and lower 2016 expectations for Canada.
 For the first quarter, we forecast operating margins will be down 175 to 225 basis points versus the 2015 first quarter due primarily to lower gross profit margins as mentioned above. The supplier funding changes have no effect on operating margins.
 Branch closures. As previously announced, we will continue to adjust the U.S. branch network in 2016 and plan to close 55 branches this year. Total restructuring costs are in line with the guidance given at the analyst meeting on November 12, 2015.
 Clean energy investment. Our first investment in clean energy resulted in a benefit of $0.09 per share for the full year 2015. Earlier this month, we entered into a second clean energy investment. As a result, we now expect a $0.15 to $0.20 per share of benefit to EPS in 2016 from the 2 investments. We expect the new investment will lower our effective tax rate by 250 to 300 basis points as reflected in our updated tax rate guidance.
 Earnings per share. As compared to our November guidance, we expect to receive a $0.15 per share benefit in 2016 from a lower share count and the tax benefit from the second clean energy investment. However, that will essentially offset the timing of SAP spending and lower performance in Canada.
 Please mark your calendar for the release of January sales on Thursday, February 11. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. And if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at (847) 535-0409; Michael Ferreter at (847)535-1439; or me, Bill Chapman, at (847)535-0881.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-16 07:30:00) =====

Operator:
Laura Brown: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2015 third quarter results. To supplement this podcast, please also reference our 2015 third quarter earnings release issued today October 16th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations Website. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions, and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our SEC filings including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q which are available on our investor relations website for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. I’d like to begin by providing some context regarding the current environment for industrial companies. We’ve talked about the impact of oil and gas prices, the strong U.S. dollar and China’s economic slowdown on our performance. In addition, the performance of the following key indicators over the past 12 months further illustrates these challenges. The ISM purchasing managers index was 50.2 in September down versus last year indicating an economy no longer in expansion mode overall. The industrial production index has fallen for most of the year as well. The Canadian dollar has fallen 21%, copper prices are down 22%, cold roll steel prices are down 25%, and crude oil prices are down 60%. The drop in the price of raw materials underscores the weak demand environment and oversupply of commodities and in many cases the weakness has sped up in the past three months. As these economic indicators decline, we’ve seen that downturn take hold in the industrial economy. In response, we have begun the process of bringing our cost structure in line with current trends and activity levels. We announced the closure of 26 branches and eliminated 170 field positions in the United States. In Canada, we have eliminated more than 100 roles and closed four branches since the beginning of June. We have substantially completed the closure of our business in Brazil. We continue to restructure our Fabory business in Europe which is expected to be completed this year. And we decided to transition our business in Costa Rica from a local branch based model to being served via our U.S. based export operations. These actions resulted in $0.11 charged earnings per share in the quarter. You can expect more actions in the fourth quarter and into next year. At the same time we took advantage of our strong financial position to invest in the future growth and performance of the business as follows. We added more than a 100 sales representatives in the third quarter and 300 year-to-date to better serve and penetrate large customers. We created a team to focus solely on our medium sized business. We acquired Cromwell Group Holdings Limited in the U.K. to further our growth in attractive MRO markets and leverage our internet expertise. We took advantage of our improved capital structure and weakness in the stock market to aggressively buy back stock and we have made investments that lower our tax rate. You can expect us to share additional information at our analyst meeting on November 12. So let’s take a look at our 2015 third quarter results and our revised sales and earnings guidance. Please note that the following analysis excludes the $0.11 per share of charges unless specifically noted. Please see exhibit one for detail on these charges. Company sales declined 1%, operating earnings were down 9%, net earnings decreased 13% reflecting higher interest expense. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.03 for the quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the 2014 third quarter. Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement on an adjusted basis. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 110 basis points to 41.9%, versus 43% in 2014, primarily driven by faster growth with lower margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to volume than expected volume and price deflation versus slight cost inflation due to the higher cost of imported U.S. sourced products for the business in Canada. Operating expenses excluding charges were down 1% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits and included $43 million in incremental growth in infrastructure related spending versus the 2014 third quarter. The company operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 13.9% versus 15% in the prior year primarily due to lower gross profit margins. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items. As I mentioned, total company sales for the quarter were down 1%. The sales performance included 2 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from unfavourable foreign exchange, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat consisting of 1 percentage point from volume and a one percentage point decline from price. By month, daily sales declined 1% in July, 2% in August and were flat in September. Sales in September included a 4 percentage point contribution from Cromwell. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments: the United States, and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled “Other Businesses”. Sales in the U.S. segment which accounted for 78% of total company revenues in the quarter were flat. This comprised of one percentage point from inter-company sales to Zoro, and a one percentage point decline from price. Daily sales increased 1% in July, were flat in August and declined 2% in September. Let’s review U.S. sales performance by customer and market for the quarter. Commercial, light manufacturing, retail and government were up in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits. Heavy manufacturing and reseller were down in the mid-single digits and natural resources were down in the high teens. Low oil prices continue to affect our natural resources and heavy manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. Now, let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter and decreased 23% down 8% in local currency. The 8% sales decrease consisted of 17 percentage point decline from volume, partially offset by 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 5 percentage points from price. Sales performance in Canada was driven by declines in the construction, oil and gas, retail, commercial, transportation, government and heavy and light manufacturing end markets. By month, daily sales in local currency declined 4% in July, 7% in August and 13% in September. We also lapped the acquisition of WFS Enterprises Incorporated on September 2. Let’s wrap up our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the other businesses. The other businesses represented 14% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for these groups were up 18% and consisted of 12 percentage points of growth from the Cromwell acquisition and 22 percentage points from volume and price partially offset by a 16 percentage point decline from unfavourable foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and in the United States. Earlier in the quarter, reported sales results for July and August, and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September 2015, the same as the prior year. Company sales were flat in September of 2015 versus September of 2014. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. September was the first month to include sales from Cromwell and we left the WFS acquisition. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange organic sales declined 1% primarily driven by lower volume. In the United States, September sales declined 2% which included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales to Zoro. Let’s review sales performance by customer end market in the United States for the month of September. Government was up in the mid-single digits, light manufacturing and commercial were up in the low single digits, retail was down in the low-single digits, contractor re-seller and heavy manufacturing was down in the mid single digits, natural resources was down in the low 20s. In the government end market, we saw strong performance from state customers as we focussed on two large departments of state budgets. The department of corrections and the department of transportation. For the month of September the direct and indirect effect of the energy sector accelerated to a 2% drag on sales. Sales in Canada for September declined 28% in U.S. dollars and were down 13% in local currency. The 13% decrease consisted of an 18 percentage point decrease from volume partially offset by 5 percentage points from price. On an organic basis sales performance was driven by declines in the construction, oil and gas, commercial, light and heavy manufacturing, retail and transportation end markets partially offset by growth in the utilities, government, mining and forestry end markets. Sales for our other businesses increased 40% in September consisting of 36 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition and 18 percentage points from volume and price partially offset by a 14 percentage point drag from unfavourable foreign exchange from the other businesses. Similar to the quarter, organic sales growth in September was driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and the United States. Daily sales in the month of October are currently down in the low single digits including the benefit from Cromwell. Excluding Cromwell sales performance is currently down in the mid single digits. As a reminder, October 2014 included 1% of sales from Ebola-related products. Now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reportable segment. As a reminder, all the figures exclude the $0.11 per share of charges unless specifically noted. Operating earnings in the United States decreased 5% versus the 2014 third quarter. This performance was driven by lower gross profit margins partially offset by lower operating expenses. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 120 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by price deflation exceeding cost deflation and higher sales to Zoro reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these intercompany sales. Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 90 basis points versus the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 2% in the quarter versus the prior year. Expenses were driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits which were partially offset by incremental growth and infrastructure spending of $30 million. The operating margin for the U.S. segment decreased 80 basis points to 18.1% versus 18.9% in the prior year. In the absence of the growth spending we realized attractive operating leverage. Let's move on to results for our business in Canada, adjusted for restructuring. Operating earnings were down 83% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The lower operating performance was primarily the result of lower sales, lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses as a percent of sales driven by incremental cost from the WFS acquisition and SAP implementation. Gross profit margins declined 130 basis points primarily due to unfavourable foreign exchange from products from U.S. based supplier in the lower margins at WFS, partially offset by price increases. The operating margin in Canada for the third quarter was 2.2% versus 9.9% in the prior year. Incremental cost from the SAP implementation were $6 million in U.S. dollars, excluding SAP cost operating earnings were down 61% in U.S. dollars and the operating margin was 5%. On an adjusted basis the other businesses generated $15 million in operating earnings in the 2015 third quarter versus $5 million in the 2014 third quarter. The operating earnings increase for the quarter versus the prior year was driven by strong results from the single channel businesses in Japan and the United States and included a $2 million contribution from Cromwell, partially offset by an incremental $2 million in start up cost for the single channel online business in Europe. Other income and expense was a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter versus a net $3 million expense in the 2014 third quarter. The increase in expense was driven by $12 million in higher net interest expense and $6 million in losses on the company’s clean energy investment. The incremental $12 million in net interest expense was driven by the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in June to buy back company shares. Beyond 2015, the company intends to issue new permanent debt of $400 million in both 2016 and 2017 to continue the share buyback program as announced in April. Our investment in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy generated a loss of $6 million in the quarter. As part of supporting the operations of this entity, Grainger receives its share of energy tax credits. For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a reduction of approximately 1.3 percentage point in the company’s effective tax rate. The company’s tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% compared to 39.1% in the 2014 third quarter. The lower tax rate in 2015 reflects the benefit of the energy tax credits partially offset by a higher proportion of earnings from the United States versus other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year 2015. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $366 million versus $329 million in 2014. The company used the cash generated and cash on hand to invest in the business and return cash to shareholder through share repurchases and dividend. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $82 million versus $84 million in 2014. Our full year capital spending range is now $300 million to $350 million driven by postponing the construction of a new Edmonton distribution centre, moving SAP in Canada to 2016 and the timing of other supply chain infrastructure projects. We paid dividends of $77 million, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. In addition, we bought back 3.4 million shares of stock for $735 million and ended the quarter with 10.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $82 million to shareholders in the quarter. As reported in our 2015 third quarter earnings release, we lowered our sales and earnings guidance for the year given the performance to date and the expectation of continued economic weakness. With the change in the industrial economy, our guidance reflects what we’re seeing in our customers’ business. Let's take a look at our current expectations. All figures include Cromwell and all comparisons are to prior year unless otherwise noted. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, we now expect sales growth in the range of down 0.5% to up 0.5%. Excluding Cromwell, we expect sales to be down 2% to down 1%. For the fourth quarter, the new guidance implies a sales range of down 3% to up 0.5% sales growth. Excluding Cromwell, we expect sales to be down 7% to down 4% in the quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we are up against difficult comps as 2014 included a 1 percentage point lift from sales of Ebola-related safety products. Let's move to gross profit margins. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin contraction of about 80 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to decrease 150 basis points. The price deflation and the mix of faster growth with lower-margin customers are driving the decrease. The Cromwell acquisition also contributes lower gross profit margins by 20 basis points. Let's take a look at operating margins, which are adjusted to exclude charges. Keep in mind these margins are inclusive of the gross profit factors discussed above. For the full year we expect operating margin contraction of 85 basis points to 100 basis points. This includes incremental growth and infrastructure spending for the year at the high end of our range, as detailed in Exhibit 4. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting operating margin contraction of 195 basis points to 250 basis points. The contraction in gross margin drives most of the change, with the lack of operating expense leverage a factor based on a more conservative view of sales volume. Cromwell represents about a 50 basis point drag on operating margin in the quarter, due to mix and eCommerce-related investments. Next, the tax rate. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year and for the 2015 fourth quarter. This range is higher than we forecasted in July because earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions represent a lower percentage of total company earnings. Clean energy investments are expected to contribute $0.09 per share to earnings for the full year. Please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On Thursday, November 12th, we plan to release October sales, and we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting at our headquarters in Lake Forest. On Tuesday, November 17th, Will Lomax, Vice President and Controller, and Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations, will participate in the Barclays Select Series: Industrial Distribution Forum in New York City.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-17 07:30:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown - SVP, Communications and IR Bill Chapman - Senior Director, IR
Analysts:
Laura Brown: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2015 second quarter results. Please also reference our 2015 second quarter earnings release issued on July 17th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations Web site to supplement this podcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions, and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Today we reported results for the 2015 second quarter, and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year. We delivered a solid quarter from an EPS standpoint. And while our gross profit margin was less than we expected, we were able to generate positive cost leverage as an offset. I'd like to share with you what we are seeing in the market. We remain in a soft demand environment. Deflationary commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the economy in Canada continue to be headwinds. Despite all of this, we continue to gain share with customers who value a broad product offering, inventory management services, technical services, and fast, reliable delivery. In addition, we are growing rapidly with small customers through Zoro, and MonotaRO. And we remain focused on productivity to fund our growth and infrastructure investments and reduce the effect of lower gross profit margins. Last month, we announced that D.G. Macpherson will assume the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer, effective August 1st. We expect this move will ensure tighter coordination between operating functions, business units, and business models. Also last month, we issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt. We are using the proceeds as part of our $3 billion share buyback program announced on April 16th. Before we begin the review of results, I'd like to remind you that there were adjustments to reported results in the second quarters of both 2015 and '14. In 2015, we took $0.02 per share in charges related to restructuring at Fabory, and the shutdown of the Brazil business. In 2014, we recorded a $0.15 per share charge related to the transition of Fabory's employee retirement plan in Europe. During the 2015 second quarter, Grainger invested in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy. In addition to supporting the operations of this entity, we receive a pro rata share of energy tax credits. Tax credits earned net of operating losses from this investment lowered the company's effective tax rate in the 2015 second quarter, and contributed approximately $0.09 per share to earnings. For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a 1.4 percentage point reduction in the company's effective tax rate. With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2015 second quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 1% versus the 2014 second quarter. Excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, organic sales increased 3%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Reported operating earnings increased 5% or 1% adjusted. Reported net earnings increased 7%, and adjusted net earnings were up 3%. Reported earnings per share were $3.25 for the quarter, an increase of 11% versus the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the adjustments from both years, earnings per share were $3.27, up 6% versus the prior year. We also revised guidance for sales and earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of the podcast. Our 2015 guidance issued on April 16, 2015, included 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $12.25 to $12.95. We now expect 2015 sales growth of zero to 2%, and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50, which includes the benefit of the energy tax credits. Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 50 basis points to 42.6%, versus 43.1% in 2014, due primarily to faster growth with lower gross margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to volume and price deflation versus cost inflation driven by foreign exchange. Operating expenses for the company declined 3%, driven by lower payroll and benefits. The company generated $28 million of productivity savings to fund $25 million of incremental growth in infrastructure spending. Total company operating earnings were $357 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. The reported operating margin was 14.1%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the prior year. The adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior year. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we used the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 1%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: up 1% in April, flat in May, and up 1% in June. Results for the quarter included one percentage point from acquisitions, and a three percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions in foreign exchange, organic sales increased 3%, driven by four percentage points from volume, partially offset by a one percentage point decline in price. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments: the United States, and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 2%. Results for the quarter included two percentage points from volume, and one percentage point from inter-company sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a one percentage point decline from price. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government, commercial, and light manufacturing were up in the mid single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits. Heavy manufacturing and contractor were down in the low single digits. Reseller was down in the high single digits, and natural resources was down in the low teens. Low oil prices continue to affect our natural resources and heavy manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. Now, let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 9% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales increased 2% in local currency, and declined 9% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The 2% sales increase consisted of eight percentage points from the WFS acquisition and four points from price. This was partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline in volume. Based on our estimates, we believe the vast majority of the volume decline is attributable to direct and indirect exposure to oil and gas. On an organic basis, declines during the quarter in the commercial, oil and gas, retail, construction, heavy manufacturing, forestry, and transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the government, mining, utilities, and light manufacturing end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 18%, compared to all other provinces, which were up 3% in aggregate. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the other businesses, which represented 13% of total company sales. Sales for the other businesses increased 7%, consisting of 21 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S., and MonotaRO, and also the business in Mexico. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May, and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2015, versus 21 days in the same month of 2014. Daily sales increased 1% in June versus the prior year. The daily sales increase included one percentage point from acquisitions, and a three percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions in foreign exchange, organic daily sales increased 3%, driven by four percentage points from volume, partially offset by a one percentage point decline from price. In the United States, June daily sales increased 3%, driven by three percentage points from volume and one percentage point from inter-company sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a one percentage point decline from price. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light manufacturing, government, retail, and commercial were up in the mid single digits. Heavy manufacturing and contractor were down in the low single digits. Reseller was down in the high single digits, and natural resources was down in the low teens. Low oil prices continue to affect our natural resources and heavy manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the month. Daily sales in Canada, for June, were up 1% in local currency, and declined 11% in U.S. dollars. The local currency increase was driven by eight percentage points from the WFS acquisition, and four percentage points from price, partially offset by an 11 percentage point decrease in volume. As a reminder, we will anniversary the WFS acquisition on September 2, 2015. In Canada, on an organic basis declines during the month in the commercial, oil and gas, retail, construction, heavy manufacturing, forestry, light manufacturing, and transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the government, mining, and utilities end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 17%, compared to all other provinces [ph], which reflect to the prior year in aggregate. Daily sales for our other businesses increased 6% in June, consisting of 20 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point's decrease from foreign exchange. The daily sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., Japan, and Mexico. Sales growth in the month of July is currently trending slightly below the growth rate reported for June. Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's talk about performance by reportable segment. In the United States, gross profit margins for the quarter declined 70 basis points, primarily driven by faster growth with larger customers, higher sales to Zoro, reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these inter-segment sales, and price deflation exceeding cost deflation. Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 40 basis points versus the prior year. Operating expenses were down slightly in the quarter, driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits, which offset incremental growth and infrastructure spending of $23 million. Operating earnings for the U.S. segment increased 1% in the quarter, driven by the 2% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins. We also wanted to provide a midyear update on our growth initiatives in the United States. Year-to-date, we have hired 80 sales representatives with a plan to hire several hundred total by year end. Most of the new sellers will call on our large customers where we see additional opportunity to gain share. In addition, ecommerce represented 40% of sales in the first half of the year, up from 35% in the first half of 2014. Let's move on to our business in Canada. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 110 basis points versus the prior year, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States, and inventory markdowns related to the Toronto D.C. move, partially offset by price increases, and higher freight revenue. Excluding WFS, gross profit margins were down 30 basis points. Operating earnings in Canada declined 51% in the 2015 second quarter, driven by the 9% sales decline, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage. Because of the affect of foreign exchange, we wanted to also share Canada's results in local currency. Operating expenses in Canada increased 10% in local currency due to the WFS acquisition, relocation to the new Toronto distribution center and SAP implementation cost. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2014, we wrote off $4 million of capitalized software development costs. Operating earnings in Canada were down 44% in local currency, representing a 330 basis point decline in operating margin. We have taken measured actions primarily in Alberta to reduce headcounts and freeze open roles. Operating earnings in the other businesses were $15 million in the 2015 second quarter, which included $2 million of restructuring charges. Operating earnings in the 2014 second quarter were essentially breakeven, which included $14 million for the retirement plan transition in Europe, and $2 million for the write off of capitalized software development costs for Mexico. Adjusting for these items, earnings increased $2 million versus the prior year. The results included strong performance for Zoro U.S. and Japan, and also included an incremental $3 million in expense for the single channel online business in Europe. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter versus a net $2 million expense in the 2014 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense associated with the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in early June bearing an interest rate of 4.6%. In addition, the investment in clean energy made during the quarter generated losses that contributed to the increase in other expense. Accounting guidance requires us to record the tax credit provision based on a full year estimate of the annual rate applied to the year-to-date earnings. Accordingly, the 2015 second quarter includes the benefit of half the annual energy tax credits anticipated for the year. When netted against the losses generated in the quarter, the energy investment generated $6.4 million or $0.09 per share of earnings. On a full year basis, the expected impact is also $0.9 of earnings per share. The full year estimate takes into consideration the forecasted operating loss from the date of investment, associated tax benefits, and the tax credits expected for the year. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% compared to 38.2% in the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the benefits of the energy tax credits for the first quarter of 2015 recorded in the second quarter, the tax rate for the 2015 second quarter was 36.9%. In comparison, the 2014 second quarter reflected a higher tax rate due to the effect of the retirement plan transition in Europe. Excluding the retirement plan transition cost, the tax rate was 37.7% in the 2014 second quarter. The company expects to benefit from the energy tax credits going forward, and is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 36.6% to 37.2% for 2015. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $213 million versus $161 million in 2014. On April 16, 2015, the company announced a plan to repurchase $3 billion of stock over the next three years. In June, the company issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt to fund part of the share repurchase program. The net EPS impact of the buyback in the quarter was negative by $0.01 as the borrowing cost exceeded the share repurchase benefit. We continue to expect $0.08-$0.12 per share benefit for the full year. We bought back 1.3 million shares of stock for $293 million in the second quarter, and ended the quarter with 13.7 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Grainger returned to a total $373 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $80 million in dividends, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April 2015. Capital expenditures were $71 million in the quarter versus $90 million in the second quarter of 2014. While we still anticipate full year capital spending of $375 million to $425 million, we are likely to be at the low end of that range. Spending will be back-half weighted as the investment in the new distribution centre in the Northeast picks up. As reported in our 2015 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2015 sales and earnings per share guidance to reflect a softer top-line, lower growth profit margins, and a lower effective tax rate. For the full year 2015, we now expect zero to 2% sales growth, and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50. This guidance assumes incremental growth spending of $150 million, although we are currently assessing our spending plan for the back-half of the year given the tenure of business. Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We will begin with sales. We now expect sales to be flat to up 2%. This compares to our April guidance of 1% to 4% and reflects a weaker economy and lower than expected sales in oil and gas, and heavy manufacturing in both the United States and Canada. We have also revised our full year price realization estimate to negative 1% versus flat, given the current deflationary environment. From an organic gross perspective, the midpoint of our sales guidance anticipates second half sales consistent with our second quarter results. The low end of our sales guidance at zero is based on further weakness in the economy, oil and gas, and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and as a reminder, we anniversary the WFS acquisition at the beginning of September. Moving on to gross profit margins; for the full year we now expect gross profit margins to be down about 60 basis points. For the back-half of 2015, we are expecting gross profit margins to contract about 60 to 80 basis points versus 2014. Gross profit margin compression in the second half is slightly worse than the second quarter as we lap prior year pricing actions. Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we expect our operating margin to be down between 40 and 70 basis points depending on volume. Growth and infrastructure investments will continue with the expectation of fueling market share gains. In the back-half of the year, we intend to drive continue productivity and manage expenses to fund the incremental growth in infrastructure spending. However, margins versus the second half of 2014 are forecasted to decline 90 to 110 basis points, primarily due to the anticipation of back-half weighted gross spending. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information. The other interest and expense section of the income statement will look dramatically different going forward. Interest expense will increase in the second half of the year due to the new $1 billion debt offering, which carries a 4.6% interest rate. Also the loss from the clean energy investment is expected to be $9 to $11 million per quarter for the third and fourth quarters. Finally, earnings per share; as noted in our revised guidance, we now expect EPS of $12 to $12.50, reflecting the headwinds from the economy and the expected margin compression from lower gross profit margins, and continued growth in infrastructure spending, partially offset by our productivity programs. As a reminder, similar to April guidance, our new EPS guidance reflects the benefit of the $0.8 to $0.12 of accretion from the $1 billion in incremental share repurchases in 2015, all of which should be realized in the back-half of the year. Finally, our EPS guidance includes the lower tax rate of 36.6% to 37.2% for the full year. Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates: On August 13th, we plan to release July sales. On August 19th, Paul Miller, Vice President of Global eCommerce, Customer Information and Innovation will present at the ITG Industrial Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And finally, we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on November 12th, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-16 07:30:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown - Senior Vice President, Communications and IR Bill Chapman - Senior Director, Investor Relations
Analysts:
Laura Brown: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger’s First Quarter 2015 Results. Please reference our 2015 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 16th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this podcast. Today we also announced a permanent change to our capital structure and our intent to buy back $3 billion in stock by the end of 2017. In just a moment, we will provide some additional commentary regarding this important communication. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Our capital structure announcement details our plan to repurchase $3 billion of our stock over the next three years. This represents approximately 19% of today’s market capitalization. Year to date, we have purchased $150 million in shares. The additional repurchases will be funded with a combination of $1.2 billion of internally generated cash and $1.8 billion of new, permanent debt over the next three years. Here are some important points to keep in mind. The cost of debt is at historic lows. The issuance of permanent debt will increase the efficiency of our balance sheet and will lower our cost of capital. We expect to issue $1 billion in long-term debt in June to help fund the program. Our new target debt ratio of 1.0 to 1.5 times EBITDA was chosen specifically to preserve our access to the Tier 1 commercial paper market. The timing, size and structure of the share repurchase and debt issuance is flexible enough to allow for continued investment in the business, while being meaningful to the equity markets. We fully intend to continue our 43-year track record of increasing our dividend. Finally, the repurchase will be EPS accretive. The incremental $1 billion in repurchases, beyond the $400 million previously announced, should add $0.08 to $0.12 earnings per share in 2015. Let’s move on to our quarterly results. Today we reported our 2015 first quarter. Our performance was characterized by continued share gain in our U.S. business and in our single channel online businesses. At the same time, the strength of the U.S. dollar represented a significant headwind to our topline growth, as did our direct and indirect exposure to the oil and gas sectors in North America. With no evidence of any change to this pattern in sight, we have adjusted our full year guidance. At the end of this recording, we’ll talk in more detail about our expectations and assumptions for the full year 2015. Let’s begin with an overview of the quarter. Company sales increased 2%. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, the same as in the previous year. Operating earnings declined 1% and net earnings were down 3%. Earnings per share of $3.07 were flat versus the previous year. Results included $0.02 per share in charges related to the previously announced shutdown of the business in Brazil and $0.01 per share in charges for restructuring Fabory in Europe. Excluding these charges, earnings per share increased 1% to $3.10. Let’s now walk down the operating section in the income statement in more detail. Reported gross profit margins decreased 0.3 percentage point versus the prior year to 44.8% driven by lower gross profit margins in the Canadian segment and the Other Businesses. Company operating earnings declined 1% versus the 2014 quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by the performance of the business in Canada reflecting continued headwinds from the economy due to exposure to oil and gas, coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange. Operating expenses for the company increased 3% and included $33 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and in the month of March, second, operating performance by segment, third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales. Company sales for the quarter increased 2%. The 2% sales growth included 1 percentage point from acquisitions, namely WFS Enterprises Incorporated acquired in September of 2014 in Canada, and a 3 percentage points reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4% driven exclusively by volume growth. By month, total daily sales growth was as follows, 3% in January, 2% in February and 1% in March. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Our Other Businesses also include results from our single channel online businesses in Japan, MonotaRO, the United States, Zoro and Europe. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 4%. The sales growth was driven by 2 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola related safety products and 1 percentage point from higher sales to Zoro, the single channel online business in the United States. By month, daily sales increased 4% in January, 4% in February and 4% in March. Let’s review sales performance by customer end market for the quarter in the United States. Commercial was up in the high single digits driven by strong performance in the Healthcare sector, Light Manufacturing, Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits, Heavy Manufacturing was up in the low single digits, Contractor was down in the low single digits and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-single digits. Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 10% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a challenging economy given the country’s exposure to oil and gas. Results reported in U.S. dollars are further affected by the stronger U.S. dollar. Sales for our business in Canada declined 8% in the quarter were up 3% in local currency. The 3% sales increase in local currency consisted of 7 percentage points from WFS and 2 percentage points from price. This growth was partially offset by a 5 percentage points decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. The 5% volume decline for the quarter was primarily driven by lower sales to the Oil and Gas, Construction, Reseller, Commercial, Retail and Heavy Manufacturing customer end markets partially offset by growth to customers in the Utilities, Light Manufacturing, Transportation, Forestry, Mining and Government customer end markets. On a geographic basis, sales in the province of Alberta, which represents more than a third of the company’s business in Canada, was down in the mid-teens in local currency. Local currency sales for all provinces except Alberta and British Columbia were up versus the prior year. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 6% in January, 1% in February and 2% in March. Let’s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. This group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America, and represents about 12% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 8%, 21% in local currency consisting of volume and price. The sales increase was primarily due to sales growth in our single channel online businesses in the United States and Japan, as well as our multichannel business in Mexico. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February, and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let’s now take a look at March. There were 22 selling days in March of 2015, one more than in 2014. Company daily sales increased 1% versus March of 2014. Sales results in March included 1 percentage point from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic daily sales increased 3% driven by 4 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price. We also benefited from modest cost deflation, which helped mitigate the negative price realization in the United States. Price increases in Canada offset inflation from a weaker Canadian dollar on U.S. imports. In the United States, daily sales in March increased 4%. This increase was due to a 5 percentage point increase in volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price. March customer end market performance in the United States was as follows. Commercial was up in the high single digits, driven by strong sales to customers in the Healthcare sector, Light Manufacturing was up in the mid-single digits, Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Government were up in the low single digits, Contractor was down in the low single digits, Reseller was down in the mid-single digits and Natural Resources was down in the low double digits. Daily sales in Canada for March were down 9%, but were up 2% in local currency. The 2% daily sales increase consisted of 6 percentage points from WFS and 3 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 6 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. The volume decline was driven by lower sales to the Oil and Gas, Contractor, Commercial, Government, Heavy Manufacture and Retail customer end markets, partially offset by growth in the Utilities, Light Manufacturing, Transportation, Mining and Forestry customer end markets. On a geographic basis, sales performance in Canada was driven by softness in the province of Alberta, which represents slightly more than a third of our sales in Canada and was down mid-teens in local currency in March. Daily sales in March for our Other Businesses increased 3%, 18% in local currency. The 18% daily sales growth in the Other Businesses was primarily driven by Zoro U.S. along with strong growth from the businesses in Japan and Mexico. Looking ahead to April, daily sales growth to-date is running in line with the sales growth reported for March. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Thanks Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let’s move right into results by reportable segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 4% versus the 2014 first quarter, with operating margins flat at 18.6%. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 40 basis points driven by higher sales to Zoro U.S., reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these intersegment sales. Excluding Zoro U.S., gross profit margins were flat versus the prior year. Operating expenses for the U.S. segment increased 3% and included $22 million in incremental growth and infrastructure-related spending. Let’s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 56% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by the 8% sales decline, unfavorable foreign exchange, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage. Gross profit margins in Canada declined 70 basis points versus the prior year, due to lower gross profit margins at WFS. Excluding WFS, gross profit margins were flat versus the prior year as price increases and higher freight revenue were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. The Canadian business increased prices in the first quarter to offset unfavorable foreign exchange rates on product sourced from the United States. Despite the headwinds in Canada, we continue to invest in the business through this difficult macroeconomic environment to strengthen our operations and better position the business for the long-term. The Other Businesses generated $10 million in operating earnings in the 2015 quarter versus $8 million in 2014. This performance was primarily driven by strong results from Zoro in United States and MonotaRO in Japan, along with reduced losses in China. In addition, costs associated with the previously announced shutdown of the business in Brazil and planned restructuring expenses for Fabory in Europe partially offset earnings for the Other Businesses in the quarter and are expected continue into the second half of 2015. The charges related to Brazil and Fabory resulted in a reduction in earnings per share of approximately $0.02 and $0.01 per share in the quarter, respectively, and are excluded from company guidance. For the full year, planned shutdown costs for Brazil and restructuring costs for Fabory are estimated to be $0.09 and $0.04 per share, respectively. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net expense of $4 million in the 2015 first quarter versus $3 million in the 2014 first quarter. This $1 million increase was primarily the result of higher foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest income from lower average cash balances. For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2015 was 38.4% versus 37.7% in 2014. The increase was primarily due to more earnings in the United States relative to other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We are still projecting an effective tax rate of 37.7% to 38.8% for the full year 2015. Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $156 million in the 2015 first quarter versus $168 million in the 2014 first quarter. The company used the cash generated, along with cash on hand, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures were $99 million in the 2015 first quarter versus $66 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in capital expenditures versus prior year was attributable to investments in our distribution network, primarily the distribution center in the Northeast United States and IT-related spending. We returned $223 million to shareholders through $73 million in dividends and $150 million to buyback 634,000 shares of stock. Now let’s take a look at guidance. As reported in our first quarter earnings release, we lowered our 2015 sales and earnings per share guidance. There are three primary factors contributing to this change. First, the weakness in oil and gas prices will dampen the industrial economy in North America, reducing our expectations for macroeconomic growth. Second, despite softness in the U.S. economy, we see share gain opportunities with large customers and instead of hiring 200 new sales representatives in 2015, we now plan to add 400. Admittedly, this will create expense headwinds in the near-term in addition to lower expense leverage on lower sales volume, but it will ultimately help Grainger extend its advantaged position in the MRO marketplace. In addition, many of our cost productivity projects are delivering at or above plan, mitigating some of the lost expense leverage. Accordingly, we now expect approximately $150 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending for the full year of 2015 versus the $130 million midpoint originally forecasted. The $150 million estimate represents the high end of the growth and infrastructure spending range. Lastly, we updated EPS guidance for the accretion from $1 billion of additional share repurchases now planned in 2015. We now expect 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $12.25 to $12.95. Let’s look more closely at the underlying elements of our expectations versus normalized results in 2014. We’ll begin with sales. We now expect sales growth of 1% to 4%, down from 3% to 7%, reflecting reduction of 100 basis points from a weaker economy and 100 basis points from lower than expected sales from the multichannel model, primarily in Canada. We have also revised our full year price realization estimate to zero percent given the current environment. Moving on to gross profit margins, for the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be flat to down as much as 20 basis points. For the 2015 second quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to expand or contract as much as 10 basis points versus 2014. Please keep in mind as you model margins for the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our first quarter included supplier support for our annual customer trade shows and as a result, both gross profit margins and operating expenses as a percent of sales are inflated by about 100 basis points. Let’s take a closer look at operating margin expectations. In 2015, we anticipate operating margin to be flat to down as much as 40 basis points versus 2014. As our guidance implies, given our commitment to growth and infrastructure investments, we lose operating leverage below about 4% sales growth. For the 2015 second quarter, margins are forecasted to decline 25 to 45 basis points versus the 2014 second quarter due to the anticipated incremental growth and infrastructure spending in the second quarter. Please see Exhibit 3 for more information. Finally, earnings per share, as noted in our revised guidance, we now expect EPS of $12.25 to $12.95, reflecting the headwinds from the economy and the incremental sales force hires, partially offset by the success of our productivity programs and expected accretion from the $1 billion in incremental share repurchases in 2015. So to conclude please mark your calendar for the following upcoming events. On April 29th we will host our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The script from that meeting will be available on our website following the event. On May 6th, Court Carruthers, Senior Vice President and Group President, Americas, will present at the Robert W. Baird Growth Stock Conference in Chicago. The event will be webcast. We plan to report April sales information on May 13th. And finally, on May 20th, Jim Ryan and Ron Jadin will present at the Electrical Products Group Meeting in Longboat Key, Florida. This event will also be webcast. We appreciate your support and thank you for your interest in Grainger. If you have any questions, please contact Laura Brown at (847) 535-0409, Casey Darby at (847) 535-0099 or me Bill Chapman at (847) 535-0881. Thank you.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-01-26 07:30:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown - Senior Vice President, Communications & Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations
Analysts:
Laura Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger’s Fourth Quarter 2014 Results. Please also reference our 2014 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 26th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast. As a reminder, certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. As mentioned in the press release, we lowered our 2015 guidance to reflect the 10% weakening in the Canadian dollar since our Analyst Meeting in November. To put this in perspective, Canada is our second largest business behind the United States, representing 11% of total company sales in 2014. Roughly 20% of our Canadian sales are tied directly to the oil and gas industry. Beyond our direct exposure, the Canadian economy and the Canadian dollar tend to correlate closely with natural resources prices, more specifically oil. Because of this, we have taken a fresh look at our expected performance in Canada based on current exchange rates and the weaker economy. As a result, we now expect 2015 sales growth of 3% to 7% and earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.60. Our 2015 guidance issued on November 12th, 2014, called for sales growth of 5% to 9% and earnings per share of $12.90 to $13.80. At the end of the podcast, we will provide more color around the revised guidance. Before we analyze our results, let’s review some highlights from full year 2014. We saw continued strong performance in the United States with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 18.2%. As promised, we took actions to address several smaller underperforming businesses. Our single channel online model continued its strong growth. And, we spent an incremental $78 million on growth and infrastructure and $387 million in gross capital spending to create long-term competitive advantage. With that as a backdrop, let’s now take a look at our performance. Today we reported results for the year 2014. For the full year, company sales increased 6% to $10 billion. Net earnings increased 1% to $802 million and earnings per share increased 3% to $11.45. As described in the earnings release, the fourth quarter contained restructuring and impairment charges that lowered reported earnings by $0.66 per share. To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of charges in 2014 and 2013. Details regarding the charges can be found in the earnings release, posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. Excluding charges from 2014 and 2013, company operating earnings increased 6% for the year, while net earnings increased 4%. Adjusted earnings per share were $12.26 for the year, representing a 6% increase versus $11.52 in 2013. Adjusted EPS grew faster than net earnings due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchases. Now let’s turn to the 2014 fourth quarter. Overall, results were within the expectations issued at our Analyst Meeting on November 12th. Company sales in the fourth quarter increased 6%. Excluding the charges from 2014 and 2013, operating earnings increased 9%, while net earnings increased 6%. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.80 for the quarter, representing an increase of 8% versus the 2013 fourth quarter. Let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Adjusted gross profit margins were 42.5%, flat with the 2013 fourth quarter due to improvement in the United States, offset by gross profit declines in Canada and Fabory in Europe. On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter increased 9%. The earnings growth was driven by the 6% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Adjusted operating expenses grew 4%, including $10 million in incremental growth related spending. Throughout the year, we continued to invest in growth and infrastructure designed to accelerate our share gains and increase our size and scale. Incremental growth spending for the full year 2014 was $78 million versus 2013. A schedule summarizing incremental growth spending for 2011 through 2015 can be found in Exhibit 3 of this podcast. Adjusted company operating margins increased 40 basis points to 12.7% for the quarter from 12.3% a year ago. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far. Second, operating performance by segment. Third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 6%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 6% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 7 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola related safety products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1 percentage point negative variance from lapping an extra month of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 from E&R Industrial, Incorporated. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses and also include results for the single channel online model businesses in Japan, the United States and Europe. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 6%. The 6% sales growth for the quarter was driven by 6 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola related safety products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 1 percentage point negative variance from the divestiture of several Specialty Brands on December 31st, 2013. Let’s review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Commercial and Natural Resources were up in the low double-digits, Light Manufacturing was up in the high single digits, Government and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the mid-single digits, Retail and Reseller were up in the low single digits, and Contractor was down in the low single digits. For perspective, Natural Resources represents approximately 4% of sales in the U.S. segment, with sales growth driven by Oil & Gas and Refining & Mining customers. The strong performance in Commercial was driven by sales of Ebola related safety products to healthcare customers. Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 3% in US dollars, 11% in local currency. The 11% sales increase consisted of 7 percentage points from WFS Enterprises, Incorporated, acquired on September 2nd, 2014, and a 4 percentage point increase from volume. The volume increase in Canada was led by growth to customers in the government and utilities end markets. Let’s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 12% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 13% in the 2014 fourth quarter versus the prior year. This performance consisted of 21 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by an 8 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States, partially offset by lower sales from Fabory in Europe. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let’s now take a look at December. There were 22 selling days in December of 2014 versus 21 in the same month of 2013. Total company sales increased 3% on a daily basis in December of 2014 versus December of 2013. The daily sales growth in December included 7 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola related safety products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 2 percentage point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. In the United States, December daily sales increased 4% driven by 8 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola related safety products, partially offset by a 3 percentage point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in fourth quarter 2013, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point negative variance from divestitures. December customer end market performance in the United States, excluding acquisitions, was as follows. Commercial was up in the low double-digits, Light Manufacturing was up in the high single digits, Heavy Manufacturing, Government and Natural Resources were up in the mid single digits, and Retail, Contractor and Reseller were down in the low single digits. Similar to the quarter, the strong performance in Commercial was driven by sales of Ebola's related safety products to healthcare customers. Daily sales in Canada for December increased 2% in U.S. dollars and were up 10% in local currency. The 10% daily sales increase consisted of 7 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and a 4 percentage point increase from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. The organic growth in Canada was driven by the Heavy and Light Manufacturing and Government end markets. Daily sales for the Other Businesses increased 7% in December, consisting of 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by an 11 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The volume growth was driven by Zoro in the United States, which grew more than 100% in the month, while sales from the businesses in Mexico and Japan grew double-digits in local currency. Let’s move on to January. Daily sales growth in the month of January is currently trending in the mid single digits. Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman: Thanks Laura. Since we've already reviewed company operating performance, we'll discuss performance by reporting segment. As a reminder, results in this discussion exclude the charges detailed in the earnings press release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. Operating earnings in the United States increased 11% versus the 2013 fourth quarter driven by the 6% sales growth and positive expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 10 basis points as a result of price increases exceeding cost increases, partially offset by faster growth with lower margin customers. Operating expenses increased 4% primarily due to productivity initiatives and lower than forecasted incremental investment spending of $1 million. The US operating margin increased a healthy 70 basis points to 17% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2013. Let’s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings declined 27% versus the 2013 fourth quarter, down 21% in local currency. This decrease was driven by lower gross profit margins. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 280 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to product cost inflation exceeding price inflation driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, higher freight costs and lower supplier rebates, as well as negative mix from the WFS acquisition. On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses were breakeven in the 2014 fourth quarter versus generating $3 million in earnings in the 2013 period. The decline in adjusted earnings was more than driven by incremental expenses associated with the start-up of the single channel online model business in Europe, partially offset by strong operating performance from Zoro in the United States. In addition, operating earnings growth from MonotaRO in Japan was strong in local currency but was essentially flat in US dollars. Other income and expense was a net expense of $5 million in the 2014 fourth quarter versus net expense of $2 million in the 2013 fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher foreign exchange transaction losses. The reported tax rate in 2014 was 42.3% for the quarter and 39.1% for the full year. Excluding the effect of items separately disclosed and other fourth quarter tax items, the tax rate was 38.2% for the quarter in the year 2014, compared to 37.3% in the 2013 quarter and year. The increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the United States versus geographies with lower tax rates and losses with no tax benefit. The company is currently projecting a tax rate of 37.7% to 38.8% for 2015. Lastly, let’s take a look at our cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $297 million, or 152% of adjusted net income, versus $246 million in 2013. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Gross capital expenditures for the quarter were $147 million versus $124 million in 2013. We paid dividends of $76 million in the quarter, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2014. In addition, we bought back 842,000 shares of stock for $208 million and ended the quarter with 8.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $284 million to shareholders in the quarter. As we noted earlier, we adjusted our 2015 guidance to reflect foreign exchange headwinds and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in Canada and now expect sales growth of 3% to 7% and earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.60. Let’s take a closer look at some of our assumptions for the full year and the first quarter. Keep in mind this reflects normalized results in 2014 as a basis for comparison. We’ll start with sales. For the full year, the change from our original guidance reflects lower organic growth in Canada and more headwinds from foreign exchange. The effect of foreign exchange reduces total company sales by 3%, compared to 1% in our November guidance. We originally expected 5% organic sales growth in Canada and now expect 2% growth in local currency, due to the weakening economy. Let’s move on to gross profit margins. We expect flattish gross profit margins for the full year 2015 versus the full year 2014. For the first quarter, we forecast gross profit margins to be down 20 to 60 basis points versus the 2014 first quarter. As a reminder, the company’s annual customer trade shows held in the first quarter typically result in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year, distorting sequential quarterly trends. Let’s take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we still expect 0 to 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by expansion in the United States and the Other Businesses, partially offset by margin contraction in Canada due to higher investment levels and challenging macroeconomic conditions. Finally, the effect of foreign currency translation, currency transaction and macroeconomic weakness is a reduction of $0.25 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. Please mark your calendar for the release of January sales on Thursday, February 12th. Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-16 00:00:00) =====
Laura Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations.  With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger’s 2014 third quarter results. 
 To supplement this podcast, please also reference our 2014 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website.
 Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.
 Today, we reported solid results for the 2014 third quarter, driven by the strong performance of our U.S. business. Over the next 20 minutes or so, Bill and I will provide you with some additional insight relative to the quarter. 
 Admittedly, there are many moving parts, so we thought it would make sense to start with the highlights from the quarter before we cover the details.
 Our U.S. business posted strong results, reflected by the 90 basis point improvement to operating margins, fueled by 6% volume growth and solid expense leverage.
 In Canada, sales are now growing, but margins are being pressured, as expected, due to unfavorable foreign exchange and increased investments in supply chain and IT.
 Earnings declined for our Other Businesses due to start-up costs for our single channel business in Europe and softer results from Fabory, tied to a weaker economy in Europe. 
 Our single channel businesses in Japan and the United States continue to perform well with strong top line growth. We delivered 12% earnings per share growth despite absorbing $0.09 in the quarter related to a higher tax rate.
 With that context, let's review the 2014 third quarter. Company sales increased 7%; operating earnings increased 11%; and net earnings increased 9%, reflecting the higher tax rate. Earnings per share were $3.30 for the quarter, an increase of 12% versus the 2013 third quarter.
 Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins decreased 80 basis points to 43% versus 43.8% in 2013, primarily driven by the acquired businesses, faster growth from lower gross margin customers and lower gross profit margins in most of the international businesses. Company operating margin increased 50 basis points to 15% versus 14.5% in the prior year.
 Operating expenses increased 2%, including $17 million in incremental growth in infrastructure-related spending versus the 2013 third quarter. The lighter spending in the quarter was primarily related to timing of projects in the distribution centers and IT. 
 In addition, we also invested in our single channel start-up in Europe, which has accelerated in recent months. 
 In the fourth quarter, growth spending is expected to accelerate, including investments in sales force expansion and a new CRM, existing distribution center upgrades, eCommerce and the new single channel model. We are currently forecasting approximately $32 million in incremental growth in infrastructure spending in the 2014 fourth quarter, which brings our full year forecast to $100 million. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail.
 Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2014 guidance and other key items.
 As I previously mentioned, total company sales for the quarter increased 7%. The 7% growth included 2 percentage points from acquisitions, net of dispositions, and a 1 percentage point reduction from unfavorable foreign exchange. Please see Exhibit 5 at the end of this podcast for more detail regarding acquisitions and divestitures. 
 Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 6%, driven by 6 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from price, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. 
 We realized 1 percentage point in price in the quarter and expect a rounded contribution of 1 percentage point for the year, given better pricing compliance in the United States and a small price increase in Canada to compensate for COGS inflation tied to products imported from the United States. 
 By month, daily sales increased 6% in July, 7% in August and 7% in September.
 Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses and also include results for the single channel businesses in Japan, the United States and Europe.
 Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenues in the quarter, increased 7%. This sales growth included 2 percentage points from acquisitions, net of dispositions. These acquisitions are performing well and are delivering synergies in excess of our original expectations. Please see Exhibit 5 for more detail on recent acquisitions. 
 Excluding acquisitions, organic sales increased 5%, driven by 6 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. 
 Daily sales increased 7% in July, 8% in August and 8% in September.
 Let's review U.S. sales performance by customer end market for the quarter. Natural Resources was up in the low double digits; Heavy Manufacturing was up in the high single digits; Commercial and Light Manufacturing were up in the mid-single digits; Retail and Government were up in the low single digits; Reseller was flat; and Contractor was down in the low single digits.
 Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter and increased 3%, 8% in local currency. 
 The 8% sales growth consisted of 5 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from price. Sales performance in Canada was led by solid growth to customers in the Commercial, Transportation, Government and Heavy and Light Manufacturing end markets. 
 By month, daily sales in local currency increased 1% in July, 6% in August and 15% in September, with the WFS Enterprises Inc. acquisition contributing 7 percentage points in the month. WFS expands our presence in Ontario and provides value through a broader product offering, additional solutions and technical expertise relevant to the manufacturing sector.
 Let's wrap up our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. The Other Businesses represented 11% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for this group were up 16% and consisted of 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily driven by the single channel businesses in Japan and in the United States and from the business in Mexico.
 Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September 2014 versus 20 days in the same month of 2013. Company sales increased 7% on a daily basis in September of 2014 versus September of 2013. The daily sales growth included 3 percentage points from acquisitions, net of dispositions, and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. September was the first month to include sales from WFS. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 5%, primarily driven by volume.
 In the United States, September daily sales increased 8%, which included 2 percentage points from acquisitions, net of dispositions. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales increased 6% on a daily basis, driven by volume. 
 Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States for the month of September. Natural Resources was up in the low double digits; Heavy Manufacturing was up in the high single digits; Commercial, Light Manufacturing and Retail were up in the mid-single digits; Government and Contractor were flat; and Reseller was down in the low single digits.
 Daily sales in Canada for September increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. The 15% increase consisted of 7 percentage points from volume, 7 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and 1 percentage point from price. 
 On an organic basis, all customer end markets contributed to the volume growth with the exception of Mining. Mining in Canada continues to be pressured by softness in the coal and potash sectors.
 Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 13% in September, consisting of 16 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 3 percentage points drag from unfavorable foreign exchange. 
 Similar to the quarter, daily sales growth in September was driven by the single channel businesses in Japan and in the United States and the business in Mexico.
 Sales growth in the month of October is currently trending in line with the organic sales growth of 5% reported for September. Keep in mind that we are up against a difficult comparison as we anniversary the date we began reporting sales for E&R Industrial. 
 As a reminder, our daily sales growth in October 2013 included 3 percentage points from acquisitions.
 Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman. 
William Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right in to performance by reportable segment. 
 Operating earnings in the United States increased 13% versus the 2013 third quarter. This performance was driven by the 7% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter decreased 80 basis points versus the prior year. About half of the decline was driven by share gain among large customers, which carry lower margins, with the remaining half coming from lower gross margins from the recently acquired businesses. Operating expenses were essentially flat versus prior year and included incremental growth and infrastructure-related spending of $12 million on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising. 
 The operating margin for the U.S. segment increased 90 basis points to 18.9% versus 18% in the prior year.
 Let's move on to our business in Canada. As expected, operating earnings were down versus the prior year, decreasing 14% in U.S. dollars. The lower operating performance was primarily the result of a lower gross profit margin and negative operating expense leverage. Gross profit margins declined 150 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States, lower supplier rebates and higher freight costs. The operating margin in Canada declined 180 basis points to 9.9% versus the prior year.
 The Other Businesses generated $5 million in operating earnings in the 2014 third quarter versus $6 million in the 2013 third quarter. The earnings decline versus prior year was primarily driven by incremental expenses associated with the start-up of the single channel business in Europe and continued soft performance by Fabory in Europe. This decline was partially offset by improved performance in Mexico and the single channel models of Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan, along with lower losses in China.
 Other income and expense of $3 million in the 2014 third quarter was flat versus the 2013 third quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 39.1% versus 38% in the 2013 quarter. The increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the U.S. segment with higher tax rates. 
 As a result of the higher-than-expected tax rate, the quarter included approximately $0.09 per share of higher tax expense, consisting of $0.03 per share related to the third quarter and $0.06 per share for the first half of 2014. We now project an effective tax rate for the year 2014 of approximately 38.3%, excluding the effect of the $0.15 per share charge related to the Fabory retirement plan transition in the second quarter of 2014. 
 The higher tax rate is expected to result in a $0.03 per share reduction in the fourth quarter, totaling $0.12 per share reduction for the full year 2014.
 Let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $329 million versus $354 million in 2013. Cash flow in the 2014 third quarter was lower, primarily due to higher inventory purchases and higher accounts receivable. The company used the cash generated to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. 
 Capital expenditures for the quarter were $84 million versus $65 million in 2013. We paid dividends of $74 million, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2014. 
 In addition, we bought back 336,000 shares of stock for $82 million and ended the quarter with 9.4 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
 In total, we returned $156 million to shareholders in the quarter.
 As reported in our 2014 third quarter earnings release, we lowered the top end of our sales and earnings guidance for the year 2014. With 9 months under our belt, we have better visibility and are able to narrow our ranges and reflect the higher effective tax rate for the year. We now expect 2014 earnings per share of $12.20 to $12.30, excluding the $0.15 per share charge for the Fabory retirement plan transition. 
 With that as a backdrop, let's take a look at our current expectations. All comparisons are to prior year unless otherwise noted.
 We'll begin with sales. For the full year, we now expect sales growth of 5% to 5.5%. We've also revised our full year price inflation estimate to 0.5%, given better pricing compliance in the United States and a small price increase in Canada to compensate for COGS inflation tied to products imported from the United States.
 For the fourth quarter, the new guidance implies roughly 4% to 5.5% reported daily sales growth. It is very important to note that the 2013 fourth quarter included a bit more than 4 months of sales for E&R Industrial, which we acquired on August 23, 2013. 
 Adjusting for E&R and the other relevant acquisition and divestiture activity, we expect organic daily sales growth of 6% to 7% in the quarter.
 Let's move on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin contraction of about 20 basis points on a reported basis and expansion of about 10 basis points on an organic basis. 
 For the fourth quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to increase 90 basis points on a reported basis. The increase is primarily due to easy comparisons to the previous year, driven by the acquired and international businesses.
 Let's take a look at operating margins. For the full year, we expect operating margin expansion of 10 to 20 basis points on a reported basis. This includes $100 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending for the year as detailed on Exhibit 3.
 For the fourth quarter, we are expecting operating margin expansion of about 80 to 100 basis points on a reported basis. This includes approximately $32 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending. 
 We also anticipate additional spending for productivity work, which is expected to drive better expense leverage in the future.
 Finally, the tax rate. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 38.3% for the full year and for the 2014 fourth quarter. Again, this excludes the effect of the Fabory pension transition reported in the 2014 second quarter. 
 The higher tax rate is expected to represent a $0.12 per share headwind for the full year, including $0.03 per share in the 2014 fourth quarter.
 Please mark your calendar for the following important dates: on Wednesday, November 12, we plan to release October sales, and we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting at our headquarters in Lake Forest; on Thursday, November 13, we will host a tour of our national distribution center in Minooka, Illinois.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-17 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown - Senior Vice President, Communications & Investor Relations Bill Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations
Analysts:
Laura Brown: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2014 second quarter results. Please also reference our 2014 second quarter earnings release issued on July 17th in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Today we reported results for the 2014 second quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for 2014. While there are several moving parts this quarter, we continue to be pleased with the US segment, which represents 78% of sales and the majority of company earnings. In addition, our three most recent US acquisitions are exceeding our sales and earnings expectations. Furthermore, the investments, we continue to make in growth and infrastructure are helping us gain share with our large more complex customers who appreciate our value proposition. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to highlight a non-cash charge included in the second quarter. Fabory, our business in Europe, recorded a $10 million after-tax or $0.15 per share charge related to the replacement of its existing defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan. As part of the transition, Fabory transferred the plan assets and its existing and future obligations under the defined benefit plan to a third party. The recognition of actuarial losses combined with the write-off of the related asset and liability resulted in this charge. The change will create better alignment with market trends in The Netherlands and help reduce future benefits cost to the company. Excluding this non-cash charge from the 2014 second quarter, company operating earnings increased 1%, while net earnings declined 1%. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.09 for the quarter, a 2% increase versus $3.03 in 2013. Now let's look at our reported results for the 2014 second quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 5% versus the 2013 second quarter. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Reported operating earnings decreased 3% and net earnings decreased 5%. Reported earnings per share were $2.94 for the quarter, a decline of 3% versus the 2013 second quarter. We also lowered the top end of our 2014 guidance range for sales and narrowed our expectations for earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of this podcast. Our 2014 guidance issued on January 24, 2014, called for sales growth of 5% to 9% and earnings per share of $12.10 to $12.85. We now expect 2014 sales growth of 5% to 7% and earnings per share of $12.20 to $12.60. Please note the earnings per share guidance excludes the $0.15 per share charge in the 2014 second quarter. Despite the lower sales outlook for the year, we expect 10 basis points to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion for the year. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 90 basis points to 43.1% versus 44.0% in 2013, due primarily to unfavorable mix from the acquired businesses, faster growth with lower gross margin customers in the United States and lower gross profit margins from the international businesses. Operating expenses for the company increased 6%, driven by the following: $20 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending, $14 million related to the Fabory retirement plan transition cost noted earlier, incremental expenses from the acquired businesses, and $7 million related to a write-off of capitalized software development cost primarily for Canada and Mexico. In the second quarter, gross spending was lower than previously estimated, primarily due to timing of supply chain investments. In the first quarter of 2014, we had forecasted $115 million in incremental growth-related investments for the year. We continue to invest in our growth drivers, but now estimate incremental growth-related spending of $90 million to $110 million for 2014. We view our commitment to investing in growth as an example of our leadership in the MRO industry that will help us gain market share over the long term. Given that we are at the midyear point, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our growth drivers. E-commerce, our e-commerce sales continue to grow at twice the rate of our other channels. For the first half of 2014, e-commerce represented 35% of total company sales, up 200 basis points from full year 2013. Inventory management, we added more than 7,400 KeepStock installations in United States in the first half of the year and are targeting 12,000 installations for the full year. Outside of United States, primarily in Canada, we added more than 1,200 KeepStock installations in the first six months of the year. Sales to customers with inventory management grow at twice the rate of sales to customers without this service. Distribution network, we enhanced our North American distribution center network to accommodate growth and increased scale. We continue construction of a 500,000 square foot distribution center in the Toronto area expected to be operational by early 2015. We also purchased land to build a 1.3 million square foot facility in New Jersey, which is scheduled to open in 2016. The new distribution center will add needed supply chain capacity to our highest volume region in United States. Single-channel online model, sales from MonotaRO, our online business in Japan, grew more than 30% in local currency. Revenue for Zoro grew more than 120%. Sales force expansion, we added approximately 70 new sales representatives in United States in the first half of the year and expect to hire more by yearend. M&A, the three recently acquired businesses in the United States, Techni-Tool, E&R and Safety Solutions, are outperforming our sales and earnings projections and remain on track with our integration plans. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we'll wrap with a discussion of our 2014 guidance and other key items. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 5%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 5% in April, 6% in May and 4% in June. Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from acquisitions net of dispositions and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4%, driven by 5 percentage points from volume, partially offset by 1 percentage point from the timing of Good Friday. Good Friday fell in April 2014 versus March 2013. Good Friday is typically a day of slower customer activity in United States, with operations closed in Canada and much of Latin America. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%. Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from acquisitions net of dispositions. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales increased 5%, driven by 6 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from the timing of Good Friday. Let's review sales performance by customer end-market in United States. Heavy and light manufacturing, retail, commercial and natural resources were up in the mid-single digits. Government and reseller were up in the low-single digits. And contractor was down in the low-single digits. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 10% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales decreased 9% in US dollars versus the prior year and were down 3% in local currency. The 3% sales decline consisted of 2 percentage points from the timing of Good Friday and a 1 percentage point decline from volume. Declines during the quarter in the construction, mining, oil and gas, government, light manufacturing and reseller customer end-markets more than offset growth to customers in the commercial, forestry, utilities, transportation, heavy manufacturing and retail end-markets. Canada sales results continue to be affected by macroeconomic weakness and softness in natural resources. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 12% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 14% for the 2014 second quarter versus the prior year. The sales growth consisted of 15 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 2 percentage points decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to growth from Zoro and the business in Japan, which more than offset a modest sales decline in Europe. Early in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 21 selling days in June of 2014 versus 20 days in the same month of 2013. Daily company sales increased 4% in June of 2014 versus June of '13. The daily sales increase included 2 percentage points from acquisitions net of dispositions and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic daily sales increased 3%, driven by 4 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. In the United States, June daily sales increased 6%, driven by 5 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from acquisitions net of dispositions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. June customer end-market performance in the United States was as follows. Heavy and light manufacturing and natural resources were up in the mid-single digits. Retail and commercial were up in the low-single digits. Reseller and government were flat. And contractor was down in the low-single digits. Daily sales in Canada for June decreased 7% in US dollars and were down 2% in local currency. The 2% decline consisted of a 2 percentage points decline from sales related to floods in Calgary in 2013, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the Canada Day holiday. Canada Day fell on Tuesday July 1st this year. Many businesses were either closed or had much lower activity on Monday June 30th. In 2013, the holiday fell on Monday July 1st with little or no effect on June sales. The sales decrease was partially offset by a 1 percentage point increase from volume and 1 percentage point increase from price. Excluding the headwind noted above, daily sales increased 2% in local currency. The 2% daily sales decrease in local currency in Canada was related to declines in the construction, mining, government, light manufacturing and retail customer end-markets, more than offsetting growth to customers in the commercial, heavy manufacturing, forestry, utilities, transportation and oil and gas end-markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 9% in June consisting entirely of volume and price. The daily sales increase primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro and the businesses in Japan and Mexico. Daily sales growth during June in Japan dropped to low-double digits due to one less selling day in the month. Sales growth in the month of July is currently trending ahead of the growth rate reported for June, including a benefit from the favorable timing of the July 4th holiday. In addition, daily sales to date in Canada are growing in the low-single digits in local currency. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's talk about performance by reportable segment. In the United States, gross profit margins for the quarter declined 80 basis points due to mix from the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower gross margin customers. Operating expenses increased 3%, including $19 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising. Operating earnings for the US segment increased 8% in the quarter, driven by the 7% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins. Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings in Canada declined 48% in the 2014 second quarter and were down 45% in local currency. The earnings decline was primarily driven by lower sales, a lower gross profit margin and negative operating expense leverage. The gross profit margin in Canada declined about 200 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States, inventory markdowns and higher freight costs. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the IT write-down and non-reoccurring expenses. The company made the decision to move ahead with a single ERP instance versus multiple instances in North America. As a result, $4 million of capitalized software development costs related to a multiple instance approach were written off and an incremental $1 million was spent on the implementation of the single instance in Canada. Operating earnings for the Other Businesses were roughly breakeven in the 2014 second quarter versus $13 million in the 2013 second quarter. Lower performance versus the prior year was primarily driven by the $14 million cost incurred for the retirement plan transition in Europe and the write-off of approximately $2 million of capitalized software development in Mexico. Excluding these two items, the Other Businesses generated $15 million in operating earnings. Increased earnings from Zoro in Japan were tempered by the businesses in China and Latin America. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $2.3 million expense in the 2014 second quarter versus a net $2.6 million expense in the 2013 second quarter. The tax rate of the quarter was 38.2% versus 36.5% in the 2013 quarter. The 2014 second quarter reflects a higher tax rate due to the effect of the retirement plan transition in Europe. Excluding the retirement plan transition, the effective tax rate for the 2014 second quarter was 37.7%. The 2013 second quarter tax rate reflected a benefit from a resolution of foreign tax matters in that period. Excluding that benefit, the effective tax rate for the 2013 second quarter was 37.3%. The company projects an effective tax rate for the year 2014 of approximately 37.5% to 37.8% excluding the effect of the retirement plan transition. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $161 million versus $210 million in 2013. Cash generation from operations and cash on hand was lower in the 2014 quarter due to higher inventory purchases and higher tax payments versus the prior year. The company yields the cash to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $90 million, which included the purchase of land for a new distribution center in New Jersey, versus $40 million in 2013. We paid dividends of $76 million, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2014. In addition, we bought back 334,000 shares of stock for $85 million and ended the quarter with 9.9 million shares remaining under share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $161 million to shareholders in the quarter. As reported in our 2014 second quarter earnings release, we lowered the top end of our 2014 sales guidance and narrowed earnings per share guidance. We now expect 5% to 7% sales growth and earnings per share of $12.20 to $12.60. Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. The new guidance range implies roughly 5% to 9% daily sales growth for the remainder of the year. This outlook anticipates easier comparisons versus the prior year. Let's now discuss gross profit margins. For the full year on an organic basis, we expect gross margins to expand as much as 10 basis points. On a reported basis, we are forecasting gross margins to be down 20 basis points versus 2013, primarily due to lower gross margins from the mix of acquired businesses. Let's take a closer look at company operating margin expectations. For the full year on an organic basis, we expect 15 basis points to 35 basis points of operating margin expansion. On a reported basis, we are forecasting fully year operating margin expansion of 10 basis points to 30 basis points. Looking ahead to the back half of the year, while we acquired the E&R business in August of 2013, we didn't begin consolidating the results until the fourth quarter. And as we discussed earlier, we anticipate overall growth in infrastructure spending at a slower rate primarily based on the timing of projects and a weaker economic outlook. And lastly, we'd like to leave you with one modeling tip. Please be sure to review the bottom of the income statement for the calculation of net earnings available to common shareholders. Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On August 6th at 19:15 Eastern Time, Laura Brown, Senior Vice President, Communications & Investor Relations, will present at the CFA Society of Minnesota Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The presentation will be webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website. On August 13th, we plan to release July sales. On September 16th at 12:45 Eastern Time, we will present at the Second Annual Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference at Dana Point, California. The presentation will also be webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website. On October 16th, we're scheduled to report third quarter results. And finally, we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on November 12th, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-04-16 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown - Senior Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations Bill Chapman - Senior Director, Investor Relations
Laura Brown - Senior Vice President, Communications & Investor Relations: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger’s first quarter 2014 results. Please reference our 2014 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast.   Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Today, we reported record results for the 2014 first quarter and reiterated our sales and earnings per share guidance for 2014. In a quarter that experienced weather-related disruptions in North America and macroeconomic weakness outside of the United States, we delivered solid earnings and margins that were in line with the expectations we provided in the fourth quarter of 2013. At the end of this recording, we will talk in more detail about our guidance and assumptions. Let’s begin with an overview. Company sales for the quarter increased 5%. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. Operating earnings increased 3% and net earnings increased 2%. Earnings per share were $3.07 for the quarter, an increase of 4% versus the previous year. Let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Reported gross profit margins decreased 10 basis points to 45.1% versus 45.2% in 2013 primarily due to the newly acquired businesses. Please reference Exhibit 5. Company operating earnings increased 3% versus the 2013 quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the 5% sales growth partially offset by lower gross profit margins. Operating expenses also increased 5% driven by $31 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending as well as incremental expenses from the acquired businesses. Our reported company operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 14.9% versus 15.1% in 2013 primarily due to decline in gross margins. On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, company gross profit margins for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 45.5% versus 45.3% in 2013. The company operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 15.0% versus 15.2% in 2013, primarily due to lower performance in Canada. We took a cautious approach to growth and infrastructure spending in the 2014 first quarter given softer than expected sales growth in the first two months of the quarter. Given the pacing of projects and lower than expected spending in the first quarter, we are now anticipating full year incremental growth spending of approximately $115 million. We view our commitment to invest in growth as an example of our leadership in the MRO industry and the ability to continue gaining market share over the long-term. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we will cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and in the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2014 guidance and other key items. Before we begin our discussion of sales, please note that although some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales. Company sales for the quarter increased 5%. By month, increases were as follows: 3% in January, 3% in February, and 8% in March. Sales growth in March benefited from the timing of Good Friday that fell in March last year and will occur in April this year. The 5% sales growth in the first quarter included 2 percentage points from acquisitions net of dispositions and 2 percentage points reduction from foreign exchange. On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales increased 5% driven by 4 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from higher sales of seasonal products partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline due to the extreme weather that closed some customer and Grainger facilities in North America during the months of January and February. The extreme weather resulted in lost sales volume that is not likely to be recovered. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, primarily located in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%. Sales results in the first quarter included 2 percentage points from acquisitions, net of dispositions. On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions, sales increased 5% driven by 4 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from higher sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline due to the extreme weather in January and February. By month, sales increased 6% in January, 5% in February and 10% in March. Let’s review sales performance by customer end-market for the quarter in the United States: heavy manufacturing and natural resources were up in the high single-digits; light manufacturing, commercial and retail were up in the mid single-digits; government and reseller were up in the low single-digits; and contractor was down in the low single-digits.  Now, let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a sluggish macroeconomic environment and unfavorable currency exchange. Sales in the 2014 first quarter decreased 10% and were down 2% in local currency. The 2% sales decline consisted of a 4 percentage points decline from volume, partially offset by 2 percentage points benefit from the timing of Good Friday. The weakness in the Canadian economy is being driven by lower commodity prices and a reduction of Canadian exports. By month, sales in Canadian dollars decreased 4% in January, 2% in February and increased 1% in March. The 2% sales decrease for the quarter in Canada was driven by declines in the construction, light and heavy manufacturing, mining, retail, government, and oil and gas customer end-markets partially offset by growth from utilities, forestry, transportation and reseller customer end-markets. For reference, approximately two-thirds of revenue is generated in the Western provinces with a higher concentration in natural resources. Let’s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America and represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 11%, which consisted of 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 7 percentage points decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to solid revenue growth from Zoro Tools and the businesses in Mexico and Japan. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let’s now take a look at March. There were 21 selling days in March of 2014, the same as in 2013. Company sales increased 8% versus March of 2013. Sales results in March included 2 percentage points from acquisitions, net of dispositions and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales increased 7% driven by 6 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point benefit from the timing of Good Friday. Sales were softer in the first half of the month and accelerated as weather conditions improved in North America. In the United States, March sales increased 10%. This increase was due to 7 percentage points increase in volume, 2 percentage points from the E&R and Safety Solutions acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 1 percentage point from the timing of Good Friday. March customer end-market performance in the United States was as follows: heavy manufacturing, natural resources and retail were up in the low double-digits; light manufacturing and commercial were up in the high single-digits; government was up in the mid single-digits; reseller was up in the low single-digits; and contractor was down in the low single-digits. Sales in Canada for March were down 7%, but were up 1% in local currency. The 1% sales increase consisted of 5 percentage points benefit from the timing of Good Friday partially offset by 4 percentage points decline in volume. The volume decline was driven by lower sales to the construction, light manufacturing, mining, retail, government and reseller customer end-markets partially offset by growth to customers in the utilities, forestry, heavy manufacturing, and oil and gas customer end-markets. Sales for our Other Businesses increased 16% in March, consisting of 19 percentage points from volume and price, 1 percentage point benefit from the timing of Good Friday, partially offset by 4 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by Zoro Tools and the businesses in Mexico and Japan. In local currency, sales for the business in Japan grew more than 30%, but were partially offset by a weaker Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Looking ahead to April, daily sales growth to date in April is running in line with the sales growth we reported for March. Keep in mind however that we will face some headwinds from the Easter holiday in the back half of the month. Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman - Senior Director, Investor Relations: Thanks, Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let’s jump right into results by reportable segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 7% versus the 2013 first quarter, while operating margins were flat at 18.7%. Gross profit margins for the quarter decreased 30 basis points driven by lower gross margins from the newly acquired businesses and faster growth with lower margin customers. Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales, which included incremental expenses from the acquired businesses and $26 million in incremental growth and infrastructure-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising.   For the U.S. business on an organic basis, excluding acquisitions, gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 46.9% versus 46.5% in 2013 driven by price inflation exceeding cost inflation. Operating margin increased 30 basis points to 19.2% versus 18.9% in 2013 reflecting higher gross margins, partially offset by negative expense leverage. Let’s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 35% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by the 10% sales decline, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage. Gross margins in Canada decreased 20 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to higher freight costs, along with the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Also contributing to the lower operating performance was increased payroll, benefits and severance, and approximately $2 million in incremental spending related to IT system investments. We continue to invest in the business in Canada through this tougher macroeconomic environment to strengthen our operations and better position the business for the long-term. The Other Businesses generated $8 million in operating earnings in the 2014 and 2013 first quarters. This performance included strong results from Zoro Tools partially offset by lower performance from the businesses in Latin America and costs to evaluate the new online business in other markets. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net expense of $2.7 million in the 2014 first quarter versus $1.4 million in the 2013 first quarter. For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2014 was 37.7% versus 37.3% in 2013. The increase was primarily due to more earnings in the United States relative to other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We are still projecting an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.8% for the full year 2014. Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $168 million versus $176 million in 2013. The lower cash flow was driven primarily by lower trade accounts payable balances related to the timing of inventory purchases. We used the cash flow and cash flow on hand to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million versus $43 million in 2013. We paid dividends of $65 million, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2013. In addition, we bought back 615,000 shares of stock for $150 million and ended the quarter with 3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $215 million to shareholders in the quarter. As reported in our 2014 first quarter earnings release, we reiterated our 2014 sales and earnings per share guidance. The sales guidance range remains at 5% to 9% growth. It’s important to note that we slightly revised the composition. The low end reflects more volume contribution and less price realization. Let’s look more closely at the underlying elements of our expectations. Let’s start with gross profit margins. For the full year, on an organic basis, we continue to expect gross margin expansion to reach 30 basis points at the high-end driven primarily by the United States. On a reported basis, we are forecasting minimal gross margin expansion versus 2013 due to lower gross margins from the acquired businesses. For the 2014 second quarter, we expect organic gross profit margins to be down approximately 15 basis points due primarily to one-time inventory transition costs in Canada in preparation for the relocation to the new distribution center in Toronto. On a reported basis, we are expecting gross profit margins to decrease by about 60 basis points due to the acquired businesses. Please keep in mind that as you model margins for the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our first quarter included supplier support provided for our annual customer tradeshows. As a result, both gross profit and operating expenses as a percent of sales are inflated by about 100 basis points. Let’s take a closer look at company operating margin expectations. In 2014, we anticipate operating margin contraction in the first half followed by operating margin expansion in the second half. This is due to the carryover effect of the 2013 second half growth and infrastructure spending and the acquisition of the lower margin businesses. For the full year, on an organic basis, we continue to expect 15 to 45 basis points of operating margin expansion. On a reported basis, we are forecasting full year operating margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, reflecting negative mix from the acquisitions. For the 2014 second quarter, on an organic basis, operating margins are forecasted to decline 40 to 80 basis points due to the incremental growth and infrastructure spending anticipated in the second quarter. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information. For the 2014 second quarter, on a reported basis, operating margins could decline 50 to 100 basis points. Please mark your calendar for the following upcoming events. On April 30, we will host our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The script from the presentation will be available on our website following the event. On May 6, DG Macpherson, Senior Vice President and Group President, Global Supply Chain and International, will present at the Robert W. Baird Growth Stock Conference in Chicago. The event will be webcast. And finally, we will release April sales on Tuesday, May 13. Overall, we are pleased with our start to 2014. We continue to invest in the business to gain share and deliver solid returns to shareholders. And we appreciate your support and thank you for your interest in Grainger. If you have any questions, please contact Laura Brown at 847-535-0409, Casey Darby at 847-535-0099 or me at 847-535-0881. Thank you.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-01-24 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations
Laura D. Brown: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's fourth quarter 2013 results. Please also reference our 2013 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 24, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Today, we reported results for the year 2013 and updated our earnings per share and sales guidance for 2014. For the full year 2013, company sales increased 5% to $9.4 billion. Net earnings increased 16% to $797 million and earnings per share increased 17% to $11.13. Operating cash flow increased 21% to $986 million. Despite a challenging economic environment, this was a solid year for Grainger as we continued to invest in infrastructure and growth designed to accelerate our share gains within the MRO market and increase our size and scale. We also updated our guidance. We now expect 2014 earnings per share of $12.10 to $12.85 and sales of 5% to 9% growth. This change is largely due to a weaker Canadian dollar in recent months and the divestiture of a number of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands that were sold on December 31, 2013. Our 2014 guidance issued on November 13, 2013, called for earnings per share of $12.25 to $13 and sales of 6% to 10% growth. To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of the podcast excludes the effects of the charges in 2013 and 2012. Details regarding the charges can be found in the 2013 fourth quarter earnings press release and Exhibit 1 of this podcast posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. Excluding the charges from the years 2013 and 2012, company operating earnings increased 8%, while net earnings increased 9%. Earnings per share were $11.52 for the year, representing a 10% increase versus $10.43 in 2012. Unfavorable foreign exchange was a significant headwind throughout the year, reflecting a $0.08 per share reduction to earnings per share. Now let's turn to the 2013 fourth quarter. Results were within the expectations issued at our Analyst Day in November. Guidance for the 2013 fourth quarter included 6% to 8% sales growth and earnings per share of $2.53 to $2.73. Company sales in the fourth quarter increased 7%. Excluding the charges from 2013 and 2012, operating earnings increased 3%, while net earnings increased 6%. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.59 for the quarter, representing an increase of 7% versus the 2012 fourth quarter. Unfavorable foreign exchange was a headwind, while the acquired businesses with lower gross margins and acquisition-related costs negatively affected operating margins. E&R Industrial, E&R, was slightly accretive to earnings in the quarter, performing ahead of our original expectations. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins were 42.3% versus 43.6% in the 2012 fourth quarter. The 130 basis points decrease was driven by lower gross margins from the acquired businesses, which accounted for approximately 2/3 of the decrease. The remainder of the decline related to faster growth with lower-margin customers. In our Third Quarter Podcast, we forecasted that gross profit margins would decline as much as 40 basis points. The actual decline was larger than expected due to E&R's strong sales performance and the addition of the Safety Solutions acquisition in December. In addition, higher-than-expected freight costs, lower-than-expected supplier rebates contributed to the decline. On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter increased 3%. The earnings growth was driven by the 7% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses grew 4%, including $31 million in incremental growth-related spending. Incremental growth spending for the full year 2013 was $132 million versus 2012. Operating expenses benefited from $22 million in gains from the sale of fixed assets and the divestiture of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands in the fourth quarter. The majority of the gains were offset by severance and other related costs. A schedule summarizing incremental growth spending for 2010 through 2013 can be found in Exhibit 4 of this podcast posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. Company operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.3% versus 12.7% a year ago. In our Third Quarter Podcast, we shared that operating margins in the fourth quarter could decline as much as 20 basis points. The actual decline exceeded our estimate, primarily due to strong performance from E&R, the Safety Solutions acquisition and unfavorable foreign exchange, which was more of a factor than we anticipated. Excluding the acquisitions, the company operating margin for the fourth quarter would have been flat versus 2012. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2014 guidance and other key items. Now let's discuss 2013 fourth quarter, December and January sales, in more detail. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 7%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 7% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 5 percentage points from volume, 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage points decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from Hurricane Sandy-related sales in 2012. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 7% in October, 5% in November and 9% in December. December included 2 months of sales from E&R. Sales for this new acquisition had been reported on a 1-month lag and caught up in December. As a result, the sales contributions from acquisitions, which also includes Techni-Tool and Safety Solutions, was higher in the month. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 10%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 10% in October, 7% in November and 12% in December. The 10% sales growth was driven by 5 percentage points from volume, 6 percentage points from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price and 1 percentage point from an unfavorable comparison to sales related to Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Here is the sales performance, excluding acquisitions, for each respective customer end market in the quarter. Light manufacturing was up in the low double digits. Heavy manufacturing and retail were up in the high single digits. Commercial and natural resources were up in the mid-single digits. Government was flat, and contractor and reseller were down in the low single digits. Within government, sales to state and local customers, which accounted for approximately 75% of our government sales, grew in the mid-single digits, while sales to federal customers were down in the mid-teens for the quarter. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada decreased 3% in U.S. dollars and increased 3% in local currency. Sales consisted of 3 percentage points from volume, offset by 6 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 1% in October, 3% in November and 6% in December. Sales performance in Canada was driven by growth in the commercial, transportation, light manufacturing and forestry end markets. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 3%, which consisted of 11 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by an 8 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by Zoro Tools and the business in Mexico. The business in Japan grew more than 20% in local currency, but the growth was offset by the weakness in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at December. There were 21 selling days in December of 2013 versus 20 in the same month of 2012. Total company sales increased 9% on a daily basis in December of 2013 versus December of 2012. The daily sales growth in December included 6 percentage points from acquisitions, 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from price. As I mentioned earlier, E&R contributed 2 months of sales in December, so the sales contribution from acquisitions was higher in the month versus the rest of the quarter. In the United States, December daily sales increased 12%, driven by 7 percentage points from acquisitions, 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 1 percentage point from price. December customer end-market performance in the United States, excluding acquisitions, was as follows. Light manufacturing, retail and natural resources were up in the low double digits. Heavy manufacturing, commercial and contractor were up in the mid-single digits. Reseller was up in the low single digits, and government was flat. Similar to the quarter, sales to state and local government customers grew in the low single digits, while sales to federal customers were down in the low double digits for the month. Daily sales in Canada for December decreased 2% in U.S. dollars but were up 6% in local currency. The 2% daily sales decline consisted of 5 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, offset by 8 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the commercial, transportation, retail, utilities and forestry end markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 4% in December, consisting of 13 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a negative 9 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Strong sales growth of nearly 20% in Japan was offset by the weakness in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Let's move on to January. The story thus far has been weather and foreign exchange. In the United States, sales, including acquisitions, were flat the first 5 business days of the month due to the extreme cold and snow across much of the country. During the next 10 business days, sales rebounded to the mid to upper single digits. As the month progresses, cold weather and snow in the United States and Canada continued to be an issue. Outside of the United States, foreign exchange in Canada and Japan continued to be a significant headwind. Combined with the softness in Europe, we expect total company daily sales growth in the low single digits for the month of January. As a reminder, January sales will exclude the direct-marketing Specialty Brands divested at the end of December. These businesses contributed approximately $96 million in revenue in 2013. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, we will discuss performance by reporting segment. As a reminder, results in this discussion exclude the charges detailed in the earnings press release and Exhibit 1 of this podcast, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. Adjusted operating earnings in the United States increased 7% versus the 2012 fourth quarter, driven by the 10% sales growth and positive expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter decreased 180 basis points, driven by lower gross margins from the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower-margin customers. Of the 180 basis point decline, nearly 2/3 is related to acquisitions with lower gross margins. Positive expense leverage was driven by the 10% sales growth versus a 5% increase in operating expenses and included $28 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and inventory management. The U.S. operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 16.3%, primarily due to the acquired businesses with lower gross profit margins. Excluding the acquisitions, the adjusted operating margin for the U.S. segment would have increased 20 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year. Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 10% versus the 2012 fourth quarter, down 5% in local currency. The decrease was driven by lower gross profit margins, the 3% sales decline due to unfavorable foreign exchange and negative expense leverage. Gross margins in Canada decreased 20 basis points versus the prior year. This decline was primarily due to product cost inflation exceeding price inflation, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, which is a function of purchasing approximately 1/3 of Canada's products from the United States. Contributing to the lower operating performance was approximately $2 million in incremental spending related to IT systems enhancements. On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses generated $3 million in operating earnings in both the 2013 and 2012 quarters. Strong operating performance for Zoro Tools offset lower performance from most of the Other Businesses. In addition, the business in Japan generated strong earnings growth in local currency, which was more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. We are currently evaluating the operating performance and strategic direction of some of the international businesses that are not meeting expectations. Other income and expense was a net expense of $2 million in the 2013 fourth quarter versus a net expense of $5 million in the 2012 fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates in the 2013 fourth quarter versus the 2012 fourth quarter. For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2013 was 37.3% versus 37.6% in 2012. For the year, the effective tax rate was 37.3% versus 37.5% in 2012. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.8% for the year 2014. The higher expected tax rate in 2014 is primarily a function of higher earnings in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Lastly, let's took -- take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $246 million versus $240 million in 2012. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business, fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $124 million versus $95 million in 2012. We paid dividends of $67 million in the quarter, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2013. In addition, we bought back 606,000 shares of stock for $159 million and ended the quarter with 3.6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $226 million to shareholders in the quarter. At our analyst meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2014. As reported in our 2013 fourth quarter earnings release, we adjusted our guidance and we now expect 2014 earnings per share of $12.10 to $12.85 and sales of 5% to 9% growth. This change is primarily related to increased unfavorable foreign exchange and the divestiture of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands. Now let's take a closer look of some of the assumptions for the full year 2014 and the 2014 first quarter. We'll start with sales. For the full year, the change from our original sales guidance relates primarily to an increase in unfavorable foreign exchange, largely in Canada, and to a lesser extent, Japan; and the divestiture of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands, reducing total company sales by 1%. Also, January will be the first month to reflect the annual price increase in the U.S. business. We expect 1% price inflation for full year 2014. Let's move on to gross profit margins. For the full year, on an organic basis, gross margin expansion could reach 30 basis points at the high end, driven by the United States and Canada. On a reported basis, we are forecasting minimal gross margin expansion versus 2013 due to lower gross margins from the acquired businesses. For the first quarter, we expect organic gross profit margins to be up approximately 20 basis points. On a reported basis, we are expecting gross profit margins to decrease by about 30 basis points due to the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower-margin customers. Lastly, the company's annual customer trade show held in the first quarter typically results in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year. Now let's take a closer look at company operating margin expectations. For the full year, on an organic basis, we continue to expect 15 to 45 basis points of expansion. On a reported basis, we are forecasting full year operating margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, which is a change from the November guidance of 0 to 30 basis points. This change is tied to the divestiture of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands in December and lower sales from Canada due to larger headwinds from foreign exchange. For the 2014 first quarter, on a reported basis, we are forecasting that operating margins could decline 50 to 100 basis points from the carryover effect of growth and infrastructure spending and the acquisition of lower-margin businesses which occurred in the second half 2013. This will create an unfavorable comparison during the first half of 2014. Now on an organic basis, operating margins are forecasted to decline as much as 40 basis points in the quarter. Please see Exhibit 4 for a schedule of growth spending in this podcast posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. In 2014, we anticipate unfavorable operating margin expansion in the first half, followed by stronger operating margin expansion in the second half. Lastly, we are forecasting foreign exchange to represent a $0.15 per share drag for the full year 2014 versus our November guidance. Please mark your calendar for the release of January sales on Thursday, February 13. Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-10-16 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations
Laura D. Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2013 third quarter results. Please also reference our 2013 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. For purposes of this podcast, we are excluding the $76 million in reserves, or $0.66 per share, we announced in last year's quarter related to litigation with the General Services Administration and United States Postal Service. Today, we narrowed our guidance for the full year and now expect sales growth of 5% to 6%, and earnings per share of $11.45 to $11.65. While we expect to achieve record results for the year 2013 with 10% to 12% EPS growth, this year has been a tale of 2 halves. In the first half of the year, we experienced solid operating margin expansion, increased gross margins and strong earnings leverage. As our growth initiatives and IT projects spending have accelerated and our gross margin expansion has eased, the second half of 2013 is resulting in more modest operating leverage. For the 2013 third quarter, we were pleased with the volume growth in our U.S. business, given the challenging economic environment. Earnings growth in the United States was in line with our expectations. However, our businesses outside of the United States remain affected by weaker macroeconomic conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and performed below our expectations. With that as a backdrop, let's review the 2013 third quarter. Company sales increased 5%, 4% on a daily basis. There were 64 selling days in the quarter, 1 more than in 2012. Operating earnings increased 5% and net earnings increased 4%. Earnings per share were $2.95 for the quarter, an increase of 5% versus the 2012 third quarter. We also narrowed our guidance ranges for both 2013 sales and earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of the podcast. Let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins increased 20 basis points to 43.8% versus 43.6% in 2012, primarily driven by Canada and the Other Businesses. Company operating margin was flat, with the prior year at 14.5%. Operating expenses increased 6%, including $40 million in incremental growth-related spending versus the 2012 third quarter. These growth investments include additional sales coverage, eCommerce, inventory management, advertising, IT systems and expansion in the company's distribution center network. We are currently forecasting approximately $36 million in growth spending in the 2013 fourth quarter, which brings our full year forecast to $135 million. In the quarter, we added approximately 100 new sales representatives in the United States, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly 200. eCommerce sales continued to grow faster than the rest of the business, and currently represents 33% of total company sales. We also added more than 4,000 KeepStock installations in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to more than 11,000 installations in the United States. These KeepStock installations include Vendor Managed Inventory, Customer Managed Inventory, and Vending solutions. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2013 guidance and other key items. As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter increased 5%, 4% on a daily basis. The 4% increase in daily sales in the quarter consisted of 4 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange. By month, daily sales increased 4% in July, 4% in August, and 2% in September. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenues in the quarter, increased 7%, 6% on a daily basis. This daily sales growth was driven by 5 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from acquisitions. Daily sales increased 6% in July, 5% in August, and 5% in September. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States for the quarter. Light Manufacturing was up in the high single digits. Heavy Manufacturing, Commercial and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits. Government, Contractor and Retail were up in the low single digits, and Reseller was down in the low single digits. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada decreased 1%, 2% on a daily basis in U.S. dollars. In local currency, sales increased 4%, 2% on a daily basis. The 2% daily sales growth consisted primarily of 2 percentage points from volume. By month, daily sales on local currency increased 2% in July, 4% in August, and were flat in September. Sales performance in Canada was led by solid growth to customers in the oil and gas, forestry, light manufacturing and utilities end markets. Volume growth in Canada continues to be negatively affected by the weak global demand for Canadian commodities and the general softening of the Canadian economy. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, and represented 11% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for this group were up 1%, flat on a daily basis and consisted of 7 percentage points from volume and price, offset by a 7 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to revenue growth in Mexico and Europe, along with the strong growth from Zoro Tools, our U.S.-based online business. Sales for the business in Japan grew in the mid-teens in local currency. Due to the significant weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar, sales for this business decreased in the high single digits in U.S. dollars. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 20 selling days in September of 2013 versus 19 days in the same month of 2012. Company sales increased 2% on a daily basis in September of 2013 versus September of 2012. The daily sales growth in September included 3 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool acquisition, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. In the United States, September's daily sales increased 5%, driven by 4 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from Techni-Tool. September customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the high single digits; Commercial and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits; Retail was up in the low single digits; Contractor was flat, and Government and Reseller were down in the low single digits. Sales performance for our federal government business, which represents approximately 25% of our government business in the United States declined in the high single digits. Sequestration and the government shutdown remain significant headwinds for our federal government business. In contrast, sales for our state and local government businesses grew in the low single digits in September. Daily sales in Canada for September decreased 6% in U.S. dollars, and were flat in local currency. The sales performance in Canada was led by solid growth to customers in the oil and gas, light manufacturing and agriculture end markets, offset by a decline in sales to the heavy manufacturing, construction, retail and commercial end markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses decreased 4% in September, consisting of 3 percentage points from volume and price that was more than offset by a 7 percentage point drag from unfavorable foreign exchange. October will be the first month with sales contribution from the E&R Industrial Inc. acquisition completed in the 2013 third quarter. This business is expected to add approximately 200 basis points to company sales growth for the next 12 months. Excluding the incremental sales from E&R, daily sales growth in the month of October is currently trending above the 4% daily sales growth rate reported for the third quarter. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by a reportable segment. As a reminder, results in this discussion will exclude the $76 million in reserves or $0.66 per share we announced in last year's quarter related to litigation with the General Services Administration and the United States Postal Service. Operating earnings in the United States increased 6% versus the 2012 third quarter. This performance was driven by the 7% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter decreased 30 basis points versus the prior year driven by strong growth and share gain among large customers, which carry lower margins. In addition, unlike the past 2 years, the company did not implement mid-year price increases due to a lower inflationary environment in 2013. Operating expenses grew at a slightly slower rate than sales, despite the increase in incremental growth-related spending of $36 million, on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising. The operating margin for the U.S. segment decreased 20 basis points to 18% versus the prior year. Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 7% versus the prior year in U.S. dollars. The lower operating performance was primarily the result of approximately $3.5 million in incremental spending for the new IT system scheduled for installation in late 2014. Excluding the IT investment, the business generated positive operating leverage. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points. The gross profit margin improvement was due to cost savings from freight consolidation and higher supplier rebates. The operating margin in Canada decreased 80 basis points to 11.7% versus the prior year. The Other Businesses generated $6 million in operating earnings in the 2013 third quarter versus $9 million in the 2012 third quarter. The earnings decline for the quarter was primarily driven by weaker performance in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, partially offset by improved earnings from Zoro Tools. Strong earnings growth in Japan was essentially offset by the relative weakness of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.9 million in the 2013 third quarter versus $4 million in the 2012 third quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 38% versus 37.1% in the 2012 quarter. The increase was primarily due to lower earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We are currently projecting an effective tax rate for the full year 2013 of 37.4% to 37.8%. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $354 million, up 5% versus $33.8 million in 2012. Cash flow in the 2013 quarter benefited from higher earnings and lower inventory purchases versus the prior year. The company used the cash to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $65 million versus $59 million in 2012. We paid dividends of $65 million, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in the April of 2013. In addition, we bought back 300,000 shares of stock for $77 million and ended the quarter with 4.2 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $142 million to shareholders in the quarter. As reported in our 2013 third quarter earnings release, we narrowed our sales and EPS guidance for full year 2013. We now expect 5% to 6% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.45 to $11.65. This guidance includes E&R Industrial, which we will begin reporting in the 2013 fourth quarter. As a reminder, we expect E&R to be earnings neutral in 2013, but will result in gross and operating margin dilution as we will detail in just a moment. For purposes of comparison, we have excluded the $0.25 per share in restructuring charges recorded in the 2012 fourth quarter. With that as a backdrop, let's take a look at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. The primary changes since July relate to slower growth outside the United States, and lower expectations for price inflation. We now expect price inflation to only contribute 1 percentage point to sales growth versus the 2 percentage points included in our previous guidance. Price in the 2013 third quarter rounded down to 0 and we do not anticipate any interim price increases in 2013, unlike the past few years. The new guidance implies roughly 6% to 8% daily sales growth in the fourth quarter, including $50 million in revenue from the E&R Industrial acquisition. Excluding E&R, sales are expected to grow 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter. Moving on to gross profit margins. We are forecasting gross margin expansion of about 30 basis points for the full year versus 2012. Keep in mind that much of the gross margin expansion was realized in the first half of the year, when gross margins increased 60 basis points over prior year. We are expecting gross margins in the fourth quarter to decrease by 40 basis points. If you exclude E&R, our guidance includes approximately 20 basis points of gross margin expansion. We anticipate that our share gains will continue to come from our larger, lower margin customers. While the resulting earnings growth is substantial, it continues to create negative mix. Lastly, we are squarely in a period of low inflation and are not seeing much product cost inflation. As a result, we are also not expecting any price inflation for the remainder of 2013. Let's take a look at company operating margin. We expect full year operating margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points. Again, this expansion was front-end loaded, with 95 basis points of improvement coming in the first half of the year. For the 2013 fourth quarter, we are forecasting that operating margins will decline 20 basis points on the low end, and increase 50 basis points on the high end. Excluding E&R, operating margins are expected to increase 10 basis points on the low end, and 80 basis points on the high end. Keep in mind, the relatively wide range of outcomes in the 2013 fourth quarter is a reflection of the direct relationship between our volume growth and our ability to generate productivity savings. The better the growth, the stronger the productivity. Our assumptions include $36 million in incremental growth spending in the fourth quarter. Details are provided in Exhibit 3. As we noted in the 2013 third quarter release, work is underway to build out a new enterprise system for the businesses in Canada and Mexico. Although the majority of the cost for this project will be incurred in 2014, margins in Canada are expected to decline given $4.5 million in IT spending forecasted for the 2013 fourth quarter. Finally, we are forecasting foreign exchange to represent $0.09 per share drag for the full year, including $0.03 per share in the 2013 fourth quarter. Looking at the full year, 2013 should be another record year with earnings per share growing at twice the rate of sales under both our high and low guidance scenarios. Keep in mind that 2013 will be the tale of 2 halves, with strong margin expansion in the first half, followed by much more modest expectations in the second half tied to limited gross margin expansion and higher spending on growth and infrastructure initiatives. And those investments, over the long term, will better position Grainger to gain more share, build additional scale and lead the consolidation of the large and fragmented MRO market. To conclude, please mark your calendar for the following important dates: on Tuesday, November 12, we plan to release October sales. And on Wednesday, November 13, we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting. This year's event will be held at our new national distribution center in Minooka, Illinois. This facility is 1 million square feet and it's highly automated.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-17 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations
Laura D. Brown: Hi, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2013 Second Quarter Results. Please also reference our 2013 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 17, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this podcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Today, we reported results for the 2013 second quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 6% versus the 2012 second quarter. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings increased 11%, and net earnings increased 14%. Earnings per share were $3.03 for the quarter, an increase of 15% versus the 2012 second quarter. The 2013 second quarter included a $0.03 per share tax benefit, which we will discuss later in the podcast. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share increased 14%. We also narrowed our guidance ranges for both 2013 sales and earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of the podcast. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins increased 50 basis points to 44% versus 43.5% in 2012, primarily driven by Canada and the Other Businesses. Company operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.7% versus 14% a year ago. Both reportable segments and the Other Businesses contributed to the increase in company operating margin, which was driven by the 6% sales increase, higher gross margins and operating expense leverage. Operating expenses increased 5%, including $37 million in incremental growth-related spending versus the 2012 second quarter. These growth investments include additional sales coverage, eCommerce, inventory management, advertising, IT systems and expansion of the company's distribution center network. We are continuing to aggressively invest in our growth drivers and are now estimating incremental growth-related spending of $150 million for 2013, $10 million less than we forecasted in the first quarter. The $10 million reduction in our estimate is largely driven by timing. Given that we are at the midpoint, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our growth drivers. We added approximately 75 new sales representatives in the United States and expect to hire another 100 by year end. In addition, we've aggressively expanded our sales force in several of our international businesses, including Canada, Brazil and Mexico, where we've hired more than 70 new sales representatives year-to-date. Our eCommerce sales continue to grow at twice the rate of our other channels. For the first half of 2013, eCommerce sales represented 32% of total company sales, up 200 basis points from full year 2012. We added more than 6,200 KeepStock installations in the United States in the first half of the year and are still targeting 10,000 installations for the full year. Outside of the United States and primarily in Canada, we added nearly 1,400 new KeepStock installations in the first 6 months of the year. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2013 guidance and other key items. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 6%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 8% in April, 5% in May and 5% in June. As a reminder, April included a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Easter holiday. The 6% increase in sales in the quarter included 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price and 1 percentage point from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point drag from unfavorable foreign exchange. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%. This sales growth was driven by 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price and 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool business acquired on December 31, 2012. Daily sales increased 9% in April, 6% in May and 6% in June. The timing of the Easter holiday contributed 1 percentage point to daily sales growth in April. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Light Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits. Heavy Manufacturing, Commercial, Contractor and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits. Government and Retail were up in the low-single digits, and Reseller was down in the low-single digits. Our continued success with manufacturing customers further reinforces our commitment to add products and services to best serve customers in this important end market. The addition of more sales representatives, more products and more KeepStock installations are all contributing to share gain. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. The 3% sales growth in U.S. dollars consisted of 2 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from favorable timing of the Easter holiday and 1 percentage point from sales of products used by customers following the flooding in Alberta, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 9% in April, 2% in May and 3% in June. The timing of the Easter holiday and an extra selling day in Canada versus the prior year contributed 5 percentage points to daily sales growth in April. Sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth to customers in the Forestry, Construction and Light Manufacturing end markets. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, and represented 11% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for this group increased 5%, which consisted of 9 percentage points from volume and price and 2 percentage points from the acquired business in Brazil, partially offset by a 6 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to solid revenue growth in Mexico and the timing of the Brazil acquisition in the 2012 second quarter. In local currency, sales for the business in Japan grew in the high teens, but that growth was offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 20 selling days in June of 2013 versus 21 days in the same month of 2012. Company sales increased 5% on a daily basis in June of 2013 versus June of 2012. The daily sales growth in June included 4 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price, 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool acquisition, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. In the United States, June daily sales increased 6%, driven by 4 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from Techni-Tool. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light Manufacturing and Commercial were up in the high-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing, Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits; Natural Resources and Contractor were up in the low-single digits; and Reseller was down in the low-single digits. June is the fiscal year end for many state governments. Our Government business benefited from strong growth among state government customers. In fact, daily sales to state and local government grew in the high-single digits for the month of June. Sales performance for our federal government business improved sequentially, but declined in the low-single digits. Sequestration remains a headwind for our federal government business. Daily sales in Canada for June increased 3% in U.S. dollars and in local currency. The 3% daily sales growth consisted of 1 percentage point from volume and 2 percentage points from sales of flood-related products. Sales growth in Canada was driven by solid performance in the Forestry, Government and Light Manufacturing end markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 4% in June, consisting of 11 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 7% drag from unfavorable foreign exchange. In local currency, daily sales for our business in Japan grew in the mid-20s, but were offset by a weaker Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Daily sales growth in the month of July is currently trending below the growth rate reported for June, primarily due to a very light selling day on Friday, July 5. Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reportable segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 9% versus the 2012 second quarter, while the operating margin increased 40 basis points to 18.2%. This performance was driven by the 7% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter were essentially flat versus the prior year. We were able to increase prices above product cost inflation. However, this was effectively offset by unfavorable selling mix tied to stronger sales to large customers. Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales and included $33 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising. Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 11% versus the prior year in U.S. dollars. The improvement in operating performance was driven by higher sales and higher gross margins. Gross margins increased 140 basis points to 39.9%. The gross profit margin improvement was due to cost savings from freight consolidation, higher supplier rebates and favorable mix. Approximately half of the improvements are expected to continue into future periods. The operating margin in Canada increased 90 basis points to 12.9%. The Other Businesses generated $13 million in operating earnings in the 2013 second quarter versus $11 million in the 2012 second quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by earnings growth in Japan and Europe, partially offset by lower earnings, and in some cases, larger losses for some of the smaller businesses in Asia and Latin America. Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.4 million in the 2013 second quarter versus $2.3 million in the 2012 second quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 36.5% versus 37.9% in the 2012 quarter. The 2013 second quarter tax rate reflected a benefit from a resolution of foreign tax matters in the current period that resulted in a benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.03 per share. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.3%. The company continues to project an effective tax rate for the year of 37.3% to 37.7%. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $210 million, up 59% versus $132 million in 2012. Cash flow in the 2013 quarter benefited from higher earnings and lower inventory purchases versus the prior year. The company used the cash to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million versus $56 million in 2012. We paid dividends of $67 million, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2013. In addition, we bought back 521,000 shares of stock for $133 million and ended the quarter with 4.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $200 million to shareholders in the quarter. As reported in our 2013 second quarter earnings release, we lowered the top end of our 2013 sales guidance by 1 percentage point and raised the bottom end of our 2013 earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share. We now expect 5% to 8% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.40 to $12. Let's look more closely at our current expectations. And let's begin with sales. The primary change since April relates to foreign exchange. We are now forecasting foreign exchange to be a 1 percentage point drag on sales for the full year versus the 0 to negative 1 embedded in our previous sales guidance. The new guidance range implies roughly 4% to 10% daily sales growth for the remainder of the year. We have 1 additional selling day in the 2013 third quarter, although selling days for the full year are equal to 2012. Moving on to gross profit margins. We are forecasting gross margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points for the full year. Keep in mind that much of the gross margin expansion was realized in the first half of the year, with gross margins increasing 60 basis points. Therefore, we are expecting gross margins in the back half of the year to increase a more modest 10 to 20 basis points. Unlike 2012, we are not planning any interim price increases for the remainder of the year given the low inflation environment for commodities. As we saw in the U.S. business during the second quarter, stronger sales growth to larger customers with lower pricing will continue to create some headwinds. We expect full year operating margin expansion of 35 to 65 basis points. This expansion was front-end loaded, with 95 basis points of improvement coming in the first half of the year. For the second half of the year, we are forecasting that operating margins will decline 25 basis points on the low end and will increase 40 basis points on the high end. Incremental growth spending, now estimated to be $150 million for the year will accelerate. Details are provided in Exhibit 3. Work is underway to build out a new enterprise system for the businesses in Canada and Mexico. Costs for the project are back-end loaded, but could reduce second half 2013 operating margins in Canada by 100 to 150 basis points depending on the pace of spending. Finally, we are now forecasting foreign exchange, primarily related to the Japanese yen, to represent a $0.07 to $0.10 per share drag for the full year. To summarize, 2013 will be a tale of 2 halves. In the first half of the year, we enjoyed nice operating margin expansion, fueled by robust gross margins and strong earnings leverage. As our growth initiative and SAP project spending accelerates in the back half of 2013, coupled with limited gross margin expansion, we are expecting much more modest operating leverage. Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. We plan to release July sales on Monday, August 12. We are scheduled to report third quarter results on Wednesday, October 16. And finally, you are invited to attend our Annual Analyst Meeting on Wednesday, November 13, which will be held at our brand new distribution center in Minooka, Illinois. This new facility is 1 million square feet and is highly automated. Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-04-16 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations
Laura D. Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's first quarter 2013 results. Please also reference our 2013 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Today, we reported results for the 2013 first quarter and raised our 2013 sales and earnings guidance. We raised the low end of the guidance ranges to reflect the solid start to the year and account for an increase in growth spending. We now expect sales to grow 5% to 9% and are forecasting EPS of $11.30 to $12 for the full year 2013. At the end of this recording, we'll talk more about our revised guidance and assumptions. Company sales for the quarter increased 4% versus the 2012 first quarter, 6% on a daily basis. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, 1 less than the previous year. Operating earnings and net earnings increased 13%. Earnings per share were $2.94 for the quarter, an increase of 14% versus the 2012 first quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins increased 80 basis points to 45.2% versus 44.4% in 2012, primarily driven by the United States segment. Company operating margin increased 120 basis points to 15.1% versus 13.9% a year ago. The earnings growth was driven by the 4% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses increased 3%, including $22 million in incremental growth-related spending versus the 2012 first quarter. These growth investments include additional sales coverage, eCommerce, advertising, IT systems and expansion of the company's distribution center network. We took a cautious approach to spending in the 2013 first quarter given the uncertainties surrounding the threat of the fiscal cliff at the end of December. Given a modestly improving economic backdrop and solid performance in the quarter, we are increasing the estimated amount of incremental growth-related spending to $160 million for the year. We had originally forecasted $135 million in incremental growth-related investment in 2013, but also bracketed this number with $25 million on either side based on sales growth. We view our commitment to a higher growth spending as an example of our leadership in the MRO industry and an attractive opportunity to gain market share over the long term. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with the discussion of our 2013 guidance and other key items. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 4% on a reported basis and 6% on a daily basis. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 8% in January, 6% in February and 3% in March. Daily sales growth in March was affected by the timing of the Easter holiday, which I will cover in more detail in the March sales section. The 6% increase in daily sales in the quarter included 3 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price, 1 percentage point from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point drag from foreign exchange. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 77% of total company revenue in the quarter increased 4%, 6% on a daily basis. The 6% daily sales growth for the quarter was driven by 3 percentage points from price, 2 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool business acquired on December 31, 2012. Daily sales increased 7% in January, 7% in February and 4% in March. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Light manufacturing was up in the high-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing, Commercial, Contractor, Retail and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits; Government was up in the low-single digits; and Reseller was down in the low-single digits. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. On a daily basis in U.S. dollars, sales increased 5% and consisted of 8 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday and a 1 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 8% in January, 8% in February and 3% in March. Sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth to customers in the Construction, Commercial, Forestry, Oil and Gas and Light Manufacturing end markets. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations, primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 4%, 5% on a daily basis, which consisted of 6 percentage points from volume and price and 4 percentage points from the acquired business in Brazil, partially offset by a 5 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to solid revenue growth in Japan and Mexico, coupled with incremental sales from Brazil. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at March, which was affected by the timing of the Easter holiday and customer spending pullbacks related to sequestration within the Government end market. There were 21 selling days in March of 2013 versus 22 days in the same month of 2012. Company sales increased 3% on a daily basis in March of 2013 versus March of 2012. The daily sales growth in March included 3 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price, 1 percentage point from the acquisitions, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday and 1 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. In the United States, March daily sales increased 4%. This increase was due to a 3 percentage point increase from price, 1 percentage point increase in volume, 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool acquisition, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday. March customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were up in the mid-single digits; Commercial and Retail were up in the low-single digits; Natural Resources was flat; Government was down in the low-single digits; and Reseller was down in the mid-single digits. Uncertainty in the United States surrounding sequestration contributed to a decline in sales to the Government end market. Sales weakness in the Government end market was driven by Federal Government agencies, while sales to state and local government increased versus March 2012. As a point of reference, Government represented 15% of U.S. sales in the 2013 first quarter. Daily sales in Canada for March were flat in U.S. dollars, up 3% in local currency. The flat daily sales consisted of 8 percentage points from volume, offset by a 5 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday and 3 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. The Canadian business was closed on Good Friday, whereas the U.S. business was open. As a reminder, we use the number of selling days in the United States as a basis for our calculation of daily sales company-wide. Sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the Construction, Commercial, Forestry, Government and Light Manufacturing end markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 3% in March, consisting of 6 percentage points from volume and price; 5 percentage points from the acquisition in Brazil, partially offset by negative 7 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange; and 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday. In local currency, sales for the business in Japan grew in the high teens, but most of the growth was offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Daily sales growth in the month of April is currently trending in the high-single digits. As a reminder, the comparison should be more favorable as Easter was in April of 2012. If you normalize both March and April for Easter, daily sales growth in April is running slightly ahead of March. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reportable segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 11% versus the 2012 first quarter, while the operating margin increased 110 basis points to 18.7%. This performance was driven by the 4% sales growth, higher gross profit margins and positive operating expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 80 basis points driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation and growth of private label products, partially offset by unfavorable selling mix. Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales and included $20 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising. Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 11% versus the prior year in both U.S. dollars and local currency. The improvement in operating performance was driven by higher sales and positive operating expense leverage, despite an incremental $2 million in growth-related spending. Gross margins in Canada were essentially flat versus the prior year. The 4% growth in sales and lower operating expenses contributed to a 70 basis point increase in the operating margin to 11.6%. The Other Businesses generated $8 million in operating earnings in the 2013 first quarter versus $11 million in the 2012 first quarter. The decline in earnings performance for the quarter versus the prior year was primarily driven by operating losses for the acquired business in Brazil and lower earnings for some of the smaller businesses in Asia and Latin America. The earnings decline was partially offset by strong earnings growth in Japan and operating earnings growth in Europe, related to lower expenses from restructuring actions taken in the 2012 fourth quarter. Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.3 million in the 2013 first quarter versus $2.5 million in the 2012 first quarter. For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2013 was 37.3% versus 37.4% in 2012. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of 37.3% to 37.7% for the full year 2013. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $176 million, up 66% versus $106 million in 2012. Cash flow in the 2013 quarter benefited from higher earnings, lower inventory purchases and a lower management incentive payout versus the prior year. We used the cash to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders, share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million versus $41 million in 2012. We paid dividends of $57 million reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2012. In addition, we bought back 315,000 shares of stock for $70 million and ended the quarter with 5.0 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $127 million to shareholders in the quarter. As reported in our 2013 first quarter earnings release, we raised the low end of our 2013 sales guidance by 2 percentage points, and we increased the low end of our 2013 earnings per share guidance by $0.45. We now expect 5% to 9% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.30 to $12. Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations. Let's begin with sales. The new guidance range for daily sales growth implies roughly 5% to 10% daily sales growth for the remainder of the year. In the absence of any material changes in the economy, we expect reported daily sales growth to accelerate slightly through the year, driven by contributions from our growth programs and easier comparisons. We anniversary-ed the Brazil acquisition in May of 2013. We have 1 additional selling day in the 2013 third quarter, although selling days for the full year are equal to 2012. And we are now forecasting a range of negative 1 to 0 percentage points related to foreign exchange. Moving on to gross profit margins. We are forecasting gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points for the full year. Gross profit margins in the second quarter should be above last year's second quarter, but below the 2013 first quarter. Consistent with prior years, the first quarter included supplier support provided for our annual customer trade shows. As a result, both gross profit and operating expenses, as a percent of sales, are inflated by about 100 basis points. Unlike 2012, we are not expecting any interim price increases for the remainder of the year given the low inflation environment for commodities. We're also expecting that stronger sales growth to large customers with lower pricing will create headwinds, particularly in the back half of the year. Operating expenses should generate 20 to 30 basis points of cost leverage for the full year. Incremental growth-related spending of $160 million for the year will accelerate and will drive sequential increases in operating expenses for the remaining 3 quarters. Roughly 40% of the incremental growth spending will occur in the front half of the year with the remaining 60% hitting in the second half. Work is underway to build out a new enterprise system for the businesses in Canada and Mexico. Costs for the project are back-end loaded, but could affect 2013 operating margins in Canada by 50 to 100 basis points, depending on the pace of spending. We expect 40 to 60 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year versus 2012 through the combination of gross margin expansion and better cost leverage. Finally, we are now forecasting foreign exchange, primarily related to the Japanese yen, to be a headwind of $0.05 to $0.07 per share for the full year. Please mark your calendar for the following events scheduled during the next 4 weeks. On April 24, we will host our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The script from that presentation will be available on our website following this event. On May 7, Court Carruthers, Senior Vice President and President of Grainger United States, will present at the Robert W. Baird Growth Stock Conference in Chicago. The event will be webcast. And finally, we will release April sales on Friday, May 10. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at (847) 535-0409; Casey Darby at (847) 535-0099; or me, at (847) 535-0881. Thank you.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-01-24 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Director of Investor Relations
Laura D. Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's fourth quarter 2012 results. Please also reference our 2012 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 24, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Today, we reported record results for the year 2012 and reiterated our earnings per share guidance for 2013. We'll discuss 2012 in more detail, as well as comment on January's strong sales start. At the very end of December, we experienced a dramatic slowdown in sales, contributing to quarterly performance that was below our guidance. In addition, there were 3 items included in our quarterly results that were not part of our November 14, 2012, earnings guidance: at $0.18 per share charge, primarily related to streamlining operations in Europe, India and China to improve the long-term performance of these businesses; a $0.03 per share charge related to the closure of branches in the United States; and a $0.04 per share impairment charge related to our Alliance Energy Solutions business acquired in 2009. The impairment was caused by lower-than-expected operating performance. A schedule detailing these items can be found in the earnings release. These 3 items combined represented a $0.25 reduction to earnings per share, resulting in adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.42. As a reminder, the 2011 fourth quarter included a $0.16 per share charge from the closure of 27 branches in the U.S. business and a $0.07 per share gain from the sale of our 49% ownership in a joint venture in Korea. These 2 items in 2011 represented a $0.09 net reduction to earnings per share, resulting in adjusted EPS of $2.13. Excluding the items noted above, net earnings for the 2012 quarter increased 12% and the earnings per share increased 14% versus the prior year. So why did we fall below the low end of our EPS guidance or $2.55 issued on November 14 of last year? There were 2 primary factors: Number 1, first, the sudden and dramatic sales slowdown in the last 1/3 of December did not allow us to pull back on operating expenses sufficiently to mitigate the negative operating leverage. To put this in perspective, in the U.S. business, we were anticipating 7% daily sales growth in the first 2/3 of December and 1% daily sales growth in the final 1/3 of the month. Actual results were much lower with 5% daily sales growth in the first 2/3 of the month and a 13% daily sales decline in the last 1/3 of the month, driven by the timing of the holidays and concerns regarding the economy and the fiscal cliff. Second, legal, M&A and health care costs related to long-term disability came in above our forecast. Company sales for the quarter increased 7% versus the 2011 fourth quarter. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, one more than the previous year. Given the timing of the holidays in December, the additional selling day added a minimal amount of sales dollars and created the headwind to sales on a daily basis, which increased 6%. On a reported basis, operating earnings increased 17%, while net earnings increased 5%. Items below the operating line, such as other income/expense and tax rate contributed to earnings performance and are discussed later in the podcast. Reported earnings per share were $2.17 for the quarter, representing an increase of 6% versus the 2011 fourth quarter. In a few moments, we will more fully analyze our sales results for the quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins were flat at 43.6% versus 2011 as forecasted in our 2012 third quarter podcast. We'll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. Company operating margin increased 90 basis points to 11.6% versus 10.7% a year ago. The increase in earnings growth was driven by the 7% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses grew 4%, including $1 million in incremental growth-related spending over the 2011 fourth quarter to fund the growth programs, including new Territory Sales Representatives, e-commerce, advertising and incremental expenses for the company's distribution center network. Incremental growth spending for the full year 2012 was $71 million versus 2011. A schedule summarizing incremental growth spending for 2011 and 2012 can be found in Exhibit 3 of this podcast. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of December; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2013 guidance and other key items. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a daily basis. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 6% in October, 8% in November and 2% in December. The 6% increase in daily sales in the quarter included 3 percentage points from price, 2 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from Hurricane Sandy-related sales, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline attributable to the timing of the December holidays and extended customer shutdowns tied to concerns about the economy and the fiscal cliff, as explained in the earnings release. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which account for 75% of total company revenue, increased 5% in the quarter, 4% on a daily basis. The 4% daily sales growth for the quarter was driven by 3 percentage points from price, 1 percentage point from volume and 1 percentage point from Hurricane Sandy-related sales, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the December holidays. Daily sales increased 4% in October, 6% in November and declined 1% in December. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Here is the sales performance for each respective customer end market in the quarter. Light Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Commercial were up in the mid-single digits; Government and Retail were up in the low-single digits; Reseller was flat; Contractor was down in the low-single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the mid-single digits. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 13% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. On a daily basis, sales increased 13% and consisted of 8 percentage points from volume, 4 percentage points from foreign exchange, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the December holidays. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 12% in October, 8% in November and 5% in December. Sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Western provinces, led by the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Construction and Utilities end markets. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again this group includes our operations, primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 12% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 16%, 14% on a daily basis, which consisted of 13 percentage points from volume and 5 percentage points from acquisitions, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1 percentage point decline attributable to the timing of the holidays. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at December, which was worse than expected because of the timing of the holidays and customer spending pullbacks related to the fiscal cliff. As mentioned previously, in the first 2/3 of the month, sales growth was tracking in the mid-single digits, but sales declined in the last 1/3 of the month versus the prior year. We attribute some of this to the timing of the Christmas and New Year's holidays. In addition, we observed the concerns surrounding the economy and the fiscal cliff resulted in businesses and institutions implementing spending moratoriums. Many customers we spoke with closed their facilities during the back part of December and furloughed employees for an extended period over the holidays. There were 20 selling days in December of 2012 versus 21 days in the same month of 2011. Total company sales increased 2% on a daily basis in December of 2012 versus December of 2011. The daily sales growth in December included 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price, 1 percentage point from acquisitions, partially offset by a 4 percentage point decline from the timing of the holidays and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. In the United States, December sales declined 1%. This decline was primarily related to a 4 percentage points decline from the timing of the December holidays and concerns about the fiscal cliff and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point increase in volume and a 2 percentage point increase from price. December customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Heavy and Light Manufacturing were up in the low-single digits; Government, Commercial, Retail and Reseller were down in the low-single digits; Contractor was down in the mid-single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the high-single digits. Daily sales in Canada for December increased 9% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in local currency. The 9% daily sales growth consisted of 6 percentage points from volume, 4 percentage points from foreign exchange, 1 percentage point from price, 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline due to the timing of the holidays. Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Construction and Utilities end markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 14% in December, consisting of 16 percentage points from volume and 4 percentage points from acquisitions, partially offset by a negative 4 percentage points from the timing of the holidays and a negative 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Daily sales growth in the first 3 business days of January followed the same trend as the back 1/3 of December. Since that time, sales have rebounded nicely and are trending in the mid- to high-single digits. Keep in mind that we are up against a very strong comparison in January. Daily sales were up 17% in January of 2012 versus the prior year. We may be benefiting from some catch-up from the sales decline in late December, though it is difficult to determine for sure. January of 2013 will be the first month we include the incremental sales from Techni-Tool, the business we acquired on December 31, which had 2011 sales of $88 million. Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reporting segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 17% versus the 2011 fourth quarter, and the U.S. operating margin increased 160 basis points to 16.2%. Excluding $10 million and $18 million in charges during the 2012 and 2011 quarters, operating earnings increased 12%,, and the U.S. operating margin increased 110 basis points to 16.8%. This performance was driven by the 5% sales growth, higher gross profit margins and positive expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points, driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer mix. Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales and included $1 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising. Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 2% versus the prior year, down 2% in local currency. The increase in operating earnings was driven by favorable foreign exchange and modest expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins. Gross margins in Canada decreased 150 basis points versus the prior year. The decline was primarily due to unfavorable customer and product sales mix. Lower gross margins and higher operating expenses contributed to a 130 basis point decline in operating margins to 10.7%. Operating performance for our Other Businesses declined versus a year ago posting a loss of $10.4 million for the quarter versus operating earnings of $5 million in 2011. During the quarter, we decided to implement the following structural changes to the businesses in Europe, India and China to improve long-term performance, resulting in $13.7 million in restructuring charges. In Europe, we closed 6 underperforming shops and reduced headcount to better align the business with the weak economy in Western Europe. In India and China, we are streamlining these businesses by narrowing the product offering and by reducing headcount. Excluding these charges, the Other Businesses would have generated $3.3 million in operating earnings in the 2012 fourth quarter. This performance was primarily driven by the businesses in Japan and Mexico, partially offset by modest operating losses from the businesses in Brazil and Europe before the restructuring charges. Below the operating line, the 2012 fourth quarter had $5 million in other expense versus $5 million in other income for the 2011 fourth quarter. This rounds to a $9 million negative swing that was primarily due to an $8 million gain on the sale of our 49% ownership in MRO Korea that was recognized in the 2011 fourth quarter. In addition, interest expense net of interest income was $5 million in the 2012 fourth quarter versus $2 million in the 2011 quarter. The increase in interest expense was related to higher average borrowings, higher interest rates and capital leases for the acquired business in Europe. For the quarter the effective tax rate in 2012 was 37.6% versus 32.9% in 2011. The fourth quarter of 2011 included a benefit from the tax law change in Japan. For the year, the effective tax rate in 2012 was 37.5% versus 36.6% in 2011. In addition to the 2011 fourth quarter favorability, the company settled various tax reviews providing further benefit to the 2011 effective tax rate. Excluding these benefits in 2011, the effective tax rate was 38.1%. The effective tax rate in 2012 benefited primarily from a lower blended state tax rate. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of 37.3% to 37.7% for the year 2013. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $240 million versus $186 million in 2011. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business, fund an acquisition and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $95 million versus $66 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $58 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2012. In addition, we bought back 228,000 shares of stock for $44 million and ended the quarter with 5.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $102 million to shareholders in the quarter. At our Analyst Meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2013. Today, we reiterated that earnings per share guidance of $10.85 to $12 reflecting confidence in our strategy and industry-leading service. We also raised the 2013 sales guidance to a new range of 3% to 9% growth to reflect the increase in sales from the December 31, 2012, acquisition of Techni-Tool, Inc., which had sales in 2011 of $88 million. Here are a few additional considerations as you refine your models. For the first quarter 2013, the sales comparison in the 2013 first quarter is the most difficult of the year. We reported 16% sales growth in the 2012 first quarter. Second, we lose a selling day in the 2013 first quarter as we will have 63 selling days in 2013 versus 64 in 2012. Good Friday falls in the 2013 first quarter. In 2012, the Easter holiday fell in the second quarter. Business typically slows around the Easter holiday with Good Friday representing a very light day. Finally, the company's annual trade shows held in the first quarter typically result in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year. For the full year 2013, sales comparisons get easier as we move through the year. We also anniversary the acquisition in Brazil in May of 2013. Incremental growth spending in 2013 versus 2012 is still estimated to be $135 million, plus or minus $25 million, depending on sales volume. And finally in aggregate, we are expecting 10 to 60 basis points of operating margin expansion versus 13.8% for 2012 after adjustments. Cost leverage should be better than our original forecast, while gross margin expansion will be muted by the addition of Techni-Tool. In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy to gain share and extend our leadership position in the large and fragmented MRO market. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for the release of January sales on Tuesday, February 12.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-10-16 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Director of Investor Relations
Laura D. Brown: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We will share with you some information regarding Grainger's Third Quarter 2012 Results via this audio webcast. Please also reference our 2012 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Before I discuss the quarter, I'd like to first highlight the $0.66 per share reserve for the expected settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which includes the following 2 parts: number one, a $70 million pretax charge for the proposed settlement in principle with the DOJ over the interpretation of contract language signed more than 10 years ago with the General Services Administration and the U.S. Postal Service; and second, a $6 million pretax reserve related to tax, freight and miscellaneous billings for these customers. We are close to having this longstanding dispute behind us. It is important to note that the proposed settlement does not any admission of wrongdoing by the company and avoids costly and lengthy litigation. The GSA contract dates back to 1999 and the government remains one of our larger customer end markets. As a case in point, throughout the multi-year audit, the government continued to buy from Grainger and in fact, increased its purchasing during that time. In 2011 alone, our sales to the GSA and the U.S. Postal Service totaled approximately $200 million. Additional information regarding this case can be found in the earnings release issued on October 16, along with previously filed 10-Qs and 10-Ks. Please note that the following analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of the $0.66 charge. From a segment presentation standpoint, the entire charge is recorded in the United States segment. We'll start with total company results and then take a closer look at our segments. Performance for the quarter was driven by sales growth and market share gains, coupled with strong gross margin expansion. Company sales increased 8% versus the 2011 third quarter. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, 1 less than the previous year, which cost us approximately $33 million to $38 million of revenue growth. Sales growth on a daily basis increased 10%. Operating earnings increased 9%, while net earnings increased 11%. Earnings per share, excluding the $0.66 charge, were $2.81 for the quarter, representing an increase of 12% versus the 2011 third quarter. It is important to note that one less selling day represented approximately $0.05 to $0.10 per share in lower earnings on an incremental basis. With fewer selling days, only expenses that are truly variable are avoided, while fixed and semi-variable costs must be absorbed by a lower sales base. In a few moments, we'll analyze our sales results for the quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 43.6% versus 43.2% in 2011. Our purchasing scale enables us to manage price changes in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We'll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. Company operating margin increased 20 basis points to 14.5% versus 14.3% a year ago. This improvement was driven by solid sales growth and gross margin expansion. Operating expenses grew 9%, including $19 million in incremental growth-related spending in the quarter and inclusion of operating expenses in Europe and Brazil, which we acquired since the start of the 2011 third quarter. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with the discussion of our revised 2012 guidance. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a daily basis. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 11% in July, 10% in August and 9% in September. The 10% daily sales growth for the quarter included 3 percentage points from acquisitions and a 1 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. We reached the anniversary of the acquisition of the business in Europe on August 31. Accordingly, the quarter includes 2 months of incremental sales and operating results. On an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions and foreign exchange, daily sales for the quarter increased 8%, with 4 percentage points from volume and 4 percentage points from price. Daily organic sales growth by month was as follows: 8% in July, 7% in August and 8% in September. Let's move onto sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which account for 77% of total company revenue, increased 4% in the quarter, 5% on a daily basis. The 5% sales growth consisted of 4% from price and 1% from volume. Daily sales in the United States increased 6% in July, 4% in August and 6% in September. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Our growth drivers, which include increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, enhancing our e-commerce capabilities and increasing our inventory management solutions are enabling Grainger to serve customers more effectively in the following end markets in the United States. Here is the sales performance for each respective customer end market in the quarter: Light and heavy manufacturing were up in the high single digits. Commercial and government were up in the mid-single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits. And Naturals Resources, reseller and contractors were down in the low single digits. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. On a daily basis, sales in local currency increased 13%, consisting of 11% volume growth and 2 percentage points from price. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 16% in July, 13% in August and 11% in September. From a customer standpoint, sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Western provinces led by the commercial, oil and gas, forestry, contractor and utilities end markets. Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 54%, which consisted of a 39-percentage-point contribution from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, 24 percentage points from volume led by strong growth in Japan and Mexico, partially offset by a 9-percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 19 selling days in September of 2012 versus 21 days in the same month of 2011. Total company sales increased 9% on a daily basis in September of 2012 versus September of 2011. The daily sales growth in September included 1 percentage point from the business acquired in Brazil. Organic sales increased 8% on a daily basis, consisting of 4% volume growth and 4 percentage points from price inflation. In the United States, September daily sales increased 6%. This growth consisted of 4 percentage points from price and 2 percentage points from volume. September customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Government, heavy and light manufacturing were up in the high single digits. Commercial was up in the mid-single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits. And natural resources, reseller and contractor where down in the low single digits. As we shared with our August sales release, the fiscal year end for the federal government ended in September. Thanks to our strong relationships with many of these government agencies, coupled with the value of the service we provide, we enjoyed a strong finish to the month of September. This level of growth to the government was achieved despite a decline in sales to the U.S. Postal Service related to its aggressive restructuring program. And as noted above, despite the lengthy government audit, we have continued to grow our business relationship with the government. Daily sales in Canada for September increased 14% in U.S. dollars, up 11% in local currency. The 11% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 10 percentage points for volume and 1 percentage point for price. Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the commercial, oil and gas, contractor and utilities end markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 25% in September, consisting of 6 percentage points from acquisitions, 24 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a negative 5 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Daily sales growth to date in October is currently trending slightly below the 8% organic daily growth posted in the third quarter. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reporting segment. Again, we have excluded the $0.66 per share charge described at the beginning of this podcast. Operating earnings in the United States increased 7% versus the 2011 third quarter, and the U.S. operating increased 50 basis points to 18.2%. This performance was driven by 4% sales growth and higher gross margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points, driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer mix. Operating expenses increased in line with the sales increase and were primarily driven by $19 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising. Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 37% versus the prior year, up 38% in local currency. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins, and positive expense leverage, contributed to operating margins increasing 240 basis points to 12.5%. Gross margins increased 140 basis points, with roughly 2/3 of the expansion coming from the timing of supplier rebates and advertising credits. Operating performance for our Other Businesses declined versus a year ago, posting operating earnings of $9 million for the quarter versus $11 million in 2011. Strong performance improvement in Japan and Mexico was partially offset by losses from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, along with losses at some of our startup businesses in developing markets. The operating loss in Europe was primarily driven by lower sales tied to the economy and lower gross margins related to unfavorable customer mix. Contributing to the loss in Europe were adjustments tied to the completion of the purchase price allocation. In Brazil, continued investments in expanding the sales force and product offering contributed to a small operating loss from this newly acquired business. Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $4 million in the 2012 third quarter versus $2 million in the 2011 third quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates in 2012 versus 2011. In addition, interest expense adjustments related to capital leases for the acquired business in Europe also contributed to the increase in 2012. The effective tax rate for the 2012 third quarter was 37.1% versus 38.7% in 2011. The lower rate was primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate. As a reminder, we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2012 to be in the range of 37.4% to 37.7%. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $338 million versus $251 million in 2011. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $59 million versus $47 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $57 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of this year. In addition, we bought back 421,000 shares of stock for $85 million and ended the quarter with 5.6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $142 million to shareholders in the quarter. On July 18, 2012, in our second quarter earnings podcast, we indicated that if economic growth slows and/or the dollar continues to strengthen, the lower end of our sales range is more probable than the higher end. As reported in our 2012 third quarter earnings release, we slightly lowered and narrowed our 2012 sales guidance to a new range of 11% to 12% growth. At the same time, we reiterated our 2012 earnings per share guidance of $10.50 to $10.80. Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations. First, we are forecasting daily sales growth of 6% to 9% in the fourth quarter. While we gain an extra selling day in the 2012 fourth quarter versus the 2011 quarter, the holiday calendar will be working against us in December. Both Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Tuesdays. So we will be open for business on Monday, December 24, and Monday, December 31, but are forecasting a minimal sales contribution on either day. Second, our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter should approximate the 43.6% reported for the 2012 third quarter. Third, we are forecasting strong operating margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter as we lap heavy investment spending in the prior year quarter. The absolute level of spending should be on par with growth spending in the 2012 third quarter and relatively small on an incremental basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Fourth, while our business in Canada posted strong performance in the 2012 third quarter, we are forecasting more moderate sales growth and margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter. Going forward, we will be investing in the foundational elements of the business, namely supply chain and information technology to support the impressive growth of this $1 billion business. In addition, we'll also begin to invest in growth drivers to accelerate market share gains primarily in Eastern Canada, which represents nearly 70% of the country's market opportunity. Fifth, the performance of our Other Businesses should continue to be driven primarily by Japan and Mexico. Conversely, we expect both Europe and Brazil to be slightly dilutive in the 2012 fourth quarter. Sixth, we expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind on both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% for the full year. In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy to gain share and extend our leadership position in the large and fragmented MRO market. We will continue to invest in what matters to our customers, more products and services, more sales coverage and enhanced e-commerce capabilities, to provide outstanding customer service. At the same time, we will continue to drive margin expansion by growing our private label program and harvesting productivity through our continuous improvement programs, all with the objective of delivering solid returns to shareholders. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for the release of October sales on Monday, November 12, and our Annual Analyst Meeting on November 14.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-07-18 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown – Senior Vice President, Communications William D. Chapman – Senior Director, IR
Analysts: [No Q&A Session for this event].
Laura Brown: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me today is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to share with you some information regarding Grainger’s second quarter 2012 results via this audio web cast. Please also reference our 2012 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 18th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this web cast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.
. : As a result, we reiterated our 2012 sales growth guidance of 12 to 14% and raised the bottom end of our earnings per-share guidance as referenced in today’s earnings release. We will now expect EPS of $10.50 to $10.80 for the full year 2012. At the end of this recording we’ll talk more about our guidance and related assumptions. We’ll start with total company results, and then take a closer look at our segments. Company sales increased 12% versus the 2011 second quarter. We had 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings increased 18 %, while net earnings increased 12 %. As highlighted in the earnings release, earnings per share of $2.63 for the quarter represents an all-time company record and represents a 12% increase versus 2011. The 2011 quarter included a $0.12 per-share benefit from the settlement of tax examinations; excluding this benefit, the earnings per share increased 18 % versus 2011. In a few moments we’ll analyze our sales results for the quarter. Let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 43.5 %. Our purchasing scale enables us to manage price changes in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We’ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. It is important to note that our gross profit margin follows a fairly consistent annual pattern with generally the highest gross margins in the first quarter of each year. This is primarily driven by supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows early in the year, which is accounted for as a credit to cost of goods sold. So the sequential decline in our gross profit margin from 44.4% in the 2012 first quarter to 43.5% in the 2012 second quarter is normal and expected. Our company operating margin increased 80 basis points to 14%. This improvement was driven by solid sales growth, gross margin expansion and positive expense leverage. Operating expenses grew 11%, including $24 million in incremental growth-related spending in the quarter, and the operating expenses from the businesses in Europe and Brazil, which we acquired during the last 12 months. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics: First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June. Second, operating performance by segment. Third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2012 guidance. As mentioned earlier, company sales increased 12% for the quarter. Daily sales growth by month was as follows; 12% in April, 13% in May, and 12% in June. The 12% sales growth for the quarter included 5 percentage points from acquisitions and a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. As a point of reference, foreign exchange represented a 1 percentage point headwind in the 2012 first quarter. On an organic basis, sales for the quarter increased 9% including 6 percentage points from volume and 3 percentage points from price. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments; the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounts for 77% of total company revenue, increased 7% in the quarter, consisting of 4% volume growth and 3% from price. Despite the hot weather in late June, sales of seasonal products were not a factor in the quarter or the month of June. Daily sales in the United States increased 7% in April, 8% in May and 7% in June. Let’s review sales performance by customer and market in the United States. Our growth drivers, which include increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, enhancing our eCommerce capabilities, and increasing our inventory management solutions are enabling Grainger to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share. This is evident when you look at the variety of customer end markets we serve in the United States and performance for each. Heavy Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits; Light Manufacturing, Commercial, Retail, Reseller and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits; Government was up in the low-single digits; and Contractors declined in the low-single digits. Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency. The 14% local currency sales growth in the quarter consisted of 12% volume growth and 2 percentage points from price. From a customer standpoint, sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Commercial, Oil & Gas, Utilities and Contractor end markets. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales increased 13% in April, 14% in May and 14% in June. Let’s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 84%, which consisted of a 75-percentage-point contribution from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, 21 percentage points from volume, led by strong growth in Japan, partially offset by a 12-percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let’s now take a look at June. There were 21 selling days in June of 2012, one less than in 2011. Total company sales were up 12% on a daily basis in June of 2012 versus June of 2011. The daily sales growth in June included 5 precentage points from acquisitions and a 2 percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased 9% on a daily basis, consisting of 6% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price inflation. In the United States, June daily sales were up 7%. This growth consisted of 4 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price. We saw positive daily sales growth in all but one of our U.S. customer end markets as follows: Heavy and Light Manufacturing increased in the low-double digits; Government, Commercial, Reseller, Retail and Natural Resources increased in the mid-single digits; and Contractor was essentially flat. The mid-single digit sales growth to our Government customers is worth noting. As we shared with our May sales release, the fiscal year end for many state and local governments end in June. Thanks to our strong relationships with these government agencies, coupled with the value of the service we provide, we enjoyed a strong finish to the month. This level of growth to the Government was achieved despite a 25% decline in sales to the U.S. Postal Service, related to their aggressive restructuring program. Daily sales in Canada for June increased 8 % in U.S. dollars, up 14% in local currency. The 14% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 12 percentage points from volume and 2 percentage points from price. Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the Commercial, Oil & Gas, Utilities, and Contractor end markets. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 86% in June, consisting of 75 percentage points from acquisitions, 25 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a negative 14 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales in the month of July are off to a good start. Despite the challenges of having the Fourth of July on a Wednesday, daily sales growth to date is trending in line with the 12% growth in June. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Thanks Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let’s jump right into performance by reporting segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 15% versus the 2011 second quarter. And the U.S. operating margin increased 120 basis points to 17.8%. This impressive performance was driven by 7% sales growth, higher gross margins and positive expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 20 basis points driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer and product mix. Expense leverage in the United States was positive despite $24 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising. Let’s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 15% versus the prior year, up 20% in local currency. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins and positive expense leverage contributed to operating margins increasing 60 basis points to 12%. Gross margins increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by improved customer mix. Operating performance for our Other Businesses improved versus a year ago, the result of our focus on enhancing growth and operating performance. This group posted operating earnings of $11 million for the quarter versus $9 million a year ago. Strong operating performance in Japan and Mexico was responsible for this improvement. In addition, approximately $1 million in operating earnings from Fabory in the quarter were offset by losses from the acquired business in Brazil. Consistent with our expectations, investments in expanding the sales force and product offering are creating some near-term headwinds for our business in Brazil. Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.3 million in the 2012 second quarter versus $1.5 million in the 2011 second quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to interest on the debt of €120 million incurred in 2011 to finance a portion of the Fabory acquisition. The effective tax rate for the 2012 second quarter was 37.9% versus 38.3% in 2011, adjusted for the $0.12 per-share benefit noted earlier. The lower rate was primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate. Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $132 million versus $191 million in 2011. The year-over-year reduction in cash flow was driven by higher investments in receivables and inventory tied to sales growth along with a reduction in current liabilities tied to higher payments for income taxes. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with cash on hand, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $56 million versus $52 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $58 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of this year. In addition, we bought back 760,000 shares of stock and ended the quarter with about 6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $207 million to shareholders in the quarter. As reported in our 2012 second quarter earnings release, we reiterated our 2012 sales guidance of 12 to 14% and raised the low end of our 2012 earnings per-share guidance by $0.10. We now expect earnings per share of $10.50 to $10.80. Keep in mind, if economic growth slows and the dollar continues to strengthen, the lower end of our sales range is more probable than the higher end. If that happens, we plan to reassess and adjust spending levels. Let’s look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations. First, sales in the back half of the year are expected to grow in the 10 to 13% range. As a reminder, we reach the anniversary of the Fabory acquisition at the end of August. In addition, we will lose a selling day in the 2012 third quarter and gain it back in the fourth quarter versus 2011. Second, we continue to forecast operating margin expansion, over prior year, in the remaining quarters of 2012. Gross profit margins for the remaining quarters should remain relatively consistent with the 43.5% reported for the 2012 second quarter. Incremental growth related spending in the 2012 third quarter should be in line with the $24 million incremental spend in the 2012 second quarter. Better expense and earnings leverage should come in the 2012 fourth quarter as we lap some of the aggressive growth investments in 2011, such as new sales representatives and eCommerce, and benefit from having a full quarter of Fabory in the base. Although comparisons will be easier in the 2012 fourth quarter, we plan to continue to invest in our growth drivers given the opportunity to gain share in this large, fragmented market. Third, our Other Businesses have posted improved performance, which should continue to be driven by our business in Japan. As for our newest businesses, we continue to expect AnFreixo to be slightly dilutive in 2012, while Fabory may post a small loss if the economy and currency in Europe weaken further. Fourth, we now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind on both the top and bottom lines for the full year. Given the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange could represent as much as a 1 percentage point drag on sales and $0.04 to $0.06 per share in earnings dilution for the year. Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4 to 37.7%. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for the release of July sales on Friday, August 10th.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-09 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown – SVP, Communications and IR Bill Chapman – Senior Director, IR
Laura Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to share with you some information regarding Grainger’s first quarter 2012 results via this audio webcast. Please also reference our 2012 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 17, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Strong sales growth and consistent execution was the story for the quarter. This performance was largely driven by continued enhancements to the foundation of our business and aggressive investment in our growth programs. As a result of the strong start to 2012, we have increased and narrowed the ranges for our sales and EPS guidance as referenced in today’s earnings release. We now expect sales to grow 12% to 14% and are forecasting EPS of $10.40 to $10.80 for the full year 2012. At the end of this recording, we’ll talk more about our revised guidance and our assumptions. We’ll start with total company results, and then take a closer look at our segments. Company sales increased 16% versus the 2011 first quarter. We had 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings increased 16%, while net earnings increased 19%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.57 for the quarter is an all-time company record and represents an 18% increase versus 2011. In a few moments we’ll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter; let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 44.4%, as we successfully expanded gross margins across the business. Due to our size and scale, we were able to increase prices with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We’ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. It is important to note that our gross profit margin follows a fairly consistent annual pattern, with generally highest gross margins in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows in the quarter. Company operating margins were essentially flat with the prior year at 13.9%. This was a function of strong sales growth and gross margin expansion offset by higher operating expenses driven by Fabory’s incremental expenses, growth-related spending, and higher corporate expenses, including stock-based compensation and expenses related to M&A activity and other corporate support expenses. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of our revised 2012 guidance. As mentioned earlier, company sales increased 16% for the quarter. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 17% in January, 18% in February, and 15% in March. Of the 16% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 10 percentage points, acquisitions added 5 percentage points, and price added 3 percentage points. Foreign exchange and lower sales of seasonal products each represented a 1 percentage point drag on daily sales growth for the quarter. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which account for about 77% of total company revenue, increased 11% in the quarter, consisting of 9% volume growth and 3% from price, partially offset by a drag of 1 percentage point due to lower sales of seasonal products. By month, daily sales in the United States were up 11% in January, up 12% in February, and up 9% in March. Now we’ll cover sales performance by customer end-market in the United States. We believe that increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, and increasing our eCommerce capabilities is enabling the company to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share. As a result, sales to every customer end-market we serve in the United States, including Government, were positive in the quarter as follows. Natural Resources, formerly Agriculture and Mining, and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the mid-teens. Commercial, Retail, and Light Manufacturing were up in the low double-digits. Reseller was up in the high single-digits, and Government and Contractors were up in the mid-single-digits. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced the possible divestiture of our Specialty Brands. Since that time, we have not received an acceptable offer. We plan to continue to operate the businesses and evaluate future options. Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent about 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 19% in January, up 14% in February, and up 11% in March. The 14% local currency sales growth in the quarter consisted of 13% volume growth and 1 percentage point from price. From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by strength in the Construction, Agriculture and Mining, Transportation, Retail/Wholesale, and Heavy Manufacturing customer end-markets. Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 104%, the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico, coupled with the incremental sales from Fabory, our business in Europe acquired in August of 2011. Excluding Fabory, sales for our Other Businesses increased 33%. Beginning in the second quarter, our Other Businesses will include the results of our newly acquired business in Brazil. This business, formerly known as AnFreixo S.A., is a leading broad line distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies and had 2011 sales of approximately US$37 million. The acquisition provides us with a solid entry point for physical operations in Brazil, the largest MRO market in Latin America. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding sales performance in the month. Let’s now take a closer look at March. There were 22 selling days in March of 2012, one less than 2011. Total company sales were up 15% on a daily basis in March of 2012 versus March of 2011. The 15% growth consisted of 8% volume growth, 3 percentage points from price inflation, and 5 percentage points from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point drag from foreign exchange. In the United States, March daily sales were up 9%. This growth consisted of 6 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price. Sales trends in March are more representative of our expectation for revenue growth going forward. Conversely, sales growth in January and February was unusually strong due to the following factors: number one, customer pre-buying in advance of our February price increase, particularly in our lighting product line; number two, a higher advertising spend; and number three, easier comparisons in January and February versus March. Consistent with the quarter, we saw positive daily sales growth in March to each of our U.S. customer end-markets as follows: Natural Resources increased in the low 20s; Heavy Manufacturing and Commercial increased in the low double-digits; Light Manufacturing, Reseller, and Retail were up in the high single-digits; Government was up in the mid-single-digits; and Contractor was up in the low single-digits. Daily sales in Canada for March increased 10% in U.S. dollars, up 11% in local currency. The 11% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 11% volume and 1 percentage point from price, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline attributable to lower sales of seasonal products. Similar to the quarter, customers in the Construction, Agriculture and Mining, Transportation, Retail/Wholesale, and Heavy Manufacturing customer end-markets accounted for the largest increases in sales growth. The growth rate in March was influenced by difficult comparisons, particularly in the Government sector, where spending reached record levels in 2011. Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 110% in March, the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico along with sales for our business in Europe. Excluding Fabory, sales for the Other Businesses increased 38% in March. Sales growth in the month of April started a bit slowly, primarily due to the religious holidays, but is expected to be roughly in line with the growth in March. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Since we’ve already covered company operating performance, let’s jump right into performance by segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 17% versus the 2011 first quarter, and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 17.6%. This performance was driven by 11% sales growth, higher gross margins, and positive expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 10 basis points driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by higher freight costs and unfavorable mix, as lower sales of seasonal products slowed the sales growth of private label products. Expense leverage in the United States was positive despite higher growth-related spending on new sales representatives, eCommerce, and advertising. Let’s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 24% versus the prior year, 26% in local currency. Strong sales growth coupled with higher gross margins and effective cost management contributed to operating margins increasing 100 basis points to 10.9%. Gross margins increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by improved customer mix and higher prices. Operating performance for our Other Businesses improved versus a year ago, the result of our focus on improving growth and operating results. This group posted operating earnings of $11 million for the quarter versus $6 million a year ago. Strong operating performance in Japan and Mexico, coupled with $1 million in operating earnings from Fabory, drove the improved results for this group. Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.5 million in the 2012 first quarter versus $1.4 million in the 2011 first quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to interest on the debt of €120 million used to finance a portion of the Fabory acquisition. As mentioned at our November Analyst Meeting and in the 2011 Form 10-K, we were originally forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.9% for the full year 2012. In the 2012 first quarter, the effective tax rate was 37.4%, primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate. The difference between the actual effective tax rate and the forecasted rate resulted in a $0.02 per share benefit for the quarter. We are now expecting the full year 2012 effective tax rate to be in the range of 37.4% to 37.7%. Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $106 million versus $118 million in 2011. The year-over-year reduction in cash flow was driven by lower trade accounts payable balances, due to the timing of inventory purchases, and a higher contribution to the company’s retirement plan tied to strong company performance and higher payroll expense in the prior year. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return $109 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $41 million. We paid dividends of $47 million and bought back 291,000 shares of stock. As of quarter-end, the company has approximately 6.8 million shares remaining on its share repurchase authorization. As reported in our 2012 first quarter earnings release, we raised and narrowed both sales and earnings guidance for the full year 2012. We now expect sales growth in the range of 12% to 14% and earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.80. While our sales guidance is below our first quarter 2012 performance, we expect EPS to expand over the prior year at an increasing rate for the remainder of 2012. Let’s look more closely at the underlying elements of our revised expectations. First, sales growth in the first quarter, particularly January and February, was stronger than we had forecasted. Second, unlike the first quarter, we are forecasting operating margin expansion over prior-year in each remaining quarter of 2012. This expansion should come from a more even contribution from both gross margin expansion and better expense leverage. Gross profit margins in the second quarter should be higher than the prior year but below the 2012 first quarter, which includes supplier support provided for the annual customer trade shows. Year-over-year, gross profit margins for the remaining quarters should exceed 2011 but will remain relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2012. Again, better expense and earnings leverage should come in the back half of the year as we lap our growth investments, such as new sales representatives and eCommerce. Third, our international business have posted improved performance, which we expect to continue. We believe Fabory will continue to deliver $0.03 to $0.06 of earnings accretion in 2012, while our newly acquired business in Brazil should be $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive this year. Finally, the lower tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% forecasted for 2012 should contribute $0.04 to $0.09 per share for the full year. As noted earlier, the first quarter included about a $0.02 benefit from the lower tax rate versus our original forecast. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for our Shareholders’ Meeting on Wednesday, April 25, and the release of April sales on Friday, May 11.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-01-25 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown – Senior Vice President, Communications William D. Chapman – Investor Relations
Analysts:
Laura D. Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this audio webcast is to provide you with some additional color and perspective on Grainger’s Fourth Quarter 2011 Results. Please be sure to reference our earnings release issued January 25th in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this webcast. Before we go any further, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Strong sales growth across all businesses and acceleration in spending on our growth programs was the story for the quarter. Continued strong organic sales performance in the quarter with 9% volume growth is evidence that we continue to gain market share. For the 2011 fourth quarter, the company reported record sales of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14% versus $1.8 billion in the 2010 quarter. Net earnings of $148 million increased 12% and earnings per share of $2.04 increased 11% versus a $1.83 in 2010. In the earnings release and at the end of this podcast script, we provided a walk down of items to help explain results for the quarter and highlight what items were not reflected in our guidance. The 2011 fourth quarter included a $0.16 per share charge from the closure of 27 branches in the U.S. business and a $0.07 per share gain from the sale of our 49% ownership in a joint venture MRO Korea. These two items combined represented a $0.09 net reduction to earnings per share, resulting in adjusted EPS of $2.13. The 2010 fourth quarter included a $0.04 per share benefit from the change to the company’s paid time off policy. Excluding these items in both years, earnings per share increased 19% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the 2010 quarter. In a few moments we’ll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter. In the meantime, let’s walk down the income statement. Our gross profit margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points versus last year. The increase in the company’s gross profit margin was driven by a number of factors that are explained at the segment level. In addition, the inclusion of the Fabory business for the quarter contributed to gross margin expansion, but was a drag on the company’s operating margin. Company operating earnings of $221 million for the 2011 fourth quarter increased 5%. If you exclude the $18 million pre-tax expense from the branch closures in the 2011 quarter and the $4 million pre-tax benefit from the change in paid time off policy in the 2010 quarter, operating earnings were up 16% for the quarter. Adjusting for these items, company operating margin for the quarter increased by 20 basis points to 11.6% versus the prior-year, the strong margin expansion in the first three quarters of 2011 was tempered in the final quarter by $31 million in incremental growth-related spending. This included new sales representatives, eCommerce, advertising and expenses for our new 800,000 square foot distribution center in northern California. In addition, the Fabory business posted an operating loss for the quarter. Net earnings and earnings per share for the 2011 fourth quarter also included a benefit from a lower tax rate than in the 2010 fourth quarter. The effective tax rate was 32.9% and 36.6% in the 2011 and 2010 fourth quarters, respectively. The lower tax rate resulted primarily from a lower state tax expense, tax law changes in Japan enacted in late November of 2011, and higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The $31 million in incremental growth-related expenses contributed to this lower tax rate, as the spending was concentrated in the United States, which has Grainger’s largest and most profitable business, with one of the highest tax rates in the company. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of December, second, our operating performance by segment. Third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally we’ll wrap up with a discussion on our 2012 guidance and other key items of interest. As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter increased 14% versus the prior-year. There were 63 selling days in the quarter, the same as the 2010 fourth quarter. Strong volume growth was responsible for the majority of the revenue increase contributing 9 percentage points, followed by 5 percentage points from acquisitions, 2 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 2 percentage point drag from product sales related to the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Colombia, China, Puerto Rico, Panama and our newest location in the Dominican Republic, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States segment, which accounted for about 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 8%. The sales increase in the United States was driven primarily by 8% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price. This growth was partially offset by a 2 percentage points drag from oil spill-related sales in 2010 and a 1 percentage point headwind from lower sales of seasonal products due to the unusually warm weather in the 2011 quarter. All U.S end-markets, except reseller, posted growth versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Heavy manufacturing and commercial were up in the low double digits. Light manufacturing and retail were up in the high single digits. Government was up in the mid single digits. Contractor was up in the low single digits and reseller was down in the mid-teens due to the difficult comparison with strong oil spill related sales in the 2010 fourth quarter. Now let’s turn our attention to our Canadian business, which accounted for about 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 13% in U.S. dollars and were up 14% in local currency. Volume growth contributed 13 percentage points to the sales increase, while acquisitions completed during the last 12 months contributed 1 additional percentage point. This growth was partially offset by a 1 percentage point headwind from foreign exchange. The sales increase in Canada was led by strong growth to customers in the Construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Agriculture and Mining sectors of the economy. Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Colombia, China, Puerto Rico, Panama and the Dominican Republic and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group were up 95%, primarily the result of the incremental sales from Fabory, combined with strong revenue growth in Japan and Mexico. Excluding Fabory, sales for the Other Businesses increased 26% in the quarter. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding December sales performance during the month. Total company sales increased 10% in December 2011 versus December of 2010. Both months had 21 selling days. Contributing to higher daily sales growth in December were 9 percentage points due to volume, which is consistent with the quarter and ahead of the 8% volume growth for the full-year, 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 2 percentage points due to price. This sales growth was partially offset by a 3 percentage point drag related to the oil spill and a 2 percentage point headwind due to lower sales of seasonal products. In the United States, sales for the month of December increased 5%. This growth consisted of 8 percentage points of volume and 2 percentage points from price, offset by a 3 percentage point drag related to the oil spill and a 2 percentage point drag from lower sales of seasonal products. Here is how each of our U.S. customer end-markets performed in December. Heavy Manufacturing was up in the low double digits. Commercial and Retail were up in the high single digits. Light Manufacturing and Government were up in the mid single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits, and Reseller was down in the high twenties due to the difficult comparison with strong oil spill related sales in December of 2010. In Canada, sales in December increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. Volume accounted for about 12 percentage points of the growth, offset by 2 percentage points from foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from lower sales of seasonal products. From a customer end-market standpoint, we saw the strongest growth in sales to the Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Commercial Segments. With five selling days left in the month, daily sales growth in January is trending above December and slightly above the high-end of our 10% to 14% range for the full year. In the U.S. business, we’re seeing stronger growth among customers in the Heavy and Light Manufacturing end-markets, and a recovery in the Contractor market which was hurt by the warm weather in December. While sales growth from our new Territory Sales Representatives in tracking to plan, a disproportionate amount of our organic revenue growth is being driven by large contract customers with lower gross profit margins. Month-to-date sales results in Canada and Mexico are also running ahead of our daily sales growth in the 2011 fourth quarter. Consistent with December and the fourth quarter, a portion of the sales growth in January is attributable to the incremental sales from Fabory. Now I’d like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman:  Thanks, Laura. The story behind the company’s operating results in the quarter can best be told by reviewing segment performance. So, let’s begin with the United States. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 5% versus the 2010 fourth quarter up 15% excluding the charge related to the 2011 branch closures and the 2010 paid time off benefit. The growth and operating earnings was primarily driven by the 8% sales growth and improved gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 170 basis points driven primarily by price increases exceeding cost increases, positive selling mix from a decline in sales of lower margin sourced products primarily attributable to the oil spill in 2010, growth of our private label business, and lower excess and obsolete requirements. Operating expenses in the U.S. increased 15% on a reported basis, 10% excluding the two items just noted. The 10% increase in operating expenses was driven by higher volume related expenses and growth-related spending including new sales representatives, eCommerce, advertising and incremental expenses for the 800,000 square foot distribution center in Northern California. One of the growth programs that contributed to the operating expense growth in the quarter was our sales force expansion. We hired our 6th wave of Territory Sales Representatives or TSRs, and now have more than 500 of these new sales representatives calling on customers across the United States. As we shared at our Analyst Meeting in November, we’re very excited about the additional reach these sellers provide as they call on both existing and prospective customers. We estimate that TSRs will account for approximately 1 percentage point of our expected sales growth in 2012 and 2 percentage points in 2013. On average, a TSR cost approximately 40% less than an Account Manager and are generating sales with a gross profit margin north of 50%. As we build out our coverage, we expect to hire another 300 TSRs in 2012. Another growth program we’re aggressively funding is eCommerce. In 2011, we transacted approximately $2 billion in sales through eCommerce, representing about 25% of total company sales. We’re also in the midst of transitioning to a new U.S. platform that should allow for more functionality, speed and personalization. Most recently, we officially launched our new mobile site that interacts seamlessly with Grainger.com. It enables users with smart phones to search for products, create personal lists, view real-time inventory availability, approve and place orders. Customers can then choose to have those products shift from a distribution center or picked up at a local branch through the branch locator tool. Our mobile platform fully leverages our multi-channel business model. Let’s now look at the strong operating performance of our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 121% in U.S dollars and 123% in local currency. Gross profit margins in Canada increased 250 basis points, due primarily to effective price cost management, and growth of our private label business. Operating expenses in Canada increased 1%, primarily the result of effective cost management and easy comparisons with the 2010 quarter that included start-up related costs for the new distribution center in British Columbia. Operating earnings at our other businesses, which again includes our operations in Europe, Latin America and Asia were flat versus the 2010 fourth quarter at $5 million. Lead by Japan, Mexico and Columbia, earnings improved over the prior-year fourth quarter in virtually all countries with the exception of recent startups and Fabory, our business in Europe acquired on August 31, 2011. Excluding Fabory, operating earnings for this group were $6 million in the quarter. From an EPS perspective, Fabory generated $0.04 per share of dilution for the company in the quarter and $0.02 per share of dilution for the four months, since the acquisition. As a reminder, we originally expected Fabory to be earnings neutral for 2011, but performance was not as strong as expected due to softer sales and customer mix, primarily due to the economic climate in Europe. Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $164 million versus $104 million in 2010. We used the cash generated to invest in the business and pay $48 million in dividends, which reflects the 22% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced last April or $0.66 per share. We also bought back 284,000 shares of stock for $50 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million, which was primarily invested in expanding the capacity of our distribution center network in the United States. Now, let’s take a look at the full-year. Operating cash flow was $724 million in 2011 versus $596 million in 2010. Capital expenditures for the year were $197 million and $128 million in 2010. Most of the year-over-year increase in capital spending was attributable to investments in our distribution network. In addition, we funded a portion of the Fabory acquisition with cash and paid down debt. We bought back 1 million shares of stock during 2011 for $151 million and have approximately 7.1 million shares remaining on the current authorization. In addition, we paid shareholders $181 million of dividends in 2011. So, for the full-year, we returned a total of $332 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At our Annual Analyst Meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2012, and we reiterated that guidance today. We continue to expect 2012 sales to grow in the range of 10% to 14%, and 2012 EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10.65. We also expect operating margin expansion of 20 to 50 basis points including Fabory and 50 to 80 basis points on an organic basis. Here are a few additional considerations as you refine your models. Organic sales growth in the 2012 first quarter is off to a strong start, benefiting from a number of new large customer contracts that began with initial lift in early January. Keep in mind that a healthy portion of our top-line growth is also coming from emerging markets including acquisitions like Fabory, which should continue to contribute about 4 to 5 percentage points of our growth in the first eight months of the year, albeit at lower operating margins. We’ll have 64 selling days in the first quarter, which is the same number as the 2011 first quarter. Gross profit margins in the 2012 first quarter should expand versus the 2011 fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2011. But we’ll be tempered by faster organic growth from larger contract customers with lower gross profit margins. Organic growth investments are expected to ramp up throughout the 2012 first quarter similar to the 2011 fourth quarter. As we move through the year, difficult prior-year operating expense comparisons will ease, particularly, as we anniversary the opening of the Northern California distribution center and the Fabory acquisition in the third quarter, which should then allow for better earnings leverage. We expect the effective tax rate for 2012 to be 37.9%. And as a result, we expect 2012 first quarter earnings per share to grow inline with sales growth with improved earnings leverage later in the year. Finally, we remain committed to delivering top quartile total shareholder return, which is forecasted at 18% to 19% in 2012, as detailed on Exhibit 04. Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

===== 2011 Q3  (2011-10-19 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown – Senior Vice President, Communications William D. Chapman – Investor Relations 
Laura D. Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to share with you an update regarding Grainger’s Third Quarter 2011 Results via this audio webcast. Please also reference our 2011 third quarter earnings release issued October 18th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this webcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. We are excited to report that Grainger delivered another record quarter. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion was the story for the quarter. Thanks to the success of our growth drivers, we continued to gain market share during the quarter just as we did throughout the downturn. Our growth drivers include expanding our product line, increasing our sales force, enhancing our eCommerce capabilities, growing our inventory management services and investing in our international operations. One of the highlights of the quarter was the acquisition of the Fabory Group. Fabory is a leading European distributor of fasteners and related MRO products. The closing of the acquisition took place on August 31st. We are also very pleased to announce that we have raised our guidance for the year. As noted in the release, we are now expecting sales for 2011 to grow 11% to 12%, with earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.00, excluding unusual items. Please note that our guidance reflects higher growth-related spending for the remainder of the year, which we will discuss later in this podcast. Let’s start with total company results, then dig deeper into our segments. Company sales increased 11% versus the 2010 third quarter. We had the same number of selling days this quarter as 2010, so reported sales growth and daily sales growth were the same. Operating earnings and net earnings increased 21%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.51 is an all-time record and represents a 22% increase versus 2010. As a reminder, the 2010 third quarter included a $0.07 per share benefit from the change in the Company’s paid time off, or PTO policy. Excluding the PTO benefit in 2010, third quarter earnings per share increased 26%. In a few moments, we’ll take an in-depth look at sales results for the quarter. Let’s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased to 43.2%, up 160 basis points versus last year, with higher gross margins in the United States, Canada and in our Other Businesses. Again this quarter, we were able to manage product cost inflation below price increases. We’ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. Reported company operating earnings for the quarter increased 21%. Company operating margins were 14.3%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. If you exclude the $8 million benefit in 2010 from the PTO change, operating earnings were up 25% and operating margins increased 150 basis points. This strong performance was primarily driven by the 11% sales growth and the 160 basis point improvement in gross profit margins. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, our operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion of other key items of interest. As mentioned earlier, sales for the Company increased 11% for the quarter. Of the 11% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 8 percentage points, price added 3 percentage points, acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points, and foreign exchange added 1 percentage point. Sales related to last year’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico represented a headwind of 3 percentage points. Daily sales growth by month was as follows, 10% in July, 10% in August, and 14% in September. Excluding Fabory, daily sales in September increased 10%. It is important to note that despite the uncertainty in the economy, we saw consistent, 10% sales growth throughout the quarter. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, Fabory in Europe, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, India, China, Puerto Rico and Panama are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 81% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%. By month, daily sales in the United States increased 5% in July, 8% in August and 7% in September.  The 7% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 7% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 3 percentage point drag from the oil spill-related sales in 2010. In August, we put through a modest price increase in the U.S. business tied to commodity inflation. Now we’ll cover our sales performance by customer end-market in the United States. Domestic growth initiatives, including product line expansion, sales force expansion, eCommerce and inventory management services are driving the company to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share. As a result, sales to all customer end-markets in the United States, except for reseller, were positive in the quarter as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid teens; commercial was up in the low double-digits; light manufacturing and retail were up in the high single-digits; contractors and government were up in the mid single-digits; and reseller was down in the low 20s, reflecting the strong sales of oil spill-related products in 2010. Let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business, which represented 12% of total company revenues in the 2011 third quarter. Sales in Canada increased 23% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 18% in July, up 14% in August and up 15% in September. The 16% sales growth in the quarter consisted of 14% volume growth and 2 percentage points from acquisitions. From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by strength in the heavy manufacturing, retail/wholesale, transportation, and agriculture and mining customer end-markets. Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which accounted for 7% of total company sales in the quarter. Again, this group includes our operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, India, China, Puerto Rico and Panama. Sales for this group increased 66%, primarily from the incremental sales from Fabory in the month of September, along with strong growth in Japan and Mexico. All businesses contributed to the strong sales growth in the quarter. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August. Let’s now take a closer look at September. There were 21 selling days in September of 2011 and 2010. Total company sales increased 14% in September, versus September of 2010, consisting of 8% volume growth, 5 percentage points from acquisitions, 3 percentage points from price inflation and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 3 percentage point headwind from oil spill-related sales in 2010. Excluding sales from Fabory, daily sales in September increased 10%. In the United States, September sales increased 7%. This growth consisted of 7 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price, partially offset by 3 percentage points from sales related to last year’s oil spill. Daily sales growth in September to each of our U.S. customer end-markets was as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid teens; commercial and light manufacturing was up in the low double-digits; retail was up in the high single-digits; contractors was up in the mid single-digits; government was up in the low single-digits; and reseller was down in the high teens reflecting the strong sales of oil spill-related products in 2010. Sales in Canada for September increased 19% in U.S. dollars, up 15% in local currency. The 15% sales growth consisted of 13% volume, 1% price and 1% from acquisitions. Customers in the heavy manufacturing, retail/wholesale, transportation, and agriculture and mining end markets accounted for the largest percentage increases in September. Sales for our Other Businesses increased 117% in September, primarily the result of incremental sales from Fabory, along with strong sales growth in Japan. Company sales growth so far in the month of October is tracking roughly in line with the growth rate posted in September. As a reminder, sales related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill clean up contributed 1 percentage point to the 11% daily growth in October of last year. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman:  Thanks Laura. Let’s jump right into performance by segment since we have already covered company operating performance. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 15% versus the 2010 third quarter and operating margin increased 130 basis points to 17.7%. If you exclude the benefit from the PTO change in 2010, operating earnings in the United States increased 19% and operating margins expanded 180 basis points versus the prior year. This performance was driven by 7% sales growth and a higher gross profit margin. Gross profit margins in the United States increased 180 basis points. The gross margin expansion was primarily due to managing product cost inflation below price increases, coupled with favorable selling price mix, strong sales of private label products and lower sales of sourced products related to the clean up of the 2010 oil spill. Operating expenses increased 9%, 7% excluding the PTO benefit from the prior year. The growth in operating expenses was driven by volume related costs and spending on growth initiatives such as sales force expansion, eCommerce, advertising and the start up of the new distribution center in northern California. Our business in Canada delivered improved performance in the quarter, a continuation of the strong results seen in the first half of 2011. Third quarter operating earnings increased 72% versus the prior year. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross margins and effective cost management contributed to a 290 basis point increase in operating margins to 10.1%. The gross margin expansion in Canada was driven by the same factors as seen in the United States. Operating expenses increased 12%, aided by improved productivity and lower utility costs resulting from milder weather. For the fourth quarter, start up costs for the new distribution center in Saskatchewan will result in sequential operating expense growth. Despite these investments, we expect to generate about 150 to 200 basis points of year-over-year operating expense leverage in the 2011 fourth quarter in Canada. Operating earnings for our Other Businesses increased 139% to $11 million versus $4 million a year ago. This increase was the result of improved operating performance in Japan, Mexico and China. Fabory’s September results also contributed to higher operating earnings for the Other Businesses in the quarter. At a total company level, Fabory’s earnings were essentially offset by acquisition costs, which are included in unallocated expenses. Interest expense, net of interest income, was $2 million versus $1.6 million in the prior year. The increase was due to the €120 million in new debt to finance half of the Fabory acquisition. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7% versus 39.4%. The lower rate is primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Lastly, let’s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $251 million, a 22% increase versus $206 million in 2010. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $47 million versus $43 million in the prior year quarter. Dividends paid to shareholders were $47 million. We also bought back 360,000 shares of stock during the quarter and have approximately 7.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. As reported in today’s release, we increased our 2011 sales and earnings guidance, reflecting our strong performance to date and the addition of Fabory beginning in September. We now expect 2011 sales growth in the range of 11% to 12% and earnings per share in the range of $8.80 to $9.00. Keep in mind, our EPS guidance excludes unusual items such as the $0.12 per share benefit recognized in the 2011 second quarter from the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008 and the expected $5 million after-tax gain on the sale of our minority ownership position in MRO Korea, announced on October 11, 2011. So, let’s look at the underlying elements of our expectations. First, incremental sales from Fabory, beginning in September, add about 2 percentage points to our expected top-line growth for the year. This is the primary driver of our revised guidance of 11% to 12% sales growth, versus our previous sales guidance of 9% to 10% growth issued on July 19, 2011.
fourth: We had expected some of the new sales representatives to be hired in the third quarter, but those incremental expenses will now begin in the fourth quarter. We’ll also be investing in some information technology infrastructure to support the development and phased roll out of the Company’s new eCommerce platform. Our national advertising campaign will also continue in the fourth quarter. Finally, the ramp up of our new 800,000 square foot super regional distribution center in northern California will result in additional operating expense in the 2011 fourth quarter. To recap, we still expect $60 million to $70 million in growth-related spending in 2011 spread as follows; $8 million in the first quarter, $11 million in the second quarter, $20 million in the third quarter, and $19 million to $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. To summarize, 2011 is turning out to be an exceptional year for Grainger. For the first three quarters, we have generated 230 basis points of operating margin expansion, excluding unusual items, on 12% sales growth. For the full year, we expect normalized operating margins to be 170 to 180 basis points higher than 2010, which is essentially three years worth of normal annual margin expansion. Keep in mind however, that the 2011 fourth quarter will have lower operating margins than the first three quarters due to the following factors. Organic sales growth is typically lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter; the 2011 fourth quarter will have one less selling day than the 2011 third quarter, 63 versus 64; as noted earlier, we expect to see even more growth-related investment spending in the fourth quarter; and finally, we will have a full quarter of results from Fabory, which is expected to carry mid single-digit operating margins and be earnings neutral for 2011. Please mark your calendar for the release of October sales on Friday, November 11th and our Analyst Meeting on November 16th. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at 847-535-0409 or me at 847-535-0881. Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-07-19 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown, Senior VP, Communications and Investor Relations Bill Chapman, Director, Investor Relations 
Laura Brown - Senior VP, Communications and Investor Relations: Hello, this is Laura Brown, senior vice president of communications and investor relations. With me is Bill Chapman, director of investor relations. We are pleased to share with you an update regarding Grainger's second quarter 2011 results via this audio webcast. Please also reference our 2011 second quarter earnings release issued July 19 in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward looking statements.  Strong sales growth, consistent execution, and impressive gross margin expansion was the story for the quarter. We are very pleased with our continued ability to gain share due to expanding our product line, our sales force, ecommerce capabilities, onsite services, and our international operations.  As a result of the strong year-to-date performance, we have raised our full year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect sales to grow 9% to 10% and are forecasting EPS in the range of $8.40 to $8.70 for the full year 2011, excluding unusual items.  Please note that our guidance reflects tougher comparisons on the top line, continued strong gross profit margins, and higher growth-related spending in the back half of the year. At the end of this recording, we'll talk in more detail about our revised guidance and our assumptions.    We'll start with total company results, then dig deeper into our segments. Company sales increased 12% versus the 2010 second quarter. We had the same number of selling days this quarter as 2010, so reported sales growth and daily sales growth were the same. Operating earnings increased 23% while net earnings increased 32%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.34 for the quarter is an all-time company record and represents a 35% increase versus 2010.  There was an unusual item in both the 2011 and the 2010 second quarters. The 2011 quarter included a $0.12 per share benefit, primarily from the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008. As mentioned previously, please note that this $0.12 per share tax benefit is not included in our guidance.  The 2010 second quarter included an $0.08 per share benefit from the change in the company's paid time off, or PTO, policy. Additional details can be found in the second quarter earnings releases for 2011 and 2010. In a few moments, we'll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement.  Gross profit margins increased to 43.1%, up 120 basis points versus last year, as we were successful expanding gross margins in the United States, Canada, and our other businesses. Our size and scale gives us considerable advantage versus other distributors when it comes to effectively managing product cost inflation. Once again, this quarter, we were able to increase prices in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We'll provide more detail when we review the business by segment. Gross profit margins generally follow a fairly consistent seasonal pattern with lower gross margins in the second and third quarters than in the first quarter. As a reminder, supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows was a major contributor to the 44% gross margin reported in the 2011 first quarter.  Reported company operating earnings for the quarter increased 23%, while operating margins were 13.2%, up 120 basis points versus the prior year. If you exclude the $10 million benefit in 2010 from the PTO change, operating earnings were up 30% and operating margins were up 180 basis points. This strong performance was driven by the 12% sales growth, the 120 basis point improvement in gross profit margins, and positive expense leverage, excluding the PTO benefit. Strong execution across the board in the United States, Canada, and the other businesses contributed to this impressive performance.  Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June. Second, our operating performance by segment. Third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our revised 2011 guidance and other key items of interest.  As mentioned earlier, sales for the company increased 12% for the quarter. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 14% in April, 11% in May, and 12% in June. Of the 12% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 8% and price added another 2%, while acquisitions added 1%. The difficult comparison from last year's oil spill-related sales represented a drag of 1%. Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: The United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, Columbia, and Panama are reported under a group titled other businesses. Sales in the United States, which account for about 81% of total company revenue, increased 9% in the quarter.  By month, daily sales in the United States were up 10% in April, 8% in May, and 8% in June. The 9% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 7% volume growth and 3% from price, partially offset by a 1% drag from the oil spill. In May, we put through a modest price increase in the United States business tied to commodity inflation.  Now we'll cover our sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Domestic growth initiatives including product line expansion, sales force expansion, ecommerce, and MRO-related services such as KeepStock, are helping the company grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share. As a result, sales to all customer end markets we serve in the United States were positive in the quarter as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid-teens, light manufacturing and commercial were up in the high single digits, contractors and retail were up in the mid-single digits, and government and reseller were up in the low single digits. Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent about 13% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 16% in April, up 15% in May, and up 17% in June. The 16% sales growth in the quarter consisted of 12% volume growth, 3% from acquisitions, and 1% from price.  From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by impressive strength in the oil and gas, heavy manufacturing, agriculture and mining, and retail wholesale customer end markets.  Let's conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the other businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, Columbia, and Panama, and currently represents about 6% of total company sales.  Sales for this group increased 49%, primarily the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico and sales reported from the business we acquired in Colombia. Sales for our business in Japan benefitted early in the quarter from sales of emergency supplies following the earthquake and tsunami. Although smaller in size, the remaining businesses within this group also delivered strong sales growth in the quarter.  Early in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding in the month. Let's now take a closer look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2011 and 2010. Total company sales were up 12% in June versus June of 2010.  The 12% growth consisted of 8% volume growth, 2% each from price inflation and foreign exchange, and 1% from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% drag from the oil spill related sales in 2010. In the United States, June sales were up 8%. This growth consisted of 6% of volume along with 3% from price, partially offset by 1% from sales related to last year's oil spill.  Daily sales growth in June to each of our U.S. customer end markets was as follows. Heavy manufacturing was up in the mid-teens, light manufacturing and commercial were up in the high single-digits, contractors and retailers were up in the mid-single digits. Government was flat, and reseller was down high single-digits, reflecting the strong sales of oil spill-related products in 2010. Sales in Canada for June increased 25% in U.S. dollars, up 17% in local currency. The 17% sales growth consisted of 14% volume and 3% from acquisitions. Customers in the agriculture and mining, retail wholesale, oil and gas, and heavy manufacturing end markets accounted for the largest increase in sales growth in June.  Sales for our other businesses increased 60% in June, primarily the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico along with sales for our business in Columbia. Consistent with the quarter, the remaining businesses within this group also delivered strong sales growth in June. As a reminder, starting in July, we passed the anniversary of the Columbian acquisition.  Sales growth so far in the month of July is tracking roughly in line with the growth rate posted in June, excluding the headwind from oil spill-related sales. As a reminder, sales related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill cleanup contributed 3% to the 21% daily growth in July of last year. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman - Director, Investor Relations : Thanks Laura. Since we have already covered company opening performance, let's jump right into performance by segment. Reported operating earnings in the United States increased 17% in the 2010 second quarter and operating margins increased 120 basis points to 16.6%. If you exclude the benefit from the PTO change in 2010, operating earnings in the United States increased 22% and operating margins expanded 180 basis points versus the prior year. This performance was driven by 9% sales growth and a higher gross profit margin. Gross profit margins in the United States increased 120 basis points.  The gross margin expansion was primarily due to an effective product cost management and the ability to raise prices with the market and ahead of product cost increases. Operating expenses grew in line with sales for the quarter and were up 6% excluding the PTO benefit from the prior year. Let's move on to our business in Canada. At the end of the 2010 fourth quarter, we shared with you the plan for improving performance. We're happy to report that we continued to make substantial progress in the 2011 second quarter as operating earnings increased 130% versus the prior year. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins and tight cost controls contributed to operating margins jumping 530 basis points to 11.4%.  The gross margin expansion in Canada was driven by a number of factors, including product cost deflation tied to the tailwind created by the strength of the Canadian dollar. A first quarter price increase, less price discounting and a more favorable customer mix also contributed to the growth in gross profit margins in the second quarter. Having reached the anniversary of actions taken last year to improve gross margins, we are expecting roughly 25 to 50 basis points of year over year in the back half of the year.  In the second half of 2011, we will be filling a number of of open volume-related positions and will be opening a new distribution center in Saskatchewan. As a result, we expect to generate about 150 to 200 basis points of year over year operating expense leverage in the back half of the year in Canada.  Operating performance in the quarter for our other businesses was impressive, the direct result of our focus on driving growth and improving profitability. This group posted operating earnings of $8.6 million for the quarter versus $1.9 million a year ago. Strong operating performance in Japan and Mexico led the improved results for this group. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.0% versus 39.1% in 2010, mainly due to the 12% per share benefit primarily related to the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate is now expected to be 38.7% for the full year due to higher earnings forecasted in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a slightly lower overall effective state income tax rate. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $190 million versus $173 million in 2010. The growth in accounts receivable resulted in a slight drag on cash flow for the quarter. This increase was greater than the growth in sales due to a postal strike in Canada and the timing of quarter end, both temporarily influencing the timeliness of cash processing. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders through dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $52 million. Dividends paid to shareholders were $47 million, representing the 22% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced in April. The company did not buy back any stock during the quarter, and has approximately 7.7 shares remaining on its share repurchase authorization. As reported in our second quarter earnings release, we raised both sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year 2011. We expect sales growth in the range of 9-10% and earnings per share in the range of $8.40 to $8.70. Company guidance does not include the $0.12 per share benefit, primarily from the settlement of tax examinations for 2007 and 2008. So let's take a look at the underlying elements of our expectations. First, as we have consistently communicated sales comparisons in the back half of the year are more difficult, in part due to sales related to the oil spill cleanup in 2010. Oil spill related sales added 3% to the 19% daily sales growth in the 2010 third quarter 2010 and 2% to the 14% daily sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2010. Additional detail can be found on the exhibits at the end of this podcast script.  Second, we expect gross profit margins in the third and fourth quarters to be similar to the 2011 second quarter, with some slight price erosion as the year goes on, which is typical. As a reminder, supplier funding for our customer trade shows in March made the 44% gross profit margin it 2011 first quarter different for the rest of the year. Third, our investments in proven growth drivers, such as new sales representatives, ecommerce, and advertising will continue to accelerate throughout the year. In fact, we expect to add more than double the number of new sales representatives in 2011 than originally planned, going from 150 to 300 new hires. We're also stepping up the pace of our ecommerce and advertising investments. The opening of our new 800,000-square foot superregional distribution center in Northern California in the 2011 fourth quarter will also result in additional operating expense. For the full year about $60-70 million in growth related spending should spread as follows: $8 million in the first quarter, $11 million in Q2, and $40-50 million in the second half of 2011.  Finally, the lower effective tax rate of 38.7% projected for the year 2011, excluding the $0.12 per share benefit in the 2011 second quarter, should offset a higher average share count than we had originally forecasted since we're currently building excess cash in anticipation of potential M&A activity. To summarize, our EPS guidance implies roughly 140-170 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year versus the 11.5% in 2010, adjusted for the PTO benefit, which is even stronger earnings growth than we had forecasted in Apr. We are very excited about our record results in the quarter and the opportunities going forward to gain share in this large and consolidating market. Never before have businesses and institutions been so focused on driving productivity and cost savings, and we look forward to helping our customers with these initiatives given our broad array of MRO products and services.  Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for the release of July sales on Wednesday, August 10. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at 847-535-0409, or me at 847-535-0881. Thank you.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-01-26 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Ernest Duplessis -- VP, IR Bill Chapman -- Director, IR
Ernest Duplessis: Hello, this is Ernest Duplessis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me is Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to be sharing with you today Grainger’s fourth quarter and full-year 2009 results via this audio webcast. This recording is intended to provide you with more information related to our recent performance. Please also reference our 2009 fourth quarter and full-year earnings release issued January 26, in addition to other information on our Investor Relations web site to supplement this webcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Let’s begin by summarizing our full-year 2009 results. Sales of $6.2 billion were down 9% versus 2008. Net earnings decreased 9% and earnings per share decreased 6% to $5.62 versus $5.97 in 2008. Over the next 25 minutes, we want to explain in more detail how we achieved these results and give you some idea of what we’re seeing and expecting for 2010. Taking a closer look at the income statement for the year, gross profit margins increased about 80 basis points to 41.8%. Operating margins decreased approximately 70 basis points to 10.7%. The decrease in operating margins for the year were mainly driven by the 9% sales decline for the year and operating expenses, which declined at a slower rate than sales. For comparability, it is important to note that our earnings per share of $5.62 for the year 2009 included a non-cash gain of $0.37 in the third quarter from the step-up of our investment in our Japanese business, MonotaRO. If you exclude this one-time gain of $0.37, EPS for 2009 was $5.25. As mentioned in our earnings release, there were also some severance and impairment charges taken throughout the year. As we continue to examine ways to improve our cost structure and address underperforming assets, you may see charges like these continue in 2010. Let’s now focus on our 2009 fourth quarter results. Sales of $1.6 billion were up 3% versus last year’s fourth quarter. In a few moments, we will address some of the factors that contributed to our sales performance. Operating earnings, however, decreased 8% and net earnings decreased 10%. Bill will discuss some of the factors in the operating earnings performance shortly. Let’s take a look at what went into earnings per share for the quarter. Overall, EPS decreased by 7% to $1.27. This was impacted by a couple of significant items. First, during the quarter, the company closed 12 branches which, along with other asset write-downs, resulted in the company recognizing asset impairment charges of $9 million or $0.07 a share. Second, the company reduced headcount by more than 200 positions in the fourth quarter, incurring a $7.5 million or $0.05 per share charge for severance. Fourth quarter EPS were $1.39 excluding these items, versus $1.37 in the prior year. Let’s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following topics: First, sales by segment in the quarter and in the month of December, including an update on our U.S. Product Line Expansion Program. Second, our operating performance by segment. Third, our cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion on our 2010 guidance and other key items of interest. As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter were up 3% versus the prior year. There were 64 days in both the 2009 and 2008 fourth quarters. Daily sales decreased 3% in October, then increased 2% in November and increased 11% in December. The 3% increase for the quarter included a 4 percentage point contribution from acquisitions, a 2 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange and a 2 percentage point lift from price increases, partially offset by a 5 percentage point decline in volume. Let’s move on to sales by segment. We now report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Japan, Mexico, India, China, and Panama are now reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. As a result of obtaining a controlling interest in the Japanese business in September 2009, beginning with the 2009 fourth quarter, we also began reporting 100% of the sales of our subsidiary in Japan as part of Other Businesses. However, it adds only a small increment of its profits to earnings since we had already been reporting our previous share of the profits in equity income. Sales in the United States, which represents 84% of total company sales, decreased 2% in the 2009 fourth quarter. By month, sales were down 7% in October, down 3% in November and up 5% in December. We are beginning to see small signs of improvement in the overall U.S. economy, although our optimism is tempered by the outlook for unemployment and economic uncertainty in the back half of the year. Here is what we saw in the quarter, specifically by customer end-market: Government and Commercial sales were up in the low single digits. Light manufacturing was essentially flat. Retail was down in the mid single digits. Heavy manufacturing was down in the low double digits. Contractor was down in the low teens. And reseller was down in the high teens. Also contributing to sales as well as operating earnings in the U.S. segment in the quarter was the benefit of the ongoing work to integrate Lab Safety Supply with Grainger Industrial Supply. We stated last year that we expected this combination to deliver $70 million to $100 million in incremental revenue and $20 million to $30 million in cost savings by the middle of this year. Through the end of the fourth quarter, the integration has generated $44 million of additional revenue and $22 million of cost savings and remains on track to achieve our stated sales goal, having already reached the range for cost savings. Part of our integration effort is the establishment of a common distribution platform for all the brands in the U.S. business. We should complete that by the end of the first quarter of 2010. Now let’s talk about our U.S. Product Line Expansion. Over the course of 2009, we have continued to add products to our already broad offering that will result in having approximately 307,000 in-stock products in the 2010 catalog. This represents a company record of 74,000 net new products added to the catalog since last year. Products added over the last four years have cumulatively resulted in $934 million in sales in 2009, with $260 million of that coming in the fourth quarter alone. This continues to be an area which allows us to pick up market share, and we expect several more years of sizable additions to our already broad product line. Now let’s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represents about 11% of total company sales. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 11% in U.S. dollars but were down 3% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter last year. On a daily basis in local currency, sales were down 7% in October, down 8% in November and up 7% in December. The Canadian economy is also starting to show signs of a recovery, but with unemployment still at high levels, just as we find in the United States. For the quarter, we saw strength in the agriculture/mining, government and utilities sectors, while weakness prevailed in the construction/contractors, heavy manufacturing and forestry sectors. The business also saw improvement in sales resulting from several large contracts at the end of the quarter. Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. This group now includes Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China and Panama and represents about 5% of total company sales. Sales from this group were up 214%, primarily the result of incremental sales from the businesses in Japan and India, with Mexico and China making positive contributions as well. For the month of December, total company sales were up 11% on a daily basis. There were 22 selling days in both December of 2009 and 2008. Contributing to the higher sales in December were 2 percentage points due to favorable exchange rates and 5 percentage points from acquisitions. The sales of seasonal products were not a factor in the month. However, we estimated that the timing of the Christmas holiday in 2009 provided 1 percentage point of favorability. Because Christmas 2008 fell on a Thursday, sales on that Friday were significantly lower. In 2009, Christmas was on a Friday. So, the combined effects of foreign exchange, acquisitions and holiday timing were 8 to 9 percentage points of growth, leaving organic growth at 2% to 3%, which is at the lower end of the new organic sales growth guidance of 2% to 5%. In the United States, December sales were up 5%. The combined effects of acquisitions and the timing of the Christmas holiday contributed 3 percentage points to the growth for the month. Here is how each of the U.S. customer end-markets performed in the month: Government, Light Manufacturing and Commercial were all up in the mid single digits. Retail was essentially flat. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the mid-single digits. Reseller was down in the high single digits. Remember that comparisons in the month were easier since December sales in 2008 were down 5%. Sales in Canada in December were up 26% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. As noted in the earnings release, sales in December benefited from some large customer orders and incremental sales from the acquisition of the assets of K&D Pratt Industrial Division, made in November of 2009. For the month, we saw the most strength in the government, agriculture/mining and utilities sectors, while the wholesale and heavy manufacturing segments showed the greatest weakness. Daily sales growth in the month of January is similar to what we saw in December. However, keep in mind that there are two factors contributing significantly to this trend. We expect the combined effects of the favorable timing of the New Year’s Day holiday in 2010 and the stretch of extremely cold weather at the beginning of the month provided about 2 percentage points of benefit. January organic sales are running 2% to 3%, similar to December, excluding acquisitions, foreign exchange and the timing of the January 1st holiday. As a reminder, January sales in 2009 were down 9%, so the company has easier comparisons. Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Thanks, Ernest. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the company decreased by 8% versus the 2008 fourth quarter. This decline was the result of an 80 basis point decrease in gross margins, primarily due to unfavorable mix of lower gross margins from the newly consolidated businesses in Japan and India. Operating expenses increased by 4% for the quarter. This was driven by a number of factors including $9 million in asset write-downs and $7.5 million in severance charges mentioned earlier. Company operating margin was 10.1%. Let’s now take a look at operating performance by segment. Operating earnings in the United States were down by 6% versus the 2008 fourth quarter. Operating margins declined by 60 basis points to 13.1%. Gross profit margins remained unchanged at 42.7%. In Canada, operating earnings were up 59% versus the 2008 fourth quarter. The improvement was the result of increased sales, a 90 basis point improvement in gross profit margins, and operating expenses which increased at a slower rate than sales. The improvement in gross margins was attributable to favorable inventory adjustments. The 2008 fourth quarter included a $2 million charge for the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services. Excluding these items, operating earnings were up 6% in U.S. dollars versus 2008. Operating losses for other business were $3 million in both 2009 and 2008 quarters. India, Panama and China were primary drivers of the losses, with Japan reporting net income. Lastly, let’s take a look at our operating cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $223 million versus $195 million in 2008. The full-year 2009 operating cash flow was $732 million, the strongest in company history. Cash allocated to capital expenditures was $53 million in the quarter and $142 million for the year. For the full year, the company returned $507 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The company bought back 2.5 million shares in the fourth quarter and 4.5 million shares for the year. As reported in our fourth quarter 2009 earnings release, we raised both sales and earnings guidance for 2010. We now expect sales growth in the range of 6% to 10% and EPS in the range of $5.40 to $5.90. Keep in mind that we expect about 3 percentage points of the top line growth to come from acquisitions and that the earnings drop-through in the initial year is less than company average. I won’t repeat what we said at the Analyst Meeting here, but 2010 is a transition year as we move from being a minority owner to a majority owner of the business in Japan. Also, let me emphasize that we now expect 100 to 200 basis points of top line growth coming from foreign exchange. The earnings drop-through for foreign exchange is about $0.01 to $0.02 of earnings per share, which is lower than what you would expect from a 1% to 2% increase in organic sales. The question you may be asking is, “so what has changed since mid-November when Grainger initially unveiled guidance for 2010?” First, we finished the year stronger than originally expected. Sales for the quarter were up 3%, versus our forecast of down 2% to up 1%. About 1 to 2 percentage points of that outperformance came from a larger contribution from foreign exchange. Second, the forecast for both Industrial Production and GDP has improved modestly. In November, 2010 IP was forecasted to be up 4.2%. Today, that forecast has moved to 4.4%. The same is true for GDP. In November, we were expecting 2010 GDP growth of 2.7%. Today, that has moved up to 2.9% growth. However, we remain cautious because job growth is expected to lag the recovery and we believe our growth is, in part, tied to non-farm payrolls. In terms of modeling 2010, here are a few things to consider: First, sales are expected to be up in the range of 6% to 10% with organic growth from price, share gain and market growth of 2 to 5 percentage points; acquisitions made in 2009 adding 3 percentage points; and foreign exchange contributing 1 to 2 percentage points. Again to repeat, a foreign exchange contribution of 1 to 2 percentage points will only yield $0.01 to $0.02 of EPS. Also, while sales comps versus 2009 get sequentially easier through April of 2010, we remain cautious since organic growth is trending at the lower end of our range with a great deal of economic uncertainty for second half of 2010. Second, gross margins in 2010 should be slightly ahead of 2009 with lower but positive cost and price inflation than in 2009. We expect to see gross margin expansion from organic growth, partially offset by unfavorable mix from consolidating Japan and India, which have lower gross margins. Third, operating expenses in 2010 will be up versus 2009 for two reasons: First, the incremental expenses from the businesses acquired in 2009 and second, a portion of the costs taken out last year will come back. Here’s how it breaks out. We expect that about one-third of the cost reduction will be permanent, another third will return -- things like merit increases and bonuses, and the final third is variable depending on growth in sales and earnings -- things like part-time hours, commissions, higher bonus and profit sharing. Bottom line, operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the organic portion of the business should improve slightly, assuming we hit the middle of our sales range. If the economy continues to strengthen and sales trends accelerate, we may choose to fund some additional sales and marketing programs to increase market share. Lastly, if we grow closer to the high end of the sales range, variable costs like bonuses, commissions and benefits will grow at a faster rate than sales based on the nature of these plans. Fourth, we will see favorable SG&A benefits in 2010 from a change in our paid time-off program worth about $0.25 per share. We expect that about a third will be realized in the first half of the year, with the remaining two-thirds appearing in the back half of 2010. And finally, we expect our tax rate to increase to 39.3% due to higher U.S. state taxes and an unfavorable mix of taxes from our foreign businesses. To conclude, we continue to be pleased with our execution and operating performance in a challenging environment, and are encouraged by the opportunities in front of us to gain share and create value for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for the release of January sales on Thursday, February 11. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Ernest at 847-535-4356, Nancy Hobor at 0065, or me at 0881. Thank you.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-10-14 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Ernest Duplessis - Vice President of Investor Relations Bill Chapman - Director of Investor Relations
Ernest Duplessis: This is Ernest Duplessis, Vice President of Investor Relations along with Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this audio webcast is to provide you with additional perspective on Grainger’s results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. For a complete view, be sure to reference our earnings release issued October 14, along with other information available on our Investor Relations website. Before we go any further, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in this press release and in this webcast constitute forward looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward looking statements. Our performance in the third quarter once again demonstrated the strength of Grainger’s business model and our ability to execute, despite a difficult economy. Sales were down 14% in the quarter, providing further evidence that we have yet to see an economic recovery. However, our sales performance, relative to the competition, provides further evidence that we are picking up market share. Strong cash flow generation of $275 million in the quarter was the result of solid execution and effective working capital management. There were a number of unusual items in the quarter. One of the purposes of this audio webcast is to further explain those items. The largest such item was the gain recognized after Grainger obtained 53% or a majority ownership in MonotaRO in Japan. We closed on this transaction in mid September and recorded the fair value of all acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the end of the 2009 third quarter, including $97 million in intangibles and goodwill, based on the market price of MonotaRO’s stock at the time of the transaction. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require. We also recorded a one time non-cash gain of $47 million pre-tax or $0.37 per share based on the step up value less our investment. Beginning with the 2009 fourth quarter, we will consolidate 100% of the results of operations from this subsidiary on a one month lag, then back out the 47% we don’t own below the net earning line. Let’s walk through two more unusual items in the 2009 third quarter; first, $0.06 per share benefit from the reduction in the LIFO reserve due to lower inflation on inventory purchases and lower inventory levels than previously estimated. Second, $0.04 cents per share benefit from the expiration of a statute related to a prior tax year. Reported earnings per share of $1.88, normalized for these items, would have been $1.41, down 20% versus the 2008 third quarter. Now let’s begin our discussion by reviewing total company results, then move into an evaluation of performance by segment. For the 2009 third quarter, company sales were $1.6 billion down 14%. Operating earnings were down 19%, but net earnings increased 3%, mostly reflecting the gains from unusual items. As just noted, reported earnings per share were $1.88 and that compares to $1.77 in the 2008 third quarter, restated down $0.02 to reflect the adoption of FSP 3-6-1 related to accounting for stock based compensation. Taking a closer look at some key drivers on the income statement, gross profit margins increased about 110 basis points to 41.5% versus 40.4% in the prior year. We benefited from 4% price inflation, which exceeded COGS inflation of 3% in the quarter. Excluding the benefit from the $10 million reduction in the LIFO reserve, gross profit margins for the company would have been 40.9%. Our strong gross margin helped to partially offset the sales decline as operating margins decreased 90 basis points to 11.7%. Ongoing cost reduction efforts led to a 7% decline in operating expenses year over year. These actions helped us in the quarter, but were not sufficient to offset the 14% decline in sales. We expect that about one third of the decline in operating expenses in 2009 to be permanent while the remainder may return with improved volume and the return of bonuses and other performance related costs. Let’s now focus on the key factors that drove performance during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following: First, sales by segment in the quarter and in the month of September. Second, an update on our Product Line Expansion Program in the United States. Third, operating performance by segment. Fourth, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we’ll wrap things up with some final thoughts about modeling the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, sales for the company were down 14% for the quarter. There were 64 selling days in the third quarter of both years. This 14% decrease consisted primarily of a 17% decline in volume partially offset by a 4% year over year increase in price. In addition, foreign exchange contributed one percentage point to the decline. Looking back on the quarter, daily sales dollars improved each successive month, although the percentage change was affected by the comparison with 2008. July was the toughest comparison, followed by September and August, respectively. To recap, sales were down 14% in July, down 13% in August and down 13% in September. It is important to note that we lapped the 4% price increase on August 1 of this year. A large portion of the 6% price inflation in the first half of the year was attributable to this increase. For the remainder of 2009, we are forecasting price inflation of around 2% and slightly ahead of COGS inflation. Let’s move on to our segments. As a reminder, beginning with the 2009 first quarter, we changed our segmentation to reflect the integration of Lab Safety Supply into the US branch based business. As a result, we now report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, and Panama, that are dissimilar in profitability and size, are now reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Beginning with the 2009 fourth quarter, we will report our subsidiary in Japan as part of Other Businesses. A spreadsheet containing daily sales history, recast for the revised segmentation, can be found on the Investor Relations web site under News Releases and Quarterly Supplemental Information. Sales in the United States, which represents 88% of total company sales, were down 14% for the quarter. Sales performance drivers were similar to company results with volume declines being partially offset by price increases. Given the size and diversity of Grainger’s customer base, we are often asked about what we are seeing in the economy. With that in mind, let’s take a look at sales in the United States for the quarter by customer end market. Government sales were down mid single digits versus last year. Commercial was down in the high single digits. Light manufacturing was down in the low double digits. Retail was down in the mid teens. Contractor was down in the high teens. Reseller was down in the low twenties. Heavy manufacturing was down in the high twenties. Sales in Canada, which represent 10% of total company sales, declined 13% in US dollars and 8% in local currency. We continued to see weakness in the forestry, manufacturing and gas sectors of the economy, while trends improved in the utilities, infrastructure construction and oil end markets. Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. This group includes our operations in Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China and Panama and represents 2% of total company sales. Sales for this group were up 11%, primarily the result of the business in India acquired in June, along with strong growth in China and Panama. This increase was partially offset by a 21% decline in Mexico due to foreign exchange. In pesos, sales in Mexico were up 2%, led by strength in the food industry along with oil and gas, while automotive and construction continued to lag. For the month of September, total company sales were down 13%. There were 22 sales days September of both years. A 15% decline in volume, partially offset by the benefit of 2% price, drove sales performance for the month. Now let’s move on to sales by segment for the month of September. Daily sales for the United States were down 14%. Customer end markets within the 50 states were as follows; Government sales were down mid single digits versus last year, although sales to state agencies were up mid single digits, commercial and light manufacturing were down high single digits, retail was down in the low double digits, contractor and reseller were down in the low twenties, heavy manufacturing was down in the mid twenties. For our Canadian segment, sales in September were down 11% in US dollars and down 9% in local currency for primarily the same reasons noted for the quarter. Sales for our Other Businesses were up 14%, primarily the result of the incremental sales from the business in India, along with strong growth in China. This sales increase was partially offset by a 15% decline in Mexico due to foreign exchange. In local currency, sales in Mexico were up 6%, primarily the result of an easy comparison. As we move into the fourth quarter, we should begin to benefit from some easier sales comparisons, particularly in the United States. Comparisons in Canada, however, will remain rather difficult as daily sales in local currency were up 16% in the 2008 fourth quarter. To review, total company sales reported in 2008 versus 2007 were; up 4% in October, down 2% in November and down 5% in December. Average daily sales dollars in the United States for the early part of October have remained fairly consistent with what we saw in September, but comparisons to 2008 will be 5 percentage points easier than what we were up against in September. Also, beginning in October, we will benefit from the inclusion of sales from the business in Japan. I’d now like to turn the mike over to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman: Let’s move on to a quick review of our Product Expansion initiative. Sales from products added to our offering accounted for $251 million in sales during the quarter. This compares to a $196 million contribution in the 2008 third quarter. As a reminder, we have tripled the number of skus in the Grainger catalog since 2005. Product Line Expansion has helped us pick up market share by making Grainger more relevant to customers by offering a broader product line. It also enables customers to save money by consolidating their MRO spend with Grainger. Let’s now take a closer look at operating performance. Operating earnings for the company declined by 19% versus the 2008 third quarter. This decline was primarily the result of the 14% sales decrease coupled with operating expenses, which declined at about half the rate of the sales decline. This was partially offset by an increase in gross profit margins. Operating earnings for both segments were down year over year, while the operating performance for the Other Businesses improved. Let’s now take a look at operating performance by segment. Operating earnings in the United States decreased by 15% versus the 2008 third quarter. Operating margins declined by 20 basis points to 14.6%. This performance was primarily the result of the 14% sales decline and operating expenses, which declined 7% for the quarter. Partially offsetting this decline in operating earnings was a robust 190 basis point increase in gross profit margins due primarily to price increases exceeding COGS inflation and the reduction in the LIFO inventory reserve. The 7% reduction in operating expenses was driven by lower payroll and benefits costs, which were due to lower headcount, reduced commissions and no bonus accruals. Going forward, we expect that roughly a third of the decrease in operating expenses will be permanent. In addition, approximately $10 million in synergies from the Lab Safety integration in the quarter partially offset the decline in operating earnings for this segment. Let’s move on to the segment in Canada where operating earnings were down 41% for the quarter. This decline was primarily due to reported sales in US dollars being down 13% coupled with a 260 basis point decline in gross profit margins. The lower gross profit margins in Canada were attributable to two things. First, higher cost of goods sold due to the effect of foreign exchange on products purchased from the United States, which represent about 25% of COGs. We were particularly affected by this given that many of the products sold in the third quarter were purchased from the United States in the first half of the year as the dollar’s value improved relative to the Canadian dollar. Second, a negative shift in mix due to better sales performance among large customers who generally pay lower prices. In Canadian dollars, operating earnings were down 38%. Operating results for the Other Businesses improved year over year, moving from a loss of $3 million in the 2008 third quarter to a loss of $2 million in 2009. The better performance was attributable to year over year operating improvement for all businesses in this group, including a return to profitability for our business in Mexico. Results were partially offset by operating losses from the recently acquired business in India. Let’s cover a few more items which influenced results for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1% versus 38.8% last year. The third quarter 2009 tax rate benefited from the expiration of a statute related to a prior tax year. Excluding the effect of this one time benefit, the effective tax rate for the 2009 third quarter was 39.1%, compared to 38.8% in the 2008 third quarter. The increase in the 2009 effective rate is due to lower earnings reported in non US tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates, as well as an increase in current estimates of overall US state income tax rates. Going forward, we expect the effective tax rate to continue to be at 39.1%. Lastly, let’s take a look at our operating cash flow for the quarter, which was $275 million, or nearly two times net income. Cash generated by the business through effective operating performance and strong working capital management, was used to fund capital expenditures of $36 million and return capital to shareholders through dividends. Please note that the level of capital expenditures will most likely pick up in the fourth quarter as we continue to add capacity to the US supply chain, including the west coast distribution center announced in May. Capital expenditures for the first nine months were $87 million and we expect to end the year with total capital expenditures below $150 million. During the quarter, we paid $35 million in dividends, reflecting the 15% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced in April. This marks the 38th consecutive year of increased dividends, a record of which we are very proud. We did not buy back any shares. Instead, during the last two quarters, we built our cash balance to invest in our supply chain and potentially pursue select acquisitions to penetrate particular vertical markets while valuations are depressed. That leads to our last topic, the deal announced on October 14. We reported the acquisition of Imperial Supplies LLC, a distributor of fleet maintenance products to the transportation industry. This business is headquartered in Green Bay, Wisconsin and will be reported as part of the US Segment. Imperial had $67 million in sales in 2008. The deal is expected to be accretive by $0.03 to $0.05 per share in 2010. This acquisition strengthens our position in a key vertical, the $4 billion transportation industry, where Grainger has only a small market share position. Imperial’s profitability is in line with the company’s operating margins, and we see an opportunity to improve these results through cost and revenue synergies. The cost synergies support our purchase valuation with revenue synergies providing upside value. As we look to the final quarter of the year, here are some general thoughts I’d like to leave with you. First, we are still waiting to see an improvement in underlying demand, although sales comparisons do get easier in the fourth quarter. Second, gross profit margins in the fourth quarter should be in the range of 40.5% to 41.5%, primarily due to lower volume rebates, smaller potential benefit from inventory reserves as some of this was recognized in the third quarter and finally a mix shift due to lower gross margins from the businesses acquired during 2009 in Japan and India. That being said, we still expect gross profit margins for the year to be above 2008. Through the first nine months, gross profit margins were 41.7%, up 120 basis points versus the comparable period last year. Third, we will face more difficult comparisons with operating expenses as we begin to lap the cost reductions implemented in the 2008 fourth quarter when sales growth began to decelerate. Last year, lower advertising, bonus accruals and commissions, along with a $4.6 million gain on the sale of real estate, contributed to operating expenses being lower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. We are currently forecasting operating expenses to be higher in the 2009 fourth quarter than in the 2009 third quarter given these factors coupled with the incremental expenses from the businesses acquired during the year. Fourth, as noted earlier, we will be consolidating the results of the business in Japan beginning in the fourth quarter. Total sales for this business in 2008 were $136 million, with operating margins in the mid to high single digits. Finally, we are making progress with the Lab Safety integration and we are on track to deliver the anticipated revenue and cost savings synergies by the middle of 2010. To date, we have generated $24 million of incremental revenue and that trend should allow us to achieve the bottom end of the projected range of $70 to $100 million in incremental revenue and $15 million in cost savings, which puts us on track to be closer to the high end of projected cost synergies of $20 to $30 million. To conclude, we continue to be pleased with our execution and operating performance in a very challenging environment. We are also very appreciative of our employees and how they have responded by maintaining extraordinary customer service. We strongly believe that this commitment to serving our customers should benefit our shareholders in the years to come through market share gains and even more effective cost leverage. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for November 18 when we will host our annual analyst meeting at our headquarters and release our October sales results. Normally, we would report our sales in the middle of the month, but we have decided to hold them for the analyst meeting. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Ernest at 847-535-4356, Nancy Hobor at 0065 or me at 0881.

===== 2009 Q2  (2009-07-15 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Laura Brown – VP IR William Chapman – Director IR
Laura Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Vice President of Investor Relations along with William Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to provide additional perspective on Grainger’s results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 via this audio web cast. You should also reference our earnings release issued July 15th, along with other information available on our Investor Relations website. Before we go any further, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in this press release and in this web cast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. The second quarter showed the relative strength of Grainger’s business model and continued execution of our strategy. In spite of weak economic conditions, sales were down 13% and earnings per share down 15%. Our sales performance in this economy indicates that we are picking up market share relative to competitors. Operating cash flow of $190 million in the quarter is further evidence of strong execution and effective working capital management. Let’s begin by reviewing total company results, then move into a discussion of performance by segment. For the 2009 second quarter, company sales were $1.5 billion. Operating earnings were down 17% and net earnings declined 18%. Earnings per share were $1.21 and that compares to $1.42 in the 2008 second quarter. As a reminder beginning with 2009, we adopted an accounting change related to stock-based compensation. This adoption led to a change in the calculation of earnings per share. As a result, earnings per share for the 2008 second quarter were originally reported $0.01 higher or $1.43. The revised calculation also resulted in a $0.01 reduction in the 2009 second quarter earnings per share. For additional information and a restatement of last year’s earnings per share by quarter, please see page K-41 in our 2008 Form 10-K. Taking a closer look at some key drivers on the income statement, gross profit margins increased about 60 basis points to 40.8% versus 40.2% in the prior year. We benefited from positive inflation recovery in the quarter, although we expect some of this benefit versus prior year to dissipate going forward as we lap the 4% price increase implemented for Grainger U.S. in August of 2008. Our strong gross margin helped to partially offset the sales decline as operating margins decreased 50 basis points to 10%. Our cost reduction efforts led to a 10% decline in operating expenses year-over-year. These actions helped us in the quarter, but were not sufficient to offset the 13% decline in sales. Other factors that affected comparability between the second quarters of 2009 and 2008 included the following. First, severance charges. In February we announced the decision to eliminate 300 to 400 jobs over the course of the year. During the quarter, we eliminated nearly 100 positions, resulting in severance charges of $3 million or $0.02per share. Second, there were no gains on the sale of property in the 2009 quarter versus $0.02 per share of gains in last year’s quarter. Finally, last year’s quarter included a $0.05 per share provision for a legal reserve that did not repeat in 2009. Let’s now focus on the key factors that drove performance during the quarter. In doing so, we’ll cover the following. First, sales by segment in the quarter and in the month of June. Second, an update on our Product Line Expansion Program in the United States, and third, operating performance by segment. And, then we’ll wrap things up with our cash generation and capital deployment. As mentioned earlier, sales for the company were down 13% for the quarter. There were 64 selling days in the second quarter of both years. This 13% decrease consisted primarily of a 19% decline in volume partially offset by a 6% year over year increase in price. In addition, foreign exchange contributed two percentage points to the decline. Incremental sales from businesses acquired over the past 12 months in Wisconsin, Canada and India contributed one percentage point. Incremental sales for products related to the H1N1 virus contributed less than one percentage point. The sales of seasonal products were not a factor in the quarter. Looking back on the quarter, daily sales in dollars improved each month, although the percentage change was affected by the comparison with 2008. We had tougher comparisons in April and June and an easier comparison in May. To recap, daily sales were down 15% in April, down 10% in May and down 13% in June. Let’s move on to our segments. As a reminder, beginning with the 2009 first quarter, we changed our segmentation to reflect the integration of Lab Safety Supply into the U.S. branch-based business. As a result, we now report two segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, and Panama, that are dissimilar in profitability and size, are now reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. For your assistance, a spreadsheet containing daily sales history, recast for the new segmentation, can be found on the Investor Relations web site under News Releases and Quarterly Supplemental Information. Sales in the United States, which represents about 88% of total company sales, were down 12% for the quarter. Sales performance drivers were similar to company results with volume declines being partially offset by price increases. Given the size and diversity of our customer base, we are often asked about what we are seeing in the economy. With that in mind, let’s take a look at sales in the United States for the quarter by customer end-market. Government sales were up low single digits versus last year. Commercial was down in the high single digits. Retail and light manufacturing were down in the low double digits. Contractor was down in the mid-teens. Reseller was down in the high teens. And heavy manufacturing was down almost 30%. Sales in Canada, which represent about 10% of total company sales, decreased 19% in US dollars, but were down 6% in local currency. Sales results were negatively affected by the Easter holiday in April and being closed on Good Friday, which resulted in having one less selling day versus 2008. The Canadian economy remained weak throughout the quarter, particularly in the forestry, manufacturing, transportation and mining sectors. This weakness contributed to sales declines in most provinces during the quarter, though sales to the government remained strong, as did sales to utilities and infrastructure related sectors. Let’s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at Other Businesses. This group includes our operations, in the order of size, in Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China and Panama and represents about 2% of total company sales. Sales for this group were down 9%, primarily the result of a large decline in Mexico and Puerto Rico, partially offset by increases in China and Panama along with one month of sales from the business acquired in India. For Mexico, sales in dollars were down 27%, down 7% in pesos reflecting the continued weakness in manufacturing, natural resources and hospitality sectors of the Mexican economy. For the month of June, total company sales were down 13% on a daily basis. There were 22 sales days in the month versus 21 last year. Volume declines partially offset by the benefit of previous price increases continued to be the story in June. In addition, we were hit by a one percentage point headwind due to unfavorable exchange rates between the US dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. In addition, lower sales of seasonal products due to mild weather across most of North America contributed about one percentage point to the sales decline for the month. As noted in our last audio web cast, we expected the percentage change in daily sales in June to be weaker than May, and that turned out to be the case. The biggest factor was that we had a tougher comparison in June. Last year, daily sales in June were up a robust 10%, whereas daily sales in May were up a more modest 7% versus 2007. Let’s move on to sales by segment for the month of June. Daily sales for the United States were down 14%. Customer end-markets within the 50 states were as follows. Government sales were up low single-digits versus last year. Commercial, light manufacturing and retail were down in the low double-digits. Contractor was down in the mid-teens. Reseller was down in the low 20’s. And heavy manufacturing was down in the high 20’s. For our Canadian segment, daily sales in June were down 15% in US dollars and down 6% in local currency for primarily the same reasons noted for the quarter. Daily sales for our Other Businesses were up 6%, primarily the result of increases in China and Panama, along with incremental sales from the acquisition in India. This 6% increase was partially offset by continued declines in Mexico and Puerto Rico. In Mexico, daily sales were down 24% in US dollars, and down 2% in local currency. As we move into the first part of July, the general sales trends experienced in the second quarter of the year are continuing. To date, we have yet to see an increase in underlying demand. I’d now like to turn the microphone over to William Chapman.
William Chapman: Thanks Laura. Let’s move on to a quick review of our product expansion initiative. Sales from products added to our offering accounted for $231 million in sales during the quarter. This compares to a $169 million contribution in the 2008 second quarter. As a reminder we have tripled the number of SKU’s in the Grainger catalog since 2005. This has helped us pick up share by allowing us to say yes more often to customers. It also enables customers to save money by consolidating their MRO spend with Grainger. Let’s now take a closer look at operating performance. Operating earnings for the company decreased by 17% versus the 2008 second quarter. This decline was primarily the result of the 13% sales decrease coupled with operating expenses, which declined at a lower rate than sales. This was partially offset by an increase in gross profit margins. Operating earnings for both segments and the Other Businesses were down year-over-year. Let’s now take a look at operating performance by segment. Operating earnings in the United States decreased by 16% versus the 2008 second quarter. Operating margins declined by 60 basis points to 13%. This performance was primarily the result of the 12% sales decline and operating expenses, which declined at a slower rate than sales, down 7% for the quarter. Partially offsetting this decline in operating earnings was a robust 100 basis point increase in gross profit margins due primarily to price. Gross margins would have been another 50 basis points higher, but were reduced by the free freight promotion. We have decided to end the freight promotion because we did not see a sufficient lift in sales. However, we expect to hire additional customer facing employees in the back half of the year to selectively invest for growth, particularly as we come out of the recession. Let’s move on to the segment in Canada where operating earnings decreased 39% for the quarter. This decline was primarily due to reported sales in US dollars being down 19% coupled with a 210 basis point decline in gross profit margins. The lower gross profit margins in Canada were attributable to three things. First, higher cost of goods sold due to the effect of foreign exchange on products purchased from the United States. Second, growth among larger customers who generally pay lower prices and finally, an increase in inventory reserves. In Canadian dollars, operating earnings were down 30%. Operating results for the Other Businesses declined year over year, moving from a loss of $1.9 million in the 2008 second quarter to a loss of $3.3 million in 2009. The decline in performance was primarily attributable to Mexico moving to a loss position due to the steep 27% sales decline, and the inclusion of losses from the business in India for the month of June. Results were partially offset by lower losses in China versus the 2008 quarter. Let’s cover a few more items which affected results for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.0% versus 38.6% last year. The higher effective tax rate this quarter was primarily the result of lower earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower income tax rates, as well as increases in current estimates of overall U.S. state income tax rates. Lastly, let’s take a look at our operating cash flow for the quarter, which was $190 million, or 206% of net income. Cash generated by the business through effective operating performance and strong working capital management, was used to fund capital expenditures of $25 million and return capital to shareholders. Please note that the level of capital expenditures should pick up in the back half of the year as we begin to work on the west coast distribution center announced in May. During the quarter, we paid $35 million in dividends, reflecting the 15% increase in the quarterly dividend rate announced in April. This marks the 38th consecutive year of increased dividends, a record of which we are very proud. We did not buy back any shares this quarter, although 5.7 million shares remain on the current authorization. Looking forward, we have yet to see any sign of a pick up in demand. The good news is that the steep decline that began in the 2008 fourth quarter has moderated for now and things have not gotten worse. We’re managing expenses tightly given our current sales levels, focusing on the things we can control. In the event the business environment deteriorates from here, we have contingencies in place to further reduce our cost structure. But for the time being, these actions do not seem necessary. With that as a backdrop, until we have greater visibility, we do not believe it is appropriate to provide guidance. In the meantime, we are taking additional steps to gain market share using our financial strength. We continue to add modestly to our sales force to further improve customer coverage and are purposely keeping inventory availability at record levels to meet the unplanned needs of our customers and gain market share. As mentioned earlier, we are also selectively investing for growth to drive awareness and customer penetration. As we look at the second half of 2009, here are some general thoughts I’d like to leave with you. First, we have not seen an up tick in underlying demand, although sales comparisons do get easier in the fourth quarter. The budget crisis being experienced in many states across the US may eventually affect our sales to these customers going forward. Second, gross profit margins in aggregate for the second half of 2009 should be roughly equivalent to the second half of 2008, although lower volume rebates could put pressure on margins in the fourth quarter. That being said, we still expect gross profit margins for the year to be above 2008. Third, we will face more difficult comparisons with operating expenses as we begin to lap the cost reductions implemented in the 2008 fourth quarter when sales growth began to decelerate. As previously discussed, we are selectively investing for growth by adding more sales representatives and customer facing employees. We still expect the incremental expense for growth initiatives to be in the range of $25 million to $50 million, although more likely toward the lower end of that range since we have decided not to continue with the free freight promotion. We are also pushing ahead with the Lab Safety integration and still expect to harvest the incremental sales of $70 million to $100 million and $20 million to $30 million cost synergies as originally forecasted, although we should see the majority of that in 2010. To date, we have generated about $13 million of incremental revenue and $5 million in cost savings as a result of the integration, and remain on track. As we move forward, some of these integration benefits will hinge on the release of the 2010 Grainger catalog in February, which will include several thousand Lab Safety products, along with the conversion of Lab Safety’s IT system to the Grainger SAP system in the early part of next year. To conclude, while we certainly would like to see a better top line, we are very proud of our earnings performance in the face of a very difficult economy. Earnings per share down 15% on a 13% sales decline is a respectable accomplishment. We are also very proud and appreciative of our employees and how they have responded, paring back expenses while at the same time maintaining extraordinary customer service. We believe that our steadfast dedication to maintaining our customer-facing resources should benefit our shareholders in the years to come through share gains and even more effective cost leverage. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for August 12th when we plan to release July sales results. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura at 847-535-0409, Nancy Hobor at 847-535-0065 or me at 847-535-0881. Thank you.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-01-26 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Laura D. Brown - Vice President, Investor Relations William D. Chapman - Director, Investor Relations
Laura Brown: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me is Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to be sharing with you today Grainger's fourth quarter results as of December 31, 2008 via this audio webcast. This recording is intended to provide you with more information related to our recent performance. Please also reference our 2008 fourth quarter and full year earnings release issued January 26th in addition to other information on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast. Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risks and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Let's begin by taking a look at our full year 2008 results. Sales, net earnings and earnings per share were all records for Grainger. Sales of $6.9 billion were up 7% versus 2007. There was one extra selling day in the year versus 2007, so sales were up 6% on a daily basis. Net earnings increased 13% versus 2007 and earnings per share of $6.04 increased 22% versus $4.94 in 2007. Taking a closer look at the income statement for the year, gross profit margins increased about 40 basis points to 41%. Operating margins increased almost 100 basis points to 11.4%. Consistent with our guidance, the operating margin expansion was driven y a near equal mix of improved gross margins and operating expense leverage. For comparability, it is important to note that our record earnings per share of $6.04 for the year 2008 included the following items: First, $0.13 per share in charges. This consisted of the $0.05 from the settlement of a government lawsuit recognized in the second quarter and $0.08 related to the writedown of our investment in a joint venture in the fourth quarter, which I will discuss in more detail in a few moments. Second, $9 million in net interest expense in 2008 versus $9 million in net interest income in 2007, representing a negative swing of $18 million. And third, $8.6 million in gains on the sales of property versus $6.6 million in 2007. Pre-tax return on invested capital or ROIC for the year increased 130 basis points to 29.8% from 28.5% a year ago. This improvement was the results of better operating performance, partially offset by an increase in net working assets. Let's now take a look at our 2008 fourth quarter results. Sales of $1.6 billion were down 1% versus last year's fourth quarter. In a few moments, we will address some of the factors that contributed to our sales performance. Operating earnings increased 8% and net earnings increased 3%. Earnings per share grew by 9% to $1.39. As noted a few moments ago, the quarter included the writedown of the company's 49.9% ownership interest in Asia Pacific Brands India Limited. The bankruptcy of a major supplier and the weakened global economy impaired the value of this investment. The writedown is reported below the operating earnings line. It amounted to $6 million or $0.08 per share. Excluding this charge, earnings per share for the quarter would have been up 15%. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics - first, sales by customer and market and geography in the quarter and in the month of December; second, an update on our key growth initiatives in the United States; third, our operating performance; and last, our cash generation and capital deployment. As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter were down 1% versus the prior year. There were 64 selling days in the fourth quarter in both years. The 1% decline for the quarter included a 2 percentage point decline related to foreign exchange, partially offset by the combination of positive price inflation and negative volume growth. Growth slowed progressively during the quarter as daily sales were up 4% in October, down 2% in November and down 5% in December. As mentioned in our last audio webcast, we had anticipated a drop off in volume later in the fourth quarter given the economy and the expectation of more plant and business shutdowns around year end. Grainger's Branch-based business segment sales, which include operations in the United States, Mexico, China, and Panama, were flat to prior year. Similar to company results, positive price inflation essentially offset the decline in volume. Pricing contributed 5 percentage points for the quarter. The sale of seasonal products was not a factor in the quarter. Sales in the U.S. were down 1%. Product expansion contributed positively for the quarter, offset by declines in sales in the top 25 metropolitan markets. On a geographic basis, sales performance was flat in the western part of the United States and negative in the eastern portion of the country. Sales performance for the quarter by end market was as follows - government sales were up in the low single digits; commercial and reseller were down in the low single digits; light manufacturing, retail and contractor were down in the mid single digits, and heavy manufacturing was down in the high single digits. Sales in Mexico for the fourth quarter were down 11% in U.S. dollars versus the 2007 fourth quarter, but were up 8% in local currency. We continue to benefit from Mexico's market expansion program. As of year end, we had 22 branches in the Mexico, giving us national distribution capabilities. Since August, this business has experienced slowing sales growth due to the deceleration of the Mexican economy. Sales for China were just under $3 million for the quarter and nearly $10 million for the year. Growth with existing customers has driven the majority of the increase. New customer acquisition and profitability remain the primary focus for this business. For the Acklands-Grainger Branch-based segment, sales were down 6% in U.S. dollars, up 16% in local currency. In spite of an overall soft Canadian economy, the Acklands team is continuing to drive market share gains, particularly in the agriculture, mining, oil and gas, and government customer segments. Sales were up strongly in all geographic regions with the exception of British Columbia, which was down mid single digits primarily due to the forestry sector. Finally, Lab Safety sales for the quarter were down 3% versus a year ago. The contribution from the acquisition of Highsmith was a positive 9%. Results from Lab's core business continued to decline. We are optimistic about the expected upside in sales and cost synergies from integrating Lab Safety into the U.S. Branch-based business, as announced at our November analysts meeting. We expect incremental revenue of $70 to $100 million and cost synergies of $20 to $30 million over the next 18 months as we work to integrate the two businesses. For the month of December, total company sales were down 5% on a daily basis. There were 22 sales days in the month versus 20 in December last year. Two percentage points of headwind were experienced due to unfavorable exchange rates between the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. The sale of seasonal products was not a factor in the month. In the Grainger Branch-based business segment, December sales were also down 5% on a daily basis. In the U.S. business, all customer end markets were below December 2007 as follows - government was down low single digits, reseller and commercial were down mid single digits, light manufacturing and contractor were down high single digits, retail was down low double digits, and heavy manufacturing was down in the mid teens. As mentioned in the quarterly results, volume was notably down in the top 25 metropolitan markets. In general, sales performance was better in the western states versus the eastern part of the United States. In Mexico, December sales were down 14% in U.S. dollars, but up 7% in local currency. As in the United States, extended manufacturing shutdowns occurred in Mexico in the month of December. For the Acklands Branch-based segment, sales were down 7% in U.S. dollar, but up 15% in local currency. Despite overall economic slowness in Canada, Acklands continued to deliver sales growth in the mid teens. Slowness in the forestry sector negatively affected sales, most notably in British Columbia. All other geographies, with the exception of the Atlantic, and all customer end markets were up in the month of December. Lab Safety's performance for the month of December was disappointing. Sales were down 11% and would have been down 18% without the acquisition of Highsmith. Extended plant slowdowns and the deteriorating industrial economic environment materially affected Lab's monthly performance. As we move into the first quarter of 2009, the sales weakness seen in December is continuing into January. The daily sales rate for January is running below the 5% daily decline reported in December. The three primary factors affecting this sales decline are the continued weakness of the overall economy as seen in continued job losses and business failures; foreign exchange, which persists as a significant headwind, particularly for Acklands-Grainger in Canada even though this business continues to grow nicely in local currency; and lastly, the timing of the New Year's holiday. We were open for business on Friday, January 2nd, but generated less than a halfday of normal sales volume. Excluding the effect of January 2nd, the run rate for daily sales is slightly below the 5% decline seen in December. During the quarter, performance for the market expansion and product line expansion programs was materially affected by the decline experienced in the general economy. For the year, incremental market expansion sales were $476 million versus $402 million in 2007, an 18% increase. Program operating earnings in 2008 were $43.2 million, an increase of 102% over prior year. We expect to benefit from these investments through 2013, even in light of these challenging economic times. Product expansion accounted for 1 percentage point of sales growth in the quarter. This program contributed an incremental $687 million in sales in 2008 versus $349 million in 2007. We are very pleased with the contributions from this program and plan to continue to expand our product line into the foreseeable future. Effective with the launch of Grainger's 2009 catalog, we will have over 235,000 SKUs in the catalog. This is a net increase of 52,000 SKUs year-over-year. The number of SKUs in the Grainger catalog has increased from 82,000 in 2005, essentially tripling our product offering in just four years. And now, I'd like to turn things over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman: Thanks, Laura. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the company increased by 8% versus the 2007 fourth quarter. This improvement came entirely from the Grainger Branch-based segment. This increase was the result of improved gross margins through positive inflation recovery and operating expense leverage, despite the 1% decline in sales. Let's now take a look at operating performance by segment. Operating earnings for the Grainger Branch-based businesses increased 13% versus the 2007 fourth quarter. Operating margins increased 170 basis points to 14%. This operating margin expansion was primarily the result of a 120 basis point improvement in gross margins combined with operating expense leverage. Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined by about 50 basis points. Our expense leverage was aided by lower advertising, sales commissions, bonus, employee benefits and severance costs, along with a reduction in the company's bad debt reserve due to better collection efficiency. In addition, gains on the sale of real estate related to the market expansion program partially offset operating expenses for the quarter by $4.6 million versus $1.8 million in the 2007 fourth quarter. Pre-tax ROIC for the Grainger Branch-based segment increased 200 basis points for the year to 38.7% versus 36.7% in 2007, primarily reflecting the improvements in operating performance. Let's move on to the Acklands-Grainger Branch-based segment, where operating earnings decreased 14% for the quarter due to the negative effects of foreign currency. In Canadian dollars, operating earnings were up 5% versus last year's fourth quarter. This was the result of strong sales growth and higher gross profit margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses. In U.S. dollars, operating expenses included a $2 million reserve for a potential loss due to the bankruptcy of a freight payment processor. Also in U.S. dollars, operating margins in Canada decreased 80 basis points to 7.7% for the quarter versus 2007. For the full year, operating margins increased 50 basis points to 7.5% versus 7.0%. Pre-tax ROIC improved 140 basis points to 14.3% in 2008 versus 12.9% a year ago. We continue to be pleased with operational improvements in our Canadian business. Operating earnings for the Lab Safety segment decreased by 57% for the fourth quarter versus 2007. The decline in higher-margin core Lab Safety sales drove gross profit margins lower. Highsmith integration expenses also negatively affected performance. A combined leadership team with the Branch-based business in the United States was established in mid-December and integration efforts are just getting under way. Let's cover a few more items which affected results for the quarter. Higher interest expense represented a drag on earnings versus the prior year. In May of 2008 the company obtained a four-year term loan of $500 million. As a result of this loan, the company had $3.5 million in net interest expense in the quarter versus $200,000 in net interest expense in the 2007, representing a $3.3 million negative swing. The effective tax rate for the 2008 fourth quarter was 37.9% versus 38.1% in the 2007 quarter. Excluding transactions related to equity earnings in unconsolidated entities and the joint venture writedown, the effective tax rate was 36.7% and 38.5%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the 2008 fourth quarter was primarily the result of a lower weighted average state tax rate and increased deductibility of executive compensation expenses. For 2009 we are estimating the effective tax rate to be approximately 38.9% excluding the effect of equity in net income of unconsolidated entities. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow. Operating cash flow was $195 million for the quarter and $530 million for the year. For 2008, we used our strong cash flow to fund growth initiatives through capital expenditures of $195 million. We also returned cash to shareholders through $394 million in share repurchases and $122 million in dividends. In November, we gave annual sales guidance of negative 5% to plus 5%, and since then macroeconomic trends have deteriorated. Based on our sales run rate in January, we are somewhat below the low end of the range, so we are implementing actions now for weaker sales. At this time we are not in a position to provide 2009 annual sales and earnings guidance due to economic uncertainty and a lack of visibility beyond mid-January. To conclude, we are pleased about the results for the quarter, particularly given the weakening economy, with operating earnings up 8% and earnings per share up 9% or up 15% excluding the $0.08 charge. Going forward we are encouraged about our opportunity to continue to serve customers and gain market share despite the challenging and uncertain times. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for the release of January sales on Wednesday, February 11th.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-12 13:45:00) =====

Presentation:
Laura D. Brown - Vice President, Investor Relations: Hello, this is Laura Brown, Vice President of Investor Relations; and I'm here with Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. Welcome to Grainger's quarterly audio webcast covering results for the second quarter ended June 30th 2008. This recording is intended to provide you with information on our recent performance. Please use this information in conjunction with the earnings release, and other financial information posted on our Investor Relations website. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risks and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. Grainger posted record sales of $1.8 billion in the 2008 second quarter. Sales were up 10% versus last year's second quarter. Both quarters contain 64 selling days. Operating earnings increased 11% and net earnings increased 8%. Earnings per share grew by 18% to $1.43. It is important to note that these results include a special charge. During the quarter, the company recognized $0.05 per share in unallocated expenses for our legal reserve. This expense relates to allegations involving sourced items and the Trade Agreement Act compliance under the company's GSA contract. Excluding this charge, operating earnings were up 14%, net earnings were up12%, and earnings per share were up 22%. Operating margins increased about 10 basis points in the quarter to 10.5%, once again excluding the charge operating increased 40 basis points to 10.8%. This operating margin expansion was due to positive operating expense leverage and an 18 basis point improvement in gross profit margins. Again excluding the charge, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased from 29.6% in the second quarter of 2007 to about 29.3% in the 2008 second quarter. The 18% increase in earnings per share for the quarter was a combination of the growth in net earnings in our share repurchase activity. During the quarter, we purchased 85,000 shares for $75 million. Over the last 12 months, we have bought back about 9.3 million shares of stock. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by customer end market and geography in the quarter and in the month of June; second, an update on our key growth initiatives in the United States; third, our operating performance; and last, out cash generation in capital deployment. Sales growth in the quarter of 10% largely consisted of market share gains as general economic growth was minimal with U.S. GDP growth expected to be 1.7%. Sales price inflation contributed more than 2 percentage points to sales growth. Foreign exchange from our businesses in Canada and Mexico added about 1 percentage point to the top-line. In addition, our sales growth benefited by about 1 percentage point from the timing of the Easter holiday, which fell in March this year versus April a year ago. Sales in Grainger's branch based business, which includes operations in the United States, Mexico, and China increased 9%. The company's two main growth programs market expansion and product line expansion contributed nearly 6 percentage points to this growth. Similar to total company results, the timing of the Easter holiday also contributed about 1 percentage point to the top line. The sale of seasonal products were not a factor in the quarter. Similarly, the flooding that occurred in several states in mid-western United States did not affect the sales growth rate for the quarter. Sales in United States increased 9%. This increase was driven by growth to all customer and markets. Here is its complete list: government was up low-double digits; Light manufacturing and commercial were up high-single digits; heavy manufacturing, contractor and reseller were up mid-single digits; and retail was up low-single digits. On a geographic basis within United States, we saw a strong sales growth across all geographic regions with the exception of the Great Lakes in the Southeast, which grew in mid-single digits. Sales in Mexico were up 25%, driven primarily by the increased market share accompanying from our expansion program. In addition, the timing of the Easter holiday added about 5 percentage points. In local currency, Mexico was up 20%. For the Acklands Grainger branch-based segment in Canada, sales were up 24%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of Easter. In local currency, Acklands was up 14%. We saw a continued strength from customers in oilsands, mining and government, partially offset by weakness in forestry customers. Sales for the Lab Safety Supply segment were essentially flat for the quarter, excluding sales from the McFeeley's acquisition completed in May 2007, Lab was down 2%. We remain disappointed with the lack growth, particularly from sales to manufacturing customers and from safety and security products. We are developing a plan to improve the sales effectiveness, of this business, and expect to show that in November at our annual analyst meeting. Let's move on to sales results for the month of June. Company sales in June were up 10%. June had 21 selling days, the same number as June of 2007. Foreign exchange contributed about 1 percentage point to total company growth, while the sales of seasonal products were not a factor in the month. For the Grainger Branch-based segment, June sales accelerated to 10% growth, following the 6% growth posted in May. Sales in the United States for June were also up 10%. Let's take a look at results by customer end-market for the month. Commercial was up in the low-double digits; government, light manufacturing and reseller were up in high single digits. Heavy manufacturing and contractor were up mid-single digits. And retail was up low-single digits. Growth by geographic region in the United States, essentially follow the patterns described for the quarter. Sales in Mexico were up 15%, 9% in local currency. For the Acklands Grainger branch-based segment, sales were up 17%, 11% in local currency. Sales for the Lab Safety Supply segment in June were down 2%. As we move into the third quarter, we are encouraged by the early read on July sales growth. For the first two weeks of July, daily sales is tracking within our guidance for the year of 7% to 10% growth. Now I would like to turn the call over to Bill Chapman.
William D. Chapman - Director, Investor Relations: Thanks Laura. Let's move on to a brief review of our primary growth initiatives in the United States. During the quarter, market expansion and product line expansion once again delivered incremental sales growth and market share gains. As Laura noted, these two programs contributed about 6 percentage points of the 9% sales growth for the segment. Over the past five years, the market expansion program has improved our presence and penetration in the top 25 markets across the United States. During the quarter, we completed ten Branch projects. Five more are expected in the back half of the year, which will complete all six phases of market expansion. Despite the completion of the program this year, we expect market expansion to continue to deliver incremental sales and earnings through 2013. Let's now take a look at the product line expansion program. Part of the value we bring to customers is being a one stop shop for all the MRO items they need to repair and maintain their facilities. Since the program began in 2006, we have added more than 100,000 new products to the catalog. In addition, we have added another 35,000 products that are available to customers now and will be featured in our 2009 catalog in February. This program coupled with improved local availability resulting from market expansion has enabled Grainger to say yes, more often to our customers. As a result, we have deepened our relationship with customers and have captured market share. Given the success to date, we expect to continue to add new products and drive growth for several more years. Second quarter operating earnings for the company increased by 11% versus the 2007 second quarter. The improvement came from the Grainger branch-based segment in Acklands Grainger. This 11% increase for the company was the result of positive operating leverage attained through the 10% sales growth. Again, excluding the $0.05 charge, operating earnings were up 14%. Before we jump into operating performance by segment, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the effect of escalating raw materials and fuel prices on our performance. Inflation continues to be top of line for many customers and investors. Price increases from metal, petroleum, and other commodities are well documented. So how does this affect Grainger? One of the benefits of our size and scale is the fact that we have contractual agreements with many of our product and transportation suppliers that limits the amount of cost inflation we will accept each year. This allows us to thoughtfully plan the amount of price inflation we will pass on to our customers as part of our February catalogue release. Entering 2008, we originally forecasted price inflation of about 2% slightly above the pattern of the last few years. Given the extraordinary commodity inflation to-date in 2008, we've seen more cost inflation than originally expected. As a result, we increased prices on approximately 40,000 steel based products in May, and we now expect price inflation slightly above the 2% for the year. As inflationary pressures continue, we will pass those higher costs on to our customers through price increases. Let's now take a look at operating performance by segment. Operating earnings for the Grainger branch-based businesses increased 13% versus the 2007 second quarter. Operating margins increased about 50 basis points to 13.4%. This margin expansion was primarily the result of positive operating expense leverage, combined with a 30 basis point improvement in gross margins. Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined about 20 basis points, despite absorbing higher spending in Mexico for the expansion program, and continued operating losses from the business in China. Pre-tax ROIC for this segment declined 20 basis points to 36.9% reflecting improvements in operating performance, offset by additional investments in working capital and branches. Let's move on to the Acklands Grainger branch- based segment, where operating earnings increased 52% for the quarter, the result of the 24% sales increase in operating expenses, which grew at a slower rate than sales. Operating margins in Canada increased 20 basis points to 8.1% for the quarter resulting from the positive operating leverage. Pre-tax ROIC improved to 14.5% versus 12.1% a year ago. We continued to be pleased with the operational improvements in our Canadian business. This business acquired Excel Industriel in Quebec during the quarter adding about $11 million Canadian in annual sales. Operating earnings for the Lab Safety segment decreased by 5% for the second quarter versus 2007. The flat sales growth and higher operating expenses were responsible for this performance. Although Lab remains a very profitable business, the sluggish sales growth continues to be a disappointment. The recently announced acquisition of Highsmith is forecasted at $20 million to $30 million in sales in the second half of the year, but integration costs are expected to reduce profitability during the same period. Within 12 months, the acquisition is expected to breakeven. Lastly, let's take look at cash flow. Operating cash flow was $106 million for the quarter. During the quarter, the company used its cash flow and the proceeds from $500 million in intermediate term debt to payoff $330 million in short-term debt. Fund growth initiatives through capital expenditures of $72 million and return cash to shareholders through dividends of $31 million and $75 million in share repurchases. The majority of capital expenditures were dedicated to branch expansion in the United States, Canada and Mexico. As announced in May, the company secured a four year term loan of $500 million. The debt is carrying a floating interest rate tied to the LIBOR rate and will begin to amortize in the second year of the loan. As a result of this loan in a lower cash balance than a year ago, the company had $2.5 million in net interest expense in the quarter versus $3.5 million in net interest income in the 2007 quarter representing about a $6 million negative swing. As mentioned in today's earnings release, we reiterated our earnings per share guidance and continued to expect 2008 earnings per share of $5.80 to $6.10 including the $0.05 charge. Looking forward, here are some additional items to consider as you think about the remainder of the year. The 2008 third quarter will have 64 selling days, versus 63 selling days in 2007 third quarter. The 2007 third quarter included $1.3 million or $0.01 per share for gains on the sale of assets. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 38.9% in 2008, versus 38.5% on 2007. Excluding the effect of equity and net income from unconsolidated entities, the back half of 2008 will include $0.02 to $0.03 per share of dilution from the Highsmith acquisition made by Lab Safety Supply on July 10. To conclude, we are very pleased about the results for the quarter with sales up 10% and earnings per share up 18%, up 22% excluding the charge. And we remain optimistic about the remainder of the year. Thank you for your interest in Grainger and please mark your calendar for the following events. August 12, when we plan to issue sales results for July; September 25th, when we will host our first Analyst Day in Toronto, Canada; October 14th, when we expect to report third quarter results; and November 19th, when we will host our annual analyst meeting in our headquarters in the Chicago area. Thank you.

Presentation:
Laura Brown - Vice President, Investor Relations: Hello. This is Laura Brown, Vice President of Investor Relations; and I am here with Bill Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. Welcome to Grainger's quarterly audio webcast covering results for the first quarter ending March 31st, 2008. This recording is intended to provide you with information on our recent performance. We invite you to use this information in conjunction with the earnings release and other financial information posted on our Investor Relations website. Before we begin, I'd like to reinforce the fact that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and this webcast constitute forward-looking information. This information is based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward-looking statements. First quarter, 2008 sales were up 7% versus last year's first quarter. Both quarters contained 64 selling days. Net earnings increased 12% and earnings per share grew by 22% to $1.43. Sales, earnings, and earnings per share were all quarterly records. Operating margins increased 70 basis points in the quarter to 11.2%. This operating margin expansion was due to positive operating expense leverage and a modest increase in gross profit margins. As noted at our analyst meeting in November, we expect operating margin expansion going forward to come from a combination of gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage. Operating expenses as a percent of sales moved down from 30.4% in the first quarter of 2007 to 29.7% in the 2008 first quarter, led by the Grainger branch-based segment. And pretax return on invested capital or ROIC increased 60 basis points to 29.4% from 28.8% a year ago. Earnings contributions from the company's growth programs combined with efforts to improve productivity led to this performance. The 22% increase in earnings per share for the quarter was a combination of the 12% increase in net earnings in our aggressive share repurchase. During the quarter, we bought back 2.6 million shares of stock for $196 million. This is an addition to the 415,000 shares we received in early January as part of the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program. At the November analyst meeting, we disclosed the intention to repurchase between $180 million and $220 million worth of shares in 2008. The company plans to remain active in the market throughout the remainder of the year, although not as aggressively as we were in the first quarter. Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics. First, sales by customers end market and geography in the quarter ended in the month of March; second, an update of our key growth initiatives in the United States; third, our operating performance; fourth, our cash generation and capital deployment; and last, our revised 2008 EPS guidance of $5.80 to $6.10. As described in the press release, the company's two main growth programs market expansion and product line expansion contributed a total of about 2% points to sales growth. Most of that attributable to product line expansion. That being said, it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate sales contribution from each program, because they have become so closely intertwined. Foreign exchange added another percentage point to sales growth in the quarter, primarily the Canadian dollar's appreciation over the U.S. dollar, which rose dramatically starting in the 2007 second quarter. Sales were negatively affected by approximately 1 percentage point due to the timing of the Easter holiday falling in March this year and April last year. Sales in Grainger's branch-based business, which includes operations in the United States, Mexico, and China, increased 6%. Sales were positively affected by 3 percentage points from the growth initiatives and negatively affected by approximately 1 percentage point due to the Easter holiday. In addition, a decline in the sales of seasonal products resulted in about a 1 percentage point reduction in the sales growth rate for the quarter. Sales in the United States increased 6%. The 6% sales increase was driven by growth to virtually all customer end markets. Here is a complete list. Government, light manufacturing and commercial were up mid single-digits. It is important to note that our government business was up against a difficult comparison. Last year in the first quarter, government was the strongest category, growing in the mid-20% range. In 2007, we benefited from a large contract with the State of California for Homeland Security products. This contract concluded in May 2007. Heavy-manufacturing, contractor and reseller were up low single-digits. Retail was down low single-digits and was the only customer sector that was negative in the quarter. On a geographic basis, within in the United States, we saw strength in the south central Pacific mountain and Northeast regions, while sales grew at a slower pace in the Great Lakes region. Sales in Mexico were up 17%, 15% in local currency for the quarter. As mentioned earlier, sales growth was negatively affected by the timing of Easter. We estimate that this extended holiday had about a 6 percentage point drag on sales growth in Mexico for the quarter. For the Acklands-Grainger branch-based segment in Canada, sales were up 25%, 7% in local currency. The timing of the Easter holiday had about a 2 percentage point negative effect in Canada as calculated in U.S. dollars. We saw continued strength in the oil sands, mining, and government sectors partially offset by weakness in forestry. The strongest growth was in the Saskatchewan, Quebec, and Atlantic regions. Sales for the Lab Safety Supply segment were up 3%. Sales from the McFeeley's acquisition completed in May 2007 contributed essentially all of the sales growth for the quarter. Sales performance continued to be below expectations due to flat performance with the existing business and the absence of any additional direct marketing acquisitions. We have not yet seen a material improvement in sales growth as a result of the media changes we described at our analyst meeting in November. We are actively evaluating ways to improve the growth of the business. Company sales in March were up 7% on a daily basis. March had one less selling day than a year ago. Foreign exchange contributed about a 1 percentage point growth while the Easter holiday represented about 2 percentage points drag for the month. In the Grainger branch-based segment, March sales were up 5% on a daily basis. The timing of the Easter holiday negatively affected sales growth by about 2 percentage points. Daily sales in the United States for March were up 5%. Let's take a look at results by customer end market for the month. Government was up high single-digits, light manufacturing, contractor, commercial and reseller segments were up low single-digits. Heavy manufacturing and retail were both down in the low single-digits. Sales in Mexico were up 15%, 11% in local currency. Due to the extended Easter holiday celebrated in Mexico, we estimate that the holiday had about a 17 percentage points drag on sales growth. For the Acklands-Grainger branch-based segment daily sales were up 28%, 10% in local currency. For this business, we estimate that Easter had a 7 percentage points drag on sales growth. Sales for the Lab Safety segment in March were up 3%; excluding the sales from the McFeeley's acquisition, lab safety was down 1%. As we move into the second quarter, we are encouraged by the early read on April sales growth. For the first two weeks of April, daily sales growth is tracking ahead of the 7% growth seen in March as we would expect given the comparison with the Easter holiday, last year. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Bill Chapman.
Bill Chapman - Director, Investor Relations: Thanks Laura. Let's move on to review of our key growth initiatives in the United States. During the quarter market expansion and product line expansion continued to deliver incremental sales growth and market share gains. Beginning with market expansion, the company completed 10 branch projects during the quarter including three new branches, two expansions, three relocations, one showroom upgrade and one closure. The sales contribution from each of the market expansion phases is included in the press release. Phases I and III continued to be the strongest, with sales up 11% in both. Phase V was up 7% with Phoenix particularly strong in the quarter. Phase II, which includes Southern California was up 6%, due impart to some large orders in Los Angeles. Similarly, Phase VI was up 6% with South Florida dragging down the rest of the cities in that phase. Finally, Phase VI was up 5%, and the Bay area was the slowest performer in that phase. While sales results in the top 25 markets were affected by the timing of the Easter holiday in March, these markets delivered sales growth that exceeded the rest of the network. Moving on to the product line expansion program, we added approximately 44,000 new products in the most recently issued catalog, bringing the total numbers of items to 183,000. The new products included fleet maintenance, power transmission and additional line extensions. We remain pleased by this program's ability to drive growth, and plan to continue to add new products for several more years. First quarter operating earnings for the company increased by 14% versus the 2007 first quarter. The majority of the improvement came from the Grainger branch-based segment, and Acklands-Grainger. This 14% increase for the company was the result of positive operating leverage, attained through the 7% sales growth in operating expenses, which grew 5%. Let's take a look at the operating performances by segment. Operating earnings for the Grainger branch-based business increased 10%, versus the 2007 first quarter. Operating margins increased 45 basis points to 12.8%. This margin expansion was primarily the result of positive operating expense leverage combined with a 10 basis point improvement in gross margins for this segment. Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined 36 basis points, despite absorbing operating losses from the businesses in China and Mexico. In 2007, we decided to accelerate the expansion program in Mexico to be the first to establish a nationwide footprint. Since we are in an investment mode and plan to open nine new branches in 2008, we expect some short-term losses. In China, our investments are made ahead of the expected sales response. We know that other companies experience losses for several years before reaching breakeven. We continue to monitor the results closely, knowing that China remains a huge opportunity for MRO distribution. Operating expenses in the U.S. branch-based business also included a higher provision for bad debt expense. The company has elected to provide for bad debts at the 2007 full year rate. We believe that this approach is prudent as we worked to improve our collection efficiency during the year. We added collection agents while working on long-term technology solutions. Pretax ROIC for this segment declined 40 basis points to 36% reflecting improvements in operating performance, offset by additional investments in working capital. Let's move on to the Acklands-Grainger branch-based segment, where operating earnings increased 30% for the quarter, the result of the 25% sales increase in improved gross profit margins. Operating margins in Canada increased 30 basis points to 6.6% from 6.3% in the 2007 first quarter, as the result of the higher gross profit margin partially offset by higher operating expenses. Pre-tax RIOC improved to 12.5% versus 11.4% a year ago. We remain delighted by the continued turnaround orchestrated by the Acklands-Grainger management team. Operating earnings for the Lab Safety segment increased by about 1 percentage point for the first quarter versus 2007. The 3% sales growth combined with higher medical costs were primarily responsible for this performance. Lab remains a highly profitable business with the highest operating earnings as a percent of sales of all the segments, although the sluggish sales growth remains a disappointment. Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow. Operating cash flow was $13 million for the quarter. Cash flow is historically lighter in the first quarter versus the remainder of the year, because in March the company makes its annual contribution to its profit sharing plan and awards incentive plan payments. This is also the time of year when the company traditionally builds inventory in preparation for the summer season. During the quarter the company used its cash flow and short-term debt to fund growth initiatives through capital expenditures of $36 million, and return cash to shareholders through dividends of $28 million and $196 million in share repurchases. As announced on April 4, the company is arranging a four year term loan of up to $500 million. Proceeds from the loan are expected to be used primarily to pay off short-term debt, which at the end of the quarter was $330 million, and to fund additional share repurchases. Although market conditions will dictate the final details of the financing arrangement, we anticipate that the debt will carry a floating interest rate tied to the LIBOR rate and will begin to amortize in the second year of the loan. I also want to mention our comments in the press release about the GSA contract, which in 2007, represented less than 2% of total company revenue. Today's press release notes that while we have started the process of meeting with government, these issues may take a long time to resolve. We don't know how long it will take, but what the outcome will be. Going forward, we will provide you an update in our public filings. As mentioned in today's earnings release, we raised both the lower and upper ends of the earnings per share range; and we now expect 2008 earnings per share a $5.80 to $6.10. Looking forward, here are some additional items to consider as you think about the 2008 second quarter. The 2007 second quarter included $2.8 million or $0.02 a share for gains on the sale of assets. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 38.9% in 2008 versus the 38.5% in 2007. Excluding the effect of equity in net income from unconsolidated entities, and finally we expect to close on the term loan in early May. To conclude, we are very pleased about the results for the quarter with sales up 7%, net earnings up 12% and earnings per share up 22%. And we remain optimistic about our full year performance as evidenced by our revised earnings per share guidance. Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Our annual meeting will be on April 30th. Please mark your calendar also for May12, when we plan to issue sales results for the month of April.
